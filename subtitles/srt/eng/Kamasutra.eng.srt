1
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:03,140
Come on!

2
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,921
This is Calcutta, India.

3
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,854
I'm at Victoria
Memorial Hospital.

4
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:57,550
A miracle is about to
happen at this hospital.

5
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:02,362
A woman who has been sleeping
for more than a thousand years...

6
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:04,433
...is going to wake up now.

7
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:06,458
Her name is Surya.

8
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:10,636
She is a princess of the
Guptas that ruled northern India...

9
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:12,570
...from the 4th to the 6th century.

10
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:15,008
I'm going to be interviewing...

11
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:23,652
Dr. Aikawa, an archaeologist studying
the Kama Sutra, the one who found her.

12
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:28,521
Doctor, would you tell us
how you found Princess Surya?

13
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:33,056
And that was the story.

14
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:35,927
I see, it must have
been a difficult experience.

15
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:39,491
Oh no, compared to the troubles the
princess had, it was nothing.

16
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:42,935
Now, I'd like to ask
several questions about her.

17
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,676
It is difficult to thaw frozen meat
or flesh because the cells are fragile.

18
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:53,115
How can you restore the body to life?

19
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:54,882
I don't know, myself.

20
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:57,914
Not with modern technology, I mean.

21
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:59,386
What do you mean?

22
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:01,452
Semen and love juice.

23
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:05,986
Love juice?

24
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:11,092
You know, you got wet when you did
something with your boyfriend...

25
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:14,364
Well, you know now!

26
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:15,161
Grandpa!

27
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:17,003
Oh, Ryu!

28
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,398
I love you, Ryu.

29
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,738
What's the matter?

30
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:23,743
I felt Yukari kiss me.

31
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,173
That's impossible...

32
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:26,772
Who is he, Doctor?

33
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,181
My grandson, Ryu.

34
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:28,945
Nice to meet you.

35
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:31,816
And this is my assistant, Shakty.

36
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:33,752
I'm Yakko!

37
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:37,219
You can call me Indy, though...

38
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:40,093
...if you'd like to...

39
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:44,594
Most of the ice around
her has been removed.

40
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:47,864
The preparation for revival
is in its last stage now.

41
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:52,469
Doctor, I suppose
this is the hardest step now.

42
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:54,738
Shakty, give me the cup.

43
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:56,837
Yes sir, it's ready.

44
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,875
What's that, Doctor?

45
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,279
The Sex Cup...

46
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,681
This is the answer to
your previous question.

47
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:04,945
What do you mean?

48
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:08,184
The legendary cup
that gives eternal life.

49
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:11,293
We put semen and love juice into this.

50
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:15,060
Semen and love juice?

51
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:15,922
That's right.

52
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:18,033
And, look what happens.

53
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:36,908
Doctor, is she...

54
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,645
Just pray to God.

55
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:43,819
Prayers are unnecessary.

56
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:50,695
The power of that cup is
not given to just anybody.

57
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,133
It can only be given to
the ones that God loves.

58
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:58,171
And that is Surya.

59
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:03,942
And, the one she weds.

60
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:16,388
Doc!

61
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:17,683
Look!

62
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:39,241
Gopal...

63
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:51,517
He's dead now.

64
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:18,815
My father, Beshuma,
the old shaman of our tribe...

65
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:20,684
...has just passed away.

66
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:25,893
From now on, I, Rudracin will succeed
my father as the head of the Naga Tribe.

67
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,298
Surya and the Sex Cup will be ours
soon after the mourning period expires.

68
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:35,461
It was my father's unrealized dream.

69
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:37,300
Follow me!

70
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:41,202
Eternal life will belong
to the snake tribe, Naga!

71
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,513
Ryu!

72
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:59,261
Take a break and have some donuts.

73
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:05,724
We're going to take Surya downtown.

74
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:07,663
Will you help her to the car?

75
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:08,802
Okay...

76
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:10,670
But, are you all right Surya?

77
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:13,173
Thank you, but you worry too much.

78
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,506
I can even walk now.

79
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,441
See?

80
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:20,243
Sorry, Ryu.

81
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,579
You've been sleeping for
more than a thosand years.

82
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:24,251
Take it easy on yourself.

83
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,954
It's all right, I just took a wrong step.

84
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,757
Sorry to keep you waiting, Miss Surya.

85
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:35,221
Watch your step.

86
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:38,756
See you later!

87
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,507
It's time to learn, Ryu.

88
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,504
Learn about what?

89
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:49,472
Doc asked me to teach you.

90
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,410
In Japan, they go like this...

91
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:54,675
Come on baby, I'll teach you how.

92
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:56,775
Come on!

93
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:10,792
Is this what I'm going to learn?

94
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,992
The actual skills of the Kama Sutra...

95
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:18,337
If you love Surya,
you must become a man yourself first.

96
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:20,573
But, I...

97
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:23,173
You're such a wimp.

98
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:26,576
I'm going to pinch you.

99
00:11:20,803 --> 00:11:22,566
This is the missionary position.

100
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:30,437
This is the chamber of
the missionary position.

101
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:35,381
We can't take any other position.

102
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:37,344
How can we get out?

103
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:45,589
If you keep moving your hips to shake
the floor, it will part and let us out.

104
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:46,884
My hips?

105
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:51,594
Right.

106
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:53,858
First slowly...

107
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,969
Don't rush.

108
00:11:57,473 --> 00:11:58,770
Slowly...

109
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,136
Harder...

110
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:02,274
Deeper...

111
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:01,997
This is the chamber of
the female-on-top position.

112
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:05,133
Enjoy the feeling of my skills.

113
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:54,815
Shakty...

114
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:57,553
Forget the skills...

115
00:13:57,727 --> 00:14:00,560
Okay, let's go for it!

116
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:27,548
This is the chamber of
the sixty-nine position.

117
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:30,217
This time, enjoy my tongue.

118
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,265
Shakty...

119
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:10,926
You must have missed this.

120
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,560
Yes, it has not changed at all.

121
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:20,302
Truly...

122
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:31,417
Doc.

123
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:35,317
It's the press, I'm a famous man now.

124
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,891
Famous among lechers.

125
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,358
Hey, here they come!

126
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:47,367
Hi!

127
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,601
Naga!

128
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:52,269
Yakko!

129
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:53,340
Got it!

130
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:58,040
Think you can escape?

131
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:08,050
Mommy!

132
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:14,788
Something to throw,
something to throw...

133
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:22,497
Something to throw,
something to throw...

134
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:25,462
Wiper on!

135
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:36,280
Boss, we'll be in the
shopping district soon!

136
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:37,619
I know that!

137
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:38,448
This game is over!

138
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:57,996
I have come to take
you back, Princess Surya.

139
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:09,614
Damn it...

140
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,455
Ryu, take it easy.

141
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:22,692
Yeah.

142
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:33,841
Yes, yes...

143
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:34,967
It's for you.

144
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:35,873
For me?

145
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:40,237
Yes, Ryu speaking.

146
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,708
Ryu, it's me, Yukari!

147
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:45,278
I've just arrived at the hotel.

148
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:47,513
I waited for you to call but you didn't.

149
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,887
So, I came after you!

150
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:51,924
I want to see you now,
will you come over?

151
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:54,256
Damn it, I'm too busy now!

152
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:56,164
You're so mean!

153
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:57,859
I've come here all the way from Tokyo!

154
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:00,564
All right, I'm jumping
out the hotel window.

155
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:02,297
Hey, wait a second, um...

156
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:04,672
You can use the
telephone in Surya's room.

157
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:07,275
Hold on, I'm changing lines.

158
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:11,512
I envy young people.

159
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,750
That's the reason.

160
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,582
You see?

161
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:22,316
So, I'll call you in a few days.

162
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:23,756
I promise.

163
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:25,723
I'm hanging up now, okay?

164
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:44,511
Is it my imagination?

165
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:53,182
Ryu!

166
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:54,722
A-A snake...

167
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:04,899
There aren't any snakes.

168
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,264
Oh, stand up already.

169
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:07,927
My legs...

170
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:11,097
It's surprising that you have no guts.

171
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:13,368
He hates snakes by nature.

172
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:16,607
Anything long is...

173
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:24,683
Doc!

174
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:26,821
I was just joking.

175
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:33,893
Doc!

176
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:49,037
Get on the train bound to Cuttack
leaving at 9:30 A.M. tomorrow.

177
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:54,545
Be sure to bring the cup, if you report
this to the police, Surya will be in trouble.

178
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:00,320
Come in.

179
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:03,953
Oh, the porter.

180
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:05,793
We don't want any food.

181
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:07,050
W-Wait a minute.

182
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,857
Where is the cup?

183
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:15,300
Is that the real one?

184
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:18,530
What about you, did you bring Surya?

185
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,365
You are quite dashing.

186
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:23,835
Woman, my man is waiting outside.

187
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,070
Go with him.

188
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:43,030
Come in!

189
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:46,260
Surya!

190
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:47,027
Shakty!

191
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:49,503
I was so worried.

192
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:50,867
That's close enough!

193
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,308
Business first.

194
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:54,934
Hello.

195
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:56,204
Hello, Shakty?

196
00:20:56,412 --> 00:20:57,970
Oh, Ryu, Surya is safe!

197
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,107
I see, I'm glad.

198
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:01,414
You want to talk to her?

199
00:21:01,517 --> 00:21:02,108
Yeah.

200
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:03,540
All right, wait.

201
00:21:04,353 --> 00:21:05,377
Hello, Ryu?

202
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:05,987
Surya!

203
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:10,488
Ryu, I knew you
would come to help me.

204
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:13,994
Just hold on, we'll have
a happy ending soon.

205
00:21:15,364 --> 00:21:15,989
Ryu...

206
00:21:16,532 --> 00:21:17,464
Surya...

207
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:26,968
How romantic...

208
00:21:27,443 --> 00:21:30,241
That's enough, give me the cup now.

209
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:32,680
You should listen to this first.

210
00:21:34,183 --> 00:21:35,377
What are you doing here?

211
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:36,143
Police!

212
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:37,252
You're under arrest!

213
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:41,418
You never meant to trade
from the beginning, didn't you?

214
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,224
How embarrassing...

215
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:49,831
You must pay for this.

216
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,431
I won't bargain with the price.

217
00:21:52,735 --> 00:21:53,497
Good.

218
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:17,690
The final blow!

219
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:21,821
Yeah!

220
00:22:23,832 --> 00:22:25,800
Hi, you made it, Ryu!

221
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:28,893
It serves you right!

222
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:36,039
The drama has just started, Mr. Ryu.

223
00:22:55,564 --> 00:22:56,656
I got the cup.

224
00:22:57,366 --> 00:23:01,530
I'll come back to get Surya later!

225
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:07,199
Surya!

226
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:13,211
Ryu...

227
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:15,979
Ryu!

228
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:23,889
Where am I?

229
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:25,584
In the hospital in Calcutta.

230
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:31,027
You've been unconscious for two days,
it must be a shock losing you lover--

231
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:39,205
The doctor said you have to stay still.

232
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:44,002
The policemen are keeping watch
outside and we'll be taking turns staying here.

233
00:23:44,313 --> 00:23:45,302
Well tonight--

234
00:23:45,414 --> 00:23:46,472
I'll stay!

235
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:49,513
For Ryu, I'll do my best!

236
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:54,412
Doc...

237
00:23:57,693 --> 00:24:00,253
Please take care of her, Yukari.

238
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:03,091
Will you keep an eye on Yukari?

239
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:04,631
Don't worry!

240
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:28,588
Do you want to help Ryu?

241
00:24:28,724 --> 00:24:31,284
In that case, we'll trade him for Surya.

242
00:24:31,894 --> 00:24:34,294
I can't do that, never!

243
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,693
I see.

244
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:49,606
Oh, no, how terrible!

245
00:24:49,745 --> 00:24:52,509
You know what to do, right?

246
00:24:58,253 --> 00:24:59,720
Forgive me, Surya.

247
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,052
I have to help Ryu.

248
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:06,489
Women will do anything for love!

249
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:08,958
Hello, Yukari!

250
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:18,273
It's too easy.

251
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:21,205
Boys, let's get going!

252
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,205
W-Wait a second!

253
00:25:25,414 --> 00:25:27,075
Where's Ryu?

254
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:28,011
You promised me!

255
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:30,084
I know that, come on out!

256
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:48,298
What's this, a fake?

257
00:25:48,403 --> 00:25:49,267
Yukari!

258
00:25:49,905 --> 00:25:51,372
What are you doing?

259
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:51,939
Gee!

260
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:55,437
Wait a minute, Yukari!

261
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:08,882
I love to hear screams.

262
00:26:27,643 --> 00:26:28,075
What?

263
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:36,175
Did some bird crash into this?

264
00:27:00,108 --> 00:27:02,599
Ryu, we've got Surya.

265
00:27:02,744 --> 00:27:03,301
What?

266
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:05,676
I brought you your lover instead.

267
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:07,781
Have a nice time!

268
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,177
But just a short while.

269
00:27:10,786 --> 00:27:12,014
Bye-bye!

270
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:16,318
Ryu, I missed you so much!

271
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:18,224
What's this all about, Yukari?

272
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,796
I couldn't help it, they
said they would kill you.

273
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,295
You mean you...

274
00:27:23,465 --> 00:27:24,796
I couldn't help it...

275
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:27,323
I just couldn't...

276
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:30,972
Do you know what you've done?

277
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,167
It's all over now.

278
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:36,972
They don't have any
reason to let us live now.

279
00:27:37,713 --> 00:27:40,238
Oh, no, what will we do, Ryu?

280
00:27:40,782 --> 00:27:42,306
I don't know...

281
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:57,894
Open the door!

282
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:03,269
You will be as flat as a pancake!

283
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:07,071
Take off your clothes!

284
00:28:07,709 --> 00:28:10,507
Put them between the walls and
the floor to stop them from moving.

285
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:11,972
Hurry up!

286
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,739
Okay!

287
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:14,910
Shit!

288
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:24,249
How about your side?

289
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,485
No, it won't stop!

290
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:35,469
What's going on with your body?

291
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,970
Well, it's kind of a reflex.

292
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:43,003
I'm in...

293
00:29:01,963 --> 00:29:04,158
Is this our last...

294
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:05,796
Y-Yeah...

295
00:29:07,936 --> 00:29:08,800
We're gonna die...

296
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:10,132
Is that you, Yukari?

297
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:12,370
You can't die, hold on--

298
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:13,600
My goodness!

299
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:15,734
Just help us out!

300
00:29:15,844 --> 00:29:17,607
We'll be crushed, hurry up!

301
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:18,906
Okay, guys!

302
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:27,755
Here I go!

303
00:29:28,824 --> 00:29:31,315
Good thing I can piss high!

304
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:38,389
It stopped...

305
00:29:47,075 --> 00:29:48,007
How's the drug?

306
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:49,866
It will lose its effect soon.

307
00:29:52,113 --> 00:29:54,911
We'll hold a wedding until she is awake.

308
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:57,044
We're already prepared.

309
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:00,049
Eternal life will be ours.

310
00:30:17,172 --> 00:30:18,298
Oh, Grandpa!

311
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:20,504
Oh, you're safe.

312
00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:21,870
But how did you...

313
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:23,305
Yukari brought us here.

314
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:24,137
Huh?

315
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,015
We planted a tracer on her shirt.

316
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:31,346
We put them on everyone, just in case.

317
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:35,979
It's started!

318
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:41,355
We have reported to the
police, too, they're very quick.

319
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:42,327
Let me see.

320
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:03,807
Indian Police sure
like to put on a show.

321
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:06,519
They aren't the police, they're soldiers!

322
00:31:08,123 --> 00:31:09,021
Where's Surya?

323
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:29,202
I'm sorry but we
cannot get married today.

324
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:32,839
It seems we thought too
lightly of your friend.

325
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:40,011
Princess Surya, we must leave now.

326
00:31:40,588 --> 00:31:42,579
What if I say, "No"?

327
00:31:44,392 --> 00:31:46,826
Then I must act disrespectfully.

328
00:31:49,597 --> 00:31:51,861
You already are disrespectful.

329
00:31:54,602 --> 00:31:55,364
This way.

330
00:32:16,324 --> 00:32:17,188
Ryu!

331
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:19,387
Over there, it's Surya!

332
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:20,456
What?

333
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:27,892
Surya!

334
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:29,103
Where are you going?

335
00:32:29,204 --> 00:32:31,069
I'll go ahead and save Surya!

336
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:33,140
Wait, Ryu!

337
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,036
Shambala?

338
00:32:37,145 --> 00:32:40,137
Yes, the underground
utopia, Shambala.

339
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:43,779
This cup will lead us there.

340
00:32:46,254 --> 00:32:46,913
What is it?

341
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:51,923
You can go to Shambala, but
you cannot have what you desire.

342
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:55,055
What I want is eternal life.

343
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,263
Only the one who gets
married to you in Shambala...

344
00:32:58,466 --> 00:33:02,334
...and drink from this
cup can have eternal life.

345
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:04,865
Isn't that right?

346
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,401
That is correct, however...

347
00:33:09,744 --> 00:33:10,768
Surya!

348
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:11,838
Ryu!

349
00:33:12,047 --> 00:33:13,275
He's still alive?

350
00:33:34,302 --> 00:33:35,269
What is that?

351
00:33:39,107 --> 00:33:40,768
The entrance to Shambala.

352
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:45,008
Surya!

353
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:50,648
Drive through it!

354
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:51,582
Don't be rash!

355
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:52,653
Just do it!

356
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:53,379
Ouch!

357
00:33:53,488 --> 00:33:54,853
Just drive through it!

358
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,607
The sun is underground?

359
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:20,142
That is the cosmic egg...

360
00:34:20,582 --> 00:34:22,379
The birthplace of the gods...

361
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,643
The egg of the new world...

362
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:28,485
The best place to
consummate our love.

363
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:00,947
All right, that's them!

364
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,456
Can you swim, Ryu?

365
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,651
There aren't any boats here.

366
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:09,492
I'll walk across if I have to!

367
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,636
Do you wish to cross
over to the island?

368
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:20,897
Yes...

369
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:24,812
It's expensive, can you afford it?

370
00:35:26,581 --> 00:35:28,071
What about me?

371
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,445
The sidekick can go later.

372
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:32,075
Sidekick?

373
00:35:40,461 --> 00:35:43,760
One, two, three...

374
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:45,297
Forty-eight?

375
00:35:47,135 --> 00:35:49,228
My condolences.

376
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:08,519
Please go up to the altar.

377
00:36:13,695 --> 00:36:14,525
Let me go!

378
00:36:38,886 --> 00:36:40,854
Hold it, you damn snake!

379
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:45,790
Don't lay a finger on her!

380
00:36:45,994 --> 00:36:46,619
Ryu!

381
00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:51,564
Mr. Ryu, you are as
tenacious as a snake yourself.

382
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,228
I hate snakes!

383
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:55,532
I meant to compliment you.

384
00:36:56,204 --> 00:36:59,037
Please stay here, I will take care of him.

385
00:37:11,853 --> 00:37:13,184
Choose your weapon.

386
00:37:13,288 --> 00:37:14,084
Weapon?

387
00:37:14,822 --> 00:37:18,383
This is Shambala, if you want
something, just imagine it in your mind.

388
00:37:31,606 --> 00:37:33,574
That's not fair...

389
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:36,402
Fool, this is the right
way to arm yourself.

390
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:55,353
Too bad, you missed.

391
00:37:57,765 --> 00:37:58,697
Ryu, behind you!

392
00:38:03,137 --> 00:38:05,799
It must have gone all
the way to the outfield.

393
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,298
Where did he go?

394
00:38:17,118 --> 00:38:18,210
A snake!

395
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:43,169
Remember your previous life, Ryu!

396
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:45,438
You were a knight before!

397
00:38:57,191 --> 00:38:59,955
This is for what
happened 1,500 years ago!

398
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:49,674
Human beings.

399
00:39:49,877 --> 00:39:52,778
Your fate is decided.

400
00:39:57,118 --> 00:40:03,148
Surya will fall into a long sleep
again after she has made love.

401
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:10,691
It is done in order to save mankind
after the world is destroyed.

402
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:14,425
In order to save good people.

403
00:40:15,036 --> 00:40:18,767
This truly is eternal life.

404
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,837
The pure nature of life is destructive.

405
00:40:23,077 --> 00:40:25,807
Human beings are so good.

406
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,445
So good...

407
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:35,979
Yukari!
