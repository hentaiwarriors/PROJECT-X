1
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,720
Starvation will kill me before
these stupid monsters will!

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,551
Maybe the time's come to give
civilization another try.

3
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,660
What's going on?

4
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,939
Hey! Anybody home?

5
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,676
Talk about screwy setups.

6
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,612
Not a soul around.

7
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,842
I can't believe that even
the bars are closed.

8
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,520
This is ridiculous.

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,555
Can't a guy even buy a meal
in this burg?

10
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,525
What a pathetic excuse for a city!

11
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,016
Maybe I should check out that castle.

12
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:19,209
DRAGON KNIGHT

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,606
Ouch!

14
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:26,653
Hey, take it easy! Didn't anyone ever
tell you girls are the weaker sex?

15
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,455
Will someone explain this
ruffian's presence?

16
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,156
Yes, Your Highness.

17
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,826
After breaking into the palace kitchen,

18
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,886
this knave proceeded to
ravish the royal pantry.

19
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:39,299
Stealing food? How vulgar!

20
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,000
Now, wait just a second!

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,936
I was out there yelling, "Yoo hoo!"
until I turned blue,

22
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,335
and nobody saw fit to answer me!

23
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,606
What can I say? My stomach
was empty,

24
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,975
and my eyes saw food on the table,

25
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,377
so my arm decided it was time
to take matters in hand!

26
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:54,948
"Breakfasting and Entering"
is the charge.

27
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,816
Is eating on the sly a habit of yours?

28
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,051
Not on your life!

29
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,752
Takeru Yamato's the name,

30
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,655
freelance adventurer, philosopher,
and party animal.

31
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,892
I also swing a pretty mean sword,
if you know what I mean.

32
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,262
We have no need for sword swingers
here, freelance or otherwise.

33
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:12,132
We're just a bunch of
simple women here.

34
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,333
Take him out and banish him!

35
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:13,933
Right!

36
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,063
Please, don't!

37
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,761
Please don't, Your Majesty!

38
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,969
Luna?

39
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,283
Your Highness, have you forgotten
the words of the prophet?

40
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:34,387
What of the promised hero, the
one who will deliver Strawberry
Fields from this curse?

41
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,355
Can we take the chance
of ousting him?

42
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,225
He's the hero?

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,995
The hero?

44
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,597
Yes! Now I remember the prophecy:

45
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,299
"When darkened fields
are stripped of flowers

46
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,067
and leaves, out of season,
begin to change,

47
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,336
the moon shall light our waking hours,

48
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,640
and the hero shall come from
the southern range."

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,044
I know he looks pretty bad, but first
impressions can be deceiving.

50
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,080
Excuse me for not measuring up!

51
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,015
There is no doubt in my mind;
he is the promised hero.

52
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,576
I see.

53
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,120
Takeru Yamato, seeing
as you are the hero,

54
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,953
I have a favor to ask of you.

55
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,829
Once this was the most
beautiful of countries.

56
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,731
The blessings of the
goddess were many

57
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,495
and the waters of the Fountain of
Happiness flowed throughout the land.

58
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:26,873
Then, one day, a dark cloud appeared
and enveloped the Goddess' tower.

59
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,409
Suddenly, the water from the magic
fountain ceased to flow,

60
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,070
taking with it our happiness.

61
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,481
The following day, our Goddess
was returned.

62
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,142
This is how we found her.

63
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,793
Encased in stone...

64
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,530
This was the work of the
Dragon Knight clan.

65
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,098
Dragon Knight?

66
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,066
Indeed.

67
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,335
The Dragon Knight overlord
made a proclamation...

68
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:59,472
Dark clouds are trendy!
The days of Good are gone!

69
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,806
The power of Evil shall triumph,
so let's party till we drop!

70
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,080
It was a really stupid speech!

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,571
A showdown between the forces
of Good and Evil...

72
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,810
What's the story on these holes?

73
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,322
They're the key to the
Goddess' powers.

74
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,192
Six jewels fit the six holes.

75
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,729
To restore the Goddess we must
retrieve these jewels.

76
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,498
The jewels being in the hands of
the Dragon Knights, I suppose?

77
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,699
That's right.

78
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,435
Either the Overlord's, or one
of his five Dragon Knights.

79
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,738
To make matters worse,
they've also captured

80
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,740
all the warriors we sent after them.

81
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,608
Even as we speak, they're somewhere
in that dark tower, being tortured.

82
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,313
A tear!

83
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:45,351
Even sealed in stone, she weeps
for us. It breaks my heart.

84
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:50,223
Brave Takeru, this is the path
destiny has chosen for you!

85
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,326
Rescue our fallen warriors! Restore
peace and tranquility to our land.

86
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,629
Do these things, and not only shall I
drop the criminal charges against you,

87
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,597
I will grant you any wish you desire.

88
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,466
Now, wait just a second.

89
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,437
Didn't you say something about there
being some monsters involved?

90
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,939
Are you frightened?
Aren't you a MAN?

91
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,143
No, that's not it exactly...

92
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,079
But how can you abandon
all those lovely warriors?

93
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,447
Lovely?

94
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,905
Indeed! Some even prettier than me!

95
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,085
Really?

96
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,388
So, that's how it is.

97
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,024
You know, this "Goddess in a Rock"
business has really touched my heart,

98
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,685
and I could certainly
use the exercise.

99
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,426
You'll do it? Oh, brave Takeru!

100
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,156
But I wouldn't put any money on it!

101
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,647
There's something I've been
wanting to ask you.

102
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,207
33, 22, 32!

103
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:54,710
No, not THAT! What's the deal
with all those swords?

104
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,991
Those mark the graves of the men
who've gone into the tower before you.

105
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,697
That's one thing about those Dragon
Knights; they really follow through.

106
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,927
They even dig the holes themselves!

107
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:12,105
That's just swell. I have a bad feeling
about this whole concept.

108
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,907
What are you saying? We have
no choice but to continue!

109
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:15,999
I guess not.

110
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,011
Oh well, since it's babes
in bondage we're after,

111
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,814
it's a good thing I brought
my trusty instant camera!

112
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,679
I don't understand him at all.

113
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,053
This way.

114
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,332
Hey!

115
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,402
If you knew the way all along,
why didn't you say something?

116
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,272
Don't be dense! Why did you
think I came along?

117
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,604
Because you were swayed by my
awesome good looks, of course.

118
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,215
Jeez, what a wimpy monster!

119
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,724
He really is the hero!
He's incredibly good!

120
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:05,713
What's that?

121
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,132
Stop it!

122
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,827
Golly! He's whipping her!

123
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,505
So, where do you want it next,
sweet thing?

124
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,505
Please don't do this.

125
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,115
If you want me to stop,

126
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,721
you have only to give me the secret of
the jewels the Dragon Knights want.

127
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,390
That...

128
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,461
Since you weren't listening, I guess
I'm going to have to do it again!

129
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,359
Hold it!

130
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,832
Who the hell are you?

131
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,235
I don't give my name out to
dungeon fodder like you.

132
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,668
You son of a bitch!

133
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,037
Are you all right?

134
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,498
Thank you so much!

135
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:00,213
I'm Sheela, a warrior from
Strawberry Fields. And you?

136
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,849
He's Takeru Yamato, the
hero of the prophecy!

137
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,586
The queen sent him here to
defeat the Dragon Knights!

138
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,222
Well, that's very nice, but...

139
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,224
Could you please untie these ropes?

140
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,758
Oh, sure thing!

141
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,352
But first, let's preserve this priceless
moment on celluloid!

142
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:20,366
What are you doing?
Untie her this instant!

143
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,596
Sure, sure! Boy, do you get scary!

144
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,106
Excuse me, you don't have to do that.

145
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,166
Don't worry. It's not a problem!

146
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,779
Not there!

147
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,982
Hurry up!

148
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,414
The Dragon Knights and their Overlord
have one jewel each.

149
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,656
Each Dragon Knight can be found on
his own personal level of this tower.

150
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,796
The queen needs a full report,
so I'll head back to the castle.

151
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:51,785
Good luck!

152
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,526
Hey, wait! I need your three sizes
and your telephone number!

153
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,085
Please stop it. Please.

154
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,391
Of course we'll stop,

155
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,993
once you tell us the secret
of the jewels.

156
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,393
I don't know anything, nothing at all.

157
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,898
What a stubborn little bitch.

158
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,634
All right, let's take it from
the bottom again.

159
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,702
No problem!

160
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,466
You'd better be ready,
'cause here I come!

161
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,775
Stop...

162
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,543
Not there...

163
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,669
Stop...

164
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,505
That looks enjoyable!

165
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,314
No, don't!

166
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,158
I can't believe I'm jealous of
a bunch of lounge lizards!

167
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,593
It's a filthy human!

168
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,961
Are you going to fuck with us?

169
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,795
Wouldn't dream of it. I'm just
going to kill you!

170
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,532
That's that, you perverted
handbag wanna-bes.

171
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,202
Perfect! What a picture!

172
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,041
Hey, wake up!

173
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,881
Oh yeah, this is the way
to wake a girl up!

174
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,627
You're here to rescue them,
nothing else.

175
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,494
But of course! It was just a thought.

176
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,671
Who are you?

177
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:42,942
Takeru's the name. The queen
sent me to rescue you!

178
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,211
I'm Jane, but...

179
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,042
Why is your hand where it is?

180
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,647
For goodness sake! I guess
it just got there by itself!

181
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,754
Hey, come on, lighten up!

182
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,226
I'm not mad at you.

183
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,423
You say you're not, but you are.

184
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:08,795
It's not as if I have to get permission
from you or anything, right?

185
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,736
Isn't that right?

186
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,875
I don't...

187
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,864
Luna!

188
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,277
Luna!

189
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,608
LUNA!

190
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,908
LUNA!

191
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,081
I'm sure Takeru is doing his best.

192
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:33,259
After all, he is the hero
of the prophecy.

193
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,922
Well, my prophecies have
never been wrong before.

194
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,091
Only three jewels left to go.

195
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,692
Godspeed, Takeru. We await
your safe return.

196
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,598
Who's there?

197
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,200
As beautiful as we were told!

198
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,680
We are vassals of the Lord
of the Dragon Knights.

199
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,285
I am Green Dragon, one of
the Dragon Knight clan.

200
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:04,222
We have been sent to put some
questions before you, Your Majesty.

201
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:09,187
Give us the answers quickly and
nothing too repulsive shall befall you.

202
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,694
Takeru...

203
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,707
This is getting rather repetitive.

204
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,580
You Lose

205
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,225
Now, Lady Queen, you will
tell me everything.

206
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:43,596
What is the secret of the jewels,
and who is this hero Takeru?

207
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,299
I have nothing to say to
lowly filth such as you!

208
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,502
I can respect that, Your Majesty.

209
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,773
But I cannot help but wonder how long
you'll hold that regal pose.

210
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,740
Do it!

211
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,349
What do you think you're doing?

212
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,752
The royal orbs are truly magnificent!

213
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,220
I would like to touch them.

214
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,293
Go to hell, you stupid jerk!

215
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,496
My, my, such offensive language!

216
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,555
Let's see what you say to this!

217
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:30,405
Now that's what I call royal splendor!
Shall we get on with this?

218
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,611
That hurt!

219
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,315
What the hell is going on here?

220
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,907
Takeru! Save me!

221
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,386
So, you are the hero, Takeru!

222
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:44,447
Your escapades have really put
a hair up the Overlord's ass!

223
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,594
I take it you're here on business?

224
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,162
You don't look too enthused.

225
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,232
Will you stop talking
and do something?

226
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,601
I'm blushing to the tip of my toes!

227
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,159
So I see.

228
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,771
Get on with it! I could use a
little exercise before lunch!

229
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,538
Now you shall experience the true
power of the Dragon Knights!

230
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,336
Green Dragon!

231
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:19,925
The notion of a pathetic human
fighting one of my kind is laughable!

232
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,415
Attack, Green Dragon!

233
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,104
Your futile evasions only
serve to piss me off!

234
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,814
He's slow, but that fire
could be a pain.

235
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,579
Okay...

236
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,083
Your Majesty! I'm going
to rescue you now!

237
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,663
How is hiding behind that column
going to rescue her?

238
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,153
Dragon, to the right!

239
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,559
Now I've got him!

240
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,538
Dragon, to the LEFT!

241
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,808
I can't believe you did that!

242
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,942
I'll take out the big one first!

243
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,384
You're next, asshole!

244
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,838
One more left?

245
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,243
Strike!

246
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,755
Takeru!

247
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,519
How dare you play with
that priceless jewel!

248
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,929
Chill out! You're not exactly dressed

249
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,726
in your most authoritarian
attitude at the moment!

250
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:16,108
Still, no matter how one looks at it,
Your Majesty's bearing is impressive.

251
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,542
I should thank the Dragon Knights for
showing me such unexpected aspects!

252
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:24,817
Get back to the tower and rescue
the remaining warriors!

253
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,682
Man, talk about a harsh mistress!

254
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,623
Boy, am I hungry.

255
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,661
Her royal highness sure doesn't know
how to show her appreciation.

256
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,322
I never even got a chance
to ask about Luna.

257
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,842
Now what?

258
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,311
He may be ugly, but why pick
on one of his own team?

259
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,243
Hold it!

260
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,312
What the? Human scum!

261
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,149
Yet another pathetic excuse
for a monster.

262
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,384
Are you all right?

263
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,925
Little monsters are safe from me.
Get along now.

264
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,535
Go on, get out of here!

265
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:21,370
I'm here to defeat your associates!
That makes me your enemy, got it?

266
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,240
Suit yourself.

267
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,382
What? That way?

268
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,681
You'll show me where to go? I want
to go to the upper levels!

269
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,509
Dang, the monsters on the
fifth level were tough!

270
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,847
I'll just give myself a
small power boost

271
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,372
with a little bit of the old cheesecake!

272
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:11,523
This is Ann. What an incredible bust!

273
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:16,628
And this is Annie. Intelligent, beautiful,
and with legs that won't quit!

274
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:21,366
Tina! Boy, was I surprised when I lit
that match! Not a stitch in sight!

275
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:25,234
Maria! How sad to think of her, forced
into such a compromising position!

276
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,830
What do you think?
See anything you like?

277
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:34,446
Hey, what's the matter?
Why are you so angry?

278
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,277
You're not jealous, are you?

279
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,916
Hey, hey, hey!

280
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,082
Say, I bet you're female!

281
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,227
Hey, it's all right! I'm right here!

282
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,270
I can't believe we're actually
inside the column!

283
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,897
I found this hidden in here too!

284
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,841
What? Is it really that important?

285
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,121
Takeru, the so-called hero
who snuck into our tower,

286
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,490
has proven to be an unexpectedly
strong adversary.

287
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,358
In only a short time, he has already
defeated four of our Dragon Knights!

288
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,197
You worry too much!

289
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,065
He is only human, after all!

290
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,967
Never could he hope to match one
of such magnificent vileness as I!

291
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,973
But My Liege, he has already
acquired four of the jewels!

292
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,441
Worry not!

293
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:40,979
The only chance he might have
would be to find the White Sword!

294
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,749
But a human, who trusts only what
he can see with his eyes,

295
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,450
will never find that!

296
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,509
Rest assured, Black!

297
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,449
Now where do you suppose the
stairs to the sixth level are?

298
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,722
The other staircase ended
here at the fifth.

299
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,424
Do you know?

300
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,828
I see.

301
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,507
Hey! Something smells good.
I was hungry anyway.

302
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,056
Let's stuff our faces!

303
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,614
What a spread!

304
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,697
This looks particularly appetizing!

305
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,733
Who's copping that feel?
Don't you have any manners?

306
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,724
Yeah, ain't you got no fuckin' couth?

307
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,211
What?

308
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,270
Oh my goodness! It's a human!

309
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,952
You don't suppose he's the human
who's been carving up
the Dragon Knights?

310
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,385
That's right!

311
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,913
Now it's your turn to be
served on a platter!

312
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,726
So, he's going to cook
our goose, is he?

313
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,858
I say we reverse that and serve
HIM as the main course!

314
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,479
Damn, I can't keep an eye
on all of them!

315
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,245
I think I'm getting motion sickness.

316
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,091
Thank you so much!

317
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:36,962
Well, that literally sucked! Every inch
of my body is soaked with drool!

318
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,430
Thanks for saving us, by the way!

319
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,234
I'm Laura and this is Leira.
You're Takeru, right?

320
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,902
How did you know?

321
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,029
The demons were talking about you.

322
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,573
And you've found the
White Sword, as well!

323
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,665
You're talking about this?

324
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:54,340
That's right! You'll need it to defeat
the Dragon Knight Overlord!

325
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,984
Still, the White Sword alone
will not be enough.

326
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,119
Only the daughter of
Strawberry Field's priest

327
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,056
can unleash the power of the sword.

328
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,624
That daughter is Luna!

329
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,888
But I've been looking for Luna!

330
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,887
No one has seen her since
she was taken prisoner.

331
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:15,634
In any case, Black Dragon and his
Overlord still lie in wait above.

332
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,340
Well, you see, I can't find the stairs...

333
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,070
That's the way up, through
the old aqueduct.

334
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,338
But there's no water in the channel!

335
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,646
Once the water poured forth
in endless bounty.

336
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,784
It fed the Fountain of the Goddess
at the top of this tower.

337
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,786
It rushed through here
in rippling torrents,

338
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:39,224
cascading past that window in a
glittering spray of liquid radiance!

339
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,057
But now, because of the Overlord...

340
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,196
All right! I'll take care of it!

341
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,032
I'll put that water back
where it belongs!

342
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,000
So, after I do the hero thing,
how about going out with me?

343
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,396
All right!

344
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,008
That so-called hero's
not going to show.

345
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,445
You think he's turned tail
and gone home?

346
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:04,282
Humans haven't got the guts to
follow a course to its conclusion.

347
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,648
That's certainly the truth!

348
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,053
Hey!

349
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,612
This human's come to finish
the job he's started!

350
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,058
Prepare yourself!

351
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,329
He's right here!

352
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,671
You escaped us once, but never again!

353
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,808
Dang, I knew I should have
finished them off!

354
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,402
Overlord, please let us kill him!

355
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,040
Idiots!

356
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,063
I can't believe you let him
get so close!

357
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,724
Please, forgive us!

358
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,235
You little...

359
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,213
Looks like the old black magic
is having an off day!

360
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,548
He's got the White Sword!

361
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,642
But without the priest's daughter,
it will avail him naught!

362
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,682
You must die!

363
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,463
You call yourself a hero?

364
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,703
Still, I must compliment your
achievement in getting this far.

365
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,180
When I send your queen
to meet her goddess,

366
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,205
you'll be waiting to greet her!

367
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,498
You can't be alive!

368
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,944
My Lord, you must escape! The
child of the priest is...

369
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,375
What was that all about?

370
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,085
Takeru!

371
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:29,782
Luna!

372
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,002
Don't look, you dork!

373
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,470
Sorry...

374
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,740
It's just that you're the prettiest
girl I've ever rescued.

375
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,141
Honest?

376
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,608
It's the truth.

377
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,120
Now let's be reasonable, hero.

378
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,722
Your soul is no purer than
any other human's.

379
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,891
Why not join up with me?

380
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,451
Think of it, all the booze and
broads you can handle!

381
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,294
Unlimited wine and women?

382
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,067
Takeru already has all the woman
he can handle with me!

383
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,870
Powers above, time to fight!
Heaven's spirit is my might!

384
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,068
Fill my body with power bright!
White Sword channel this holy light!

385
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:24,139
Foolish hero! Someday
you'll suffer for this!

386
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,784
That's not too likely, right?

387
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,867
Takeru!

388
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,502
We love you, Takeru!

389
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:45,867
We're all yours, Takeru!

390
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,207
I never thought I'd start
suffering so soon!

391
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,981
I feel my heart

392
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,618
Commanding me

393
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,856
It stipulates

394
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:08,155
I do this immediately

395
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,729
From the time

396
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,490
Of our merger

397
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,504
Since we first met

398
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,029
We've been bound together

399
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:28,412
I'm sending you this gift from me

400
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:36,916
A piece of my heart by telepathy

401
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,482
There's someone else

402
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,019
Who's after you

403
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,461
You're in their sights

404
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,526
And they've got laser guidance too

405
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,130
Please don't bare

406
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,836
Your true feelings

407
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,815
Please don't share

408
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,283
With anyone but me

409
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:12,279
A feeling like ice runs down my spine

410
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:21,193
Don't change yourself for
these feelings of mine

411
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,333
Shooting Lover

412
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,207
Love in shining armor

413
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:33,712
You won't know what hit you

414
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,408
It's just my amour

415
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,752
Shooting Storm

416
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,988
Wish me the best of luck

417
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:48,357
You know this battle's for

418
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,395
Your heart

419
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,162
Even though it really hurts
Your heart

420
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,064
Even though it really hurts

421
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,727
Doing nothing would be
much, much worse

422
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,434
So is this my chance

423
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,510
To win romance

424
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,180
Look at my hands shake

425
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,917
How much can I take

426
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,621
Look straight in my eye

427
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:20,225
I won't be too shy

428
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:23,928
Take me on this dare

429
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:27,489
True love will be there
