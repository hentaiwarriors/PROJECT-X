1
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,290
I'm so sorry.

2
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,410
What're you doing here?

3
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,100
Mika?

4
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,520
You're so pathetic, Big Brother.

5
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,300
You're drooling all over yourself.

6
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,140
Mika!

7
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,990
Urara! Here I come!

8
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,300
Urara...

9
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,290
So, she's Mika's friend.

10
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,800
Boy! Spring's come to young lovers across the world.

11
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,300
But for me, it's always winter.

12
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,750
This sucks!

13
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,380
Hey, Hiromi!

14
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,610
Ha Nanahoshi!

15
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,900
You wanna go for a cup of coffee?

16
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,070
Maybe next time, I've got a prior engagement.

17
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,860
Excuse me! Could you wrap these?

18
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,820
Next time, huh? It's been three years since the first next time.

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,910
It'll always be this way for Hiromi and me.

20
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,360
Yo, Nanahoshi!

21
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,450
Doda?

22
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,540
All alone?

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,080
Well excuse me for being alone.

24
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,820
Catch ya later, Nanahoshi!

25
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,580
Where shall we go next?

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,540
Asshole!

27
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,720
If he takes her to a hotel or something, I'm gonna...

28
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,650
Mom! I asked you to shorten my skirt!

29
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,430
Now I can't go to commencement! It's too embarassing!

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,760
Hiromi!

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Catch me if you can!

32
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,740
Hey, Hiromi! Wait for me!

33
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,870
Don't look...

34
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,600
But you're...

35
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,350
Urara-chan?

36
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,840
Please be gentle, this is my first time.

37
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,900
Urara...

38
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,570
Is this okay?

39
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,450
Yes, softly now...

40
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,940
...so softly...

41
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,280
It was just a dream... I'm really losing it!

42
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,200
Will I spend my senior year just dreaming of girls?

43
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,750
What's up?

44
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,720
Are you lost?

45
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,700
Yes... are you Mika's brother?

46
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm sorry about the other day.

47
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,160
No problem.

48
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,460
Which class are you in?

49
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,690
I'm in 1-A.

50
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,340
Oh, that's my sister's class, too.

51
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,250
Follow me.

52
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,450
Thanks.

53
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,000
Here you go.

54
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,900
Thank you.

55
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,690
Don't mention it.

56
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,370
Urara, I've been looking for you. Oh, Big Brother.

57
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,440
See you later.

58
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,650
What was that about?

59
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,850
Your big brother is so nice.

60
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,010
You think so?

61
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,040
He's just a slob who bums around the house all the time...

62
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,600
Man, my sister's so rotten!

63
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,160
Compared to Urara, they're as different as night and day...

64
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,980
And Urara's light shines so brightly...

65
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,730
Get outta here!

66
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,300
You useless bums have gotta go!

67
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,710
When girls become seniors, they're not so cute and sweet anymore.

68
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,960
Compared to girls like Hiromi who've been corrupted, underclassmen are so pure and innocent...

69
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,730
If I'm not pushy, they'll fall under my control...

70
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,720
I wish!

71
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,080
Kakeru, wanna come to my place?

72
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,340
Excuse me!

73
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,710
Doda!

74
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,200
What an asshole!

75
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,120
Doda! Hey, wait for me, Shuichiro!

76
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,530
She even calls him by his first name, "Shuichiro", and you know what that means...

77
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,400
Man, screw him! Screw Doda! He's got his hands on Hiromi already!

78
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,730
It's not just a hobby anymore. He can beat the pros now.

79
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,460
If you want, you can have some of these.

80
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,420
Want some coffee, Kakeru?

81
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,510
Sure, thanks.

82
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,200
No way! He must like Mika...

83
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,860
He found out!

84
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,730
Mr. Big Brother!

85
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,060
Mr. Big Brother, please!

86
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,170
Get away from me!

87
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,410
Mr. Big Brother, please give me your approval to go out with her.

88
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,870
You! She's my little sister!

89
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,050
Idiot...

90
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,720
Coming!

91
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,430
Oh, Urara.

92
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,180
Good evening, Mika invited me to spend the night with her.

93
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,510
I'm pleased to be here.

94
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,430
Mika! Urara is here.

95
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,260
Well, let her in.

96
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,100
Thank you for having me over!

97
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,390
Let's take a bath together before dinner.

98
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,930
I brought some extra clothes.

99
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,180
You have a great body.

100
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,770
Thank you, so do you.

101
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,390
Thanks, but I could stand to lose a few pounds.

102
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,770
I won't get horny over my sister's body.

103
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,860
Let me wash your back.

104
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,770
Thanks!

105
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,130
Mika, you're in the way! I can't see!

106
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,560
It's so hot! I'll open the window.

107
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,260
Ah, it feels so good.

108
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,270
Hello...

109
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,260
Hiroma? This is a surprise.

110
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,270
Nanahoshi, can you come out now?

111
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,680
So, what's up Hiromi?

112
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,860
I know that you've liked me for a long time, Nanahoshi.

113
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,840
I've felt it...

114
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,280
What are you saying?

115
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,330
You can do whatever you want with me now.

116
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,040
What? Oh, yeah!

117
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,340
Hiromi...

118
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,680
What are we doing here?

119
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,690
Hey, Hiromi!

120
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,900
I like you too, you know, Nanahoshi.

121
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,510
But don't you think this is a just a bit sudden?

122
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,190
You know...

123
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,560
...girls don't function as smoothy as boys...

124
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,980
...when we have to operate our heads and bodies simultaneously.

125
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,450
But...

126
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,670
Her body that I've dreamt about...

127
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,270
...is right here in front of me.

128
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,250
Are you sure about this?

129
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,640
This is like the dream chance of my senior year.

130
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,630
Hiromi...

131
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,610
Oh, Shuichiro!

132
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,240
Ah! Right there!

133
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,760
You're making me crazy!

134
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,870
Shuichiro!

135
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,310
Nanahoshi?

136
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,180
You just got dumped by Doda, didn't you?

137
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,220
You're trying to forget him by sleeping with me, aren't you?

138
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,690
Sorry, I can't do that.

139
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,850
I won't take you on the rebound.

140
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,670
I'm so sorry!

141
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,360
Come on! This isn't the Hiromi I know!

142
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,960
You'll forget all about him by tomorrow.

143
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,720
Trust me.

144
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,350
Maybe I shouldn't have been so conscientious.

145
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,740
It was my first real chance and it would've been with Hiromi!

146
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,100
Urara...

147
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,790
Nope, I was right!

148
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,750
Uncorrupted, innocent Urara!

149
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,200
She should be my first!

150
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,410
Doda!

151
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,960
Nanahoshi?!

152
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,310
Don't even think about it with this girl!

153
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,270
Don't get your panties in a wad!

154
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,940
I'm just trying to recruit her into my club.

155
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,970
He's telling the truth.

156
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,180
Then keep your hands off her!

157
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,150
Are you jealous?

158
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,340
Big Brother, please don't!

159
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,150
See ya later, losers!

160
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,920
Listen, that guy is a snake!

161
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,280
Okay, but why...

162
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,360
Why are you so worried about me?

163
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,160
Because...

164
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,720
...you're my little sister's friend and...

165
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,860
...I mean...

166
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,770
...I think of you as my own sister!

167
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,080
What?

168
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,460
So pretty!

169
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,190
Look!

170
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,560
Boy! She is sooo cute!

171
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,570
Kakeru!

172
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,000
You're late, Takeshi!

173
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,530
Never mind that!

174
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,660
Mika went to the dirty lingerie resale shop!

175
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,380
What?!

176
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,980
Hey! There she is! There!

177
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,390
Urara-chan?

178
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,100
Oh! Mika's big brother!

179
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,400
Where's Mika?!

180
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,930
Oh, she just left.

181
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,030
Mika!

182
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,330
Takeshi must really like her...

183
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,320
Oh yeah!

184
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,870
Come with me!

185
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,170
Ouch! What's the matter?

186
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,730
Your curiosity will lead you down the wrong road! You understand?!

187
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,350
We just went in there to turn them down!

188
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,910
What? Turn them down?

189
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,560
You thought we were cooperating with them?

190
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,830
I can't believe it...

191
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,320
We just went in there to tell them not to follow us around...

192
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,470
...because a friend at my previous school kept bugging us to join them!

193
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,020
I'm sorry, I thought you were...

194
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,170
But I'm glad you're worrying abouth me so much.

195
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,050
Urara...

196
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,050
Yes! Now Urara and I have bonded!

197
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,220
I guess I should stop ridiculing Takeshi.

198
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,250
Coming!

199
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,490
Good afternoon!

200
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,560
Oh, hi!

201
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,180
I'm supposed to study with Mika today.

202
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,500
The sky looks kinda weird, doesn't it?

203
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,730
Please come in.

204
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,240
Mika went to my aunt and uncle's place with my mom.

205
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,900
They should be back any time now.

206
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,850
Okay!

207
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,920
The forecast for the Kanto area is sunny, turning partly cloudy.

208
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,800
There's a 30 percent chance of rain.

209
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,670
They're running late.

210
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,370
The phone!

211
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,790
Hello, Nanahoshi residence.

212
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,700
Oh, Mika, Urara's here now.

213
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,670
Here, let me get her...

214
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,160
Hello...

215
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,980
Hi, Urara. I'm so sorry.

216
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,010
There's a gale wind in this area and the trains aren't running.

217
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,850
My uncle insists we stay here.

218
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,360
I'm sorry Urara, we'll have to cancel our session.

219
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,290
That's okay.

220
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,590
There's a spring storm here. How about there?

221
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,530
It's not too bad, but...

222
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,380
We should stay inside untill the wind dies down.

223
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,430
Right!

224
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,340
Oh shit!

225
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,210
Sorry! I took your picture without asking you!

226
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,630
Urara...

227
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,740
I've had a crush on you ever since...

228
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,410
I saw you at the commencement.

229
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,500
I really like you!

230
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,470
What'll I do now?!

231
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,060
This situation wasn't covered in any of the manuals or videos!

232
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,600
Ouch!

233
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:30,980
Sorry!

234
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,750
Please be gentle with me.

235
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,080
Urara...

236
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,660
This is my first time...

237
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,910
But it'll be okay since it's with you.

238
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,290
What do I do next?

239
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,040
I've watched a lot of pronos and read a lot of magazines but...

240
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,720
I feel like I've been swept away!

241
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,190
According to those pornos, I should...

242
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,100
Don't look at me.

243
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,460
It's okay! It'll be okay!

244
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,900
You're driving me crazy!

245
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,430
Nooo!

246
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,320
Sorry!

247
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,400
No, it's okay.

248
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,210
But please don't hurt me.

249
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,760
It's okay! It'll be okay!

250
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,870
No! Don't look!

251
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,430
Please don't stare at it!

252
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,750
Oh, sorry...

253
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,820
That feels great!

254
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,020
Here I come...

255
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,430
Ouch! That's not he right place!

256
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,090
Sorry, this was my first time, too.

257
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,710
I'm happy... I'm very happy.

258
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,500
Urara...

259
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,350
No regrets, okay?

260
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,120
What's wrong?

261
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,620
No way! It's back already?!

262
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,350
That's a quick comeback!

263
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,600
Let's try again, Urara.

264
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,370
Let's try again.

265
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,150
This time I'lll...

266
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,390
Urara...

267
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,340
I'm scared!

268
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,960
It hurts!

269
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,080
Urara!

270
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,010
I'm so happy... I've got no regrets.

271
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,730
Good morning!

272
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,460
Oh, good morning!

273
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,490
Big Brother...

274
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,670
When I daydream while looking at the enternal flame...

275
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:51,540
I feel the whispering of wind...

276
00:25:51,550 --> 00:26:00,890
The reflection of your smile in my eye is so dazzling...

277
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,520
Shining seasons come and go.

278
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,270
Times overlap again and again.

279
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,980
Loving each other...

280
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,940
Hurting each other...

281
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,620
As we slowly become adults.

282
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,160
I'll never forget...

283
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:30,870
Those precious moments.

284
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,210
I'll look at you from so far away,

285
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:41,140
Just as I did in those days.

286
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:19,040
You're smiling at me in my fading memory.

287
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:28,390
I still remember that innocent promise...

288
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:38,770
When I finally met you after so many days and nights.

289
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:53,540
I wanted to hold onto you forever...

290
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:59,300
From those days...
