1
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,800
<i>Yusuke.</i>

2
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:31,242
Hi, Reika.

3
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,985
My fault.

4
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,759
Are you all right?

5
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,443
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

6
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:13,821
I'm so glad you're okay, Shoko.

7
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,526
But you have to be careful.

8
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:20,126
I broke so many plates.

9
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:31,564
No more crying. You have work to do.

10
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,845
Okay?

11
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,685
- Yusuke.
- Yes?

12
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:46,053
I'd like Shoko to change her clothes.

13
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:50,087
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,490
How's Shoko?

15
00:02:58,036 --> 00:03:00,163
She's in good hands.

16
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:02,595
Reika.

17
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,242
KINOSHITA

18
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,312
What do you think, Yusuke, Rumi?

19
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:18,150
The new Pia Carrot uniform.

20
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,648
Not bad.

21
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,227
Would you move?

22
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:29,464
If you don't understand fashion,
no girl will fall for you.

23
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:36,129
Dad, if that's all you do,
no woman will fall for you.

24
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,578
That's my affair, stay out of it.

25
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:53,448
Always trying to sound so strong.

26
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,118
Don't make fun of your father.

27
00:04:00,732 --> 00:04:03,098
<i>- Michiko.
- Yoshio.</i>

28
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:06,063
<i>Michiko.</i>

29
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,032
<i>Reika.</i>

30
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,514
<i>What's with you, Reika?</i>

31
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,857
<i>Our boss is not a bad designer after all.</i>

32
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,328
Let's get to work, Shoko.

33
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:36,095
Right, Shoko?

34
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:45,400
- Shoko?
- Satomi.

35
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,205
I see. It's Yusuke, isn't it?

36
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:10,990
I've got it. Let me handle it.

37
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:14,136
Okay.

38
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,134
I'll do my best.

39
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:25,109
Welcome to Pia Carrot.

40
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:36,386
Hey, Yusuke. I'm talking to you.

41
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,793
What are you staring at?

42
00:05:39,897 --> 00:05:43,230
Nothing. What do you want?

43
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,028
Yeah. Are you busy tonight?

44
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:53,970
I've got nothing to do.

45
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:57,643
Then come to karaoke
with Shoko and me.

46
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:01,917
Well. Why not? Just this once.

47
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,112
It's a date. Happy, Shoko?

48
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,519
I'm excited.

49
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:15,663
Getting there.

50
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:21,134
<i>I guess Satomi can be
surprisingly feminine.</i>

51
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:24,238
Hey!

52
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:26,941
Cute. Hey, Kitty.

53
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:29,375
Good timing.

54
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:36,548
Too much spice, maybe?

55
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:42,091
Weird. What if I toss in this...

56
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:55,071
Oops!

57
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:01,936
I just remembered.
I'm busy tonight, I gotta go.

58
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,115
What? Some other time, then.

59
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,878
You don't want to go with me?

60
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:23,224
Okay, okay. Just for an hour, okay?

61
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,496
- Yeah!
- That's my Yusuke.

62
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,506
- Good night.
- Good night.

63
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,203
Reika...

64
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,072
Good night!

65
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,646
Go on, go on.

66
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,966
About time now.

67
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:39,432
She's doing good.

68
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:45,647
Huh?

69
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:01,425
What?

70
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,032
Here.

71
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:12,403
Shoko. This is not a Karaoke place.

72
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:16,178
Come on, Yusuke.

73
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:19,542
This is a hotel.

74
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:23,109
See you tomorrow.

75
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:29,382
I made up my mind.

76
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,219
I want you tonight.

77
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,257
Shoko.

78
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:50,537
No way.

79
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,207
They must be kidding.

80
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,517
Shoko.

81
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:31,948
Shoko, Shoko.

82
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,914
You can't do that.

83
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:40,459
My palm bra.

84
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:47,333
No, Yusuke, this wasn't in the books.

85
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:51,668
I'm sorry.

86
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,306
This is my first time, so please be gentle.

87
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:15,297
Men.

88
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,530
I hate men!

89
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:24,131
Yusuke, I'm so happy.

90
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,268
I've been waiting for this.

91
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:30,172
Are you sure, Shoko?

92
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:34,243
Shoko?

93
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,151
Shoko. Shoko.

94
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,664
I love you, Yusuke.

95
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,262
Oh, well.

96
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:15,381
Yusuke, I was so happy last night.

97
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,656
I'll see you at the restaurant.

98
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,662
See you later.

99
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:30,601
You can't flirt with other girls.

100
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,985
No. I've had enough.

101
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:47,849
That sounds like...

102
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:52,362
- Lovers' fight.
- So early in the morning.

103
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,289
<i>Shiho.</i>

104
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:02,063
I'm tired. Let me think about it.

105
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,803
This is heavy.

106
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:43,712
Why are you depressed, Mr. Casanova?

107
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:47,615
- It's nothing.
- Oh, good.

108
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:52,248
There you are. Let's go home.

109
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:56,658
You don't have to cling to me so much.

110
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,490
Don't be shy.

111
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:04,395
We've been skin to skin, haven't we?

112
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,170
<i>Help.</i>

113
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:12,337
You're too much.

114
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:16,472
I'm home.

115
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:22,951
- I'm exhausted.
- No. Don't say that.

116
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,144
Please don't leave.

117
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,557
<i>What, Rumi, too?</i>

118
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,285
I'm sorry. Talk to you later.

119
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:36,757
Bro, don't sneak up on me.

120
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:41,604
What, you just weren't paying attention.

121
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,101
Someone dump you? No wonder.

122
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:50,111
Huh, I'm not like you.

123
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:52,711
Is Dad home?

124
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,544
Don't go in there now.

125
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,761
Wrong. Wrong.

126
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:12,197
Wrong, wrong.

127
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,800
What's going on?

128
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:25,206
You're working hard.

129
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,473
Yusuke.

130
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,522
It's about Shiho.

131
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,717
She's leaving us.

132
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:42,696
I'm sorry. Family emergency.

133
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:03,876
<i>What's wrong with everybody?</i>

134
00:16:08,058 --> 00:16:11,494
<i>There's something weird
going on at Pia Carrot these days.</i>

135
00:16:20,237 --> 00:16:21,727
Reika.

136
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,067
Stay away!

137
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:30,571
Stay away, and listen.

138
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:34,349
I was dating someone.

139
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:37,916
He dumped me.

140
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:41,657
I was so lonely.

141
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:45,192
Then I saw you.

142
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,696
I tried to fall in love with you.

143
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:58,664
Reika.

144
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,877
I'm sorry. But I couldn't.

145
00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:05,841
I'm sorry.

146
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,885
I'm really sorry.

147
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,663
We're getting wet.

148
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:04,897
Yusuke?

149
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,738
What're you doing out at this hour?

150
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,746
You're soaked. You'll catch cold.

151
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,046
Come on.

152
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:37,696
I see. Today was Reika's last day.

153
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:41,934
Did you forgive her, Yusuke?

154
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,570
It's beyond that.

155
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:47,248
There was nothing I could do.

156
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:50,286
Poor girl. Well.

157
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:55,115
I'm in the same boat.

158
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:08,400
Cheer up. Tears don't become you.

159
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,603
You're leaving us, too.

160
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,640
Yes.

161
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:18,614
I have to. I'm not getting any younger.

162
00:19:19,216 --> 00:19:22,982
- Things are happening with my family, too.
- No.

163
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:26,078
Yusuke.

164
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:31,794
Please, Shiho. Don't quit Pia Carrot.

165
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:37,325
Reika is gone,
Dad and Satomi are acting weird...

166
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:40,094
...now you're leaving.

167
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:43,165
Shiho.

168
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,108
Don't go. Please. Stay.

169
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:56,817
Shiho, Shiho.

170
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,509
Are you all right?

171
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:33,119
I'm all right.

172
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:45,333
Good, Yusuke, you're good.

173
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:01,444
Wait. No, not there.

174
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,712
No. Don't look. Please.

175
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:11,750
- You're embarrassing me.
- You're beautiful, Shiho.

176
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,968
Yusuke. It's so nice, Yusuke.

177
00:21:34,818 --> 00:21:36,581
Shiho, I...

178
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:39,684
Hold on. Come with me.

179
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,941
Yusuke.

180
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,945
Yusuke.

181
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:14,547
Bro.

182
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:17,650
Satomi and Shoko are here.

183
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:19,887
Why?

184
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:25,621
I invited them. It's a big lunch party.

185
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:27,719
Party?

186
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:33,697
- Hey, Yusuke.
- I'm here, Yusuke.

187
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,637
Go have fun. I'm busy.

188
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,401
We'll cook our best.
Please come join us later.

189
00:23:41,978 --> 00:23:44,970
I'll bring him down when you're ready.

190
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,641
Go cook.

191
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:57,258
I'll ask you to join us later.

192
00:23:57,327 --> 00:23:59,955
I'll help you, Shoko.

193
00:24:01,464 --> 00:24:05,332
- Thank you, Rumi.
- Let's go.

194
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:08,128
They're so feisty.

195
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:11,872
Shoko practiced cooking for you.

196
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,587
She's so earnest.
You have to be nice to her.

197
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,022
Aren't you joining them?

198
00:24:29,893 --> 00:24:34,796
- Do you want me to cook for you?
- Kind of scary.

199
00:24:46,676 --> 00:24:50,942
- What do you mean?
- You're choking me!

200
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:55,541
<i>- What is this?
- I don't believe it.</i>

201
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,645
<i>- What're we going to do?
- What're we going to do?</i>

202
00:24:58,722 --> 00:25:01,020
- What is this?
- Help.

203
00:25:19,342 --> 00:25:21,537
Satomi's feast. Great.

204
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:25,303
Looks so yummy.

205
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:32,078
What's wrong? You're not eating?

206
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,251
I...

207
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,725
- It's so good.
- Isn't it?

208
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:44,298
Really. Satomi, it's so delicious.

209
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:45,891
It is, isn't it?

210
00:25:46,102 --> 00:25:47,865
<i>It can't be.</i>

211
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,437
Delicious. It's seriously good.

212
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,606
It is, isn't it?

213
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:05,447
I was pretty sure.

214
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:10,622
It's so good.

215
