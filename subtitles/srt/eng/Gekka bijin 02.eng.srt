1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,830
Preparing for my next attempt
at the college entrance exams,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,500
I'd come to the Kazahana Inn
to finalize my studies.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,440
But, before I knew it,
I was doing this...

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,980
and that...

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,380
...and all kinds of things.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,780
At last, I ended up marrying Miyuki,
the apartment manager.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,720
This all began because
I'd trained my stepmother, Rin.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,520
I'm a bondage master, you see.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,330
The path of a dominator
is a slippery slope.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,530
And, to become
a true bondage master,

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,190
I had a lot more
studying to do.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:45,140
Maison Plaisir
The Queen of the Night: Part II

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,250
You want this now?

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,900
If you do, tell me.

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,530
Just letting it drip down
like this is bad manners.

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,570
Master Seiichi... Please put
your treasure inside of me now!

17
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,980
Like this?

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,290
Master Seiichi!

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,480
Quick Study Guide
for Final Exams

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,920
Dictionary for
Chinese Characters

21
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,490
How does it feel?

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
Tell me how it feels,
using 20 characters.

23
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,700
You hurt me when you do it!

24
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,610
Master Seiichi!

25
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,370
You hurt me when you do it!

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,990
That's exactly 20 characters!

27
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,220
Night after night...

28
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,290
I can't take it anymore!

29
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,130
How can I study
with all this noise?

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,100
For God's sake,
those two...

31
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,370
I just wish they'd
cut it out for once!

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,580
If I don't talk
to them about it,

33
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,410
I'll go out of my mind!

34
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,660
Master Seiichi, you bully...

35
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,180
Oh, yes...
I mean, this sucks!

36
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,720
It's okay for me,
I guess.

37
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,040
Here I cum!

38
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,490
Master Seiichi...

39
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,430
Study... Gotta... study...

40
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,760
I'm falling behind.

41
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,310
Okay, let's begin
our New Year's talent show!

42
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,870
Okay, what sort of stunt
do you have for us today?

43
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,610
Miyuki, more, please.

44
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,240
Sure thing.

45
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,220
...looking forward to it.
This is your host, John Birabira.

46
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,380
And I'm Hanami.
Pleased to meet you!

47
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,640
Yes, pleased to meet you.

48
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,740
Hee-ya!

49
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,650
Hi, man!
How're you doing?

50
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,660
M- Mr. Haga...?

51
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,020
Good evening.

52
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,030
M- Miyuki! What a surprise!

53
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,860
Big surprise...

54
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,210
You asshole!

55
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,830
See you later, man!

56
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,380
What are you trying to do?

57
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,680
What do you mean?

58
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,410
My ass! My anus!

59
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,820
Um, I mean...
Exams! The exams!

60
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,520
You haven't studied at all,
have you?

61
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,230
Um, I have studied
a bit, but...

62
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,400
Not a bit at night, right?

63
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
I can hear you
clearly enough!

64
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,370
Well... Yeah.

65
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,570
Miyuki, you have to crack
the whip on him a little!

66
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,510
He's gonna
fail his exams again!

67
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,910
Right, but we were
studying grammar before.

68
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,750
20-character sentences.

69
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,420
Jeez! We're just gonna
have to separate you two!

70
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,890
Oh? Do we have a visitor?

71
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,480
I'll go check.

72
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,690
Sheesh! No one cares
what happens to my ass.

73
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,160
What did you say?

74
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,830
Nothing!

75
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,970
Seiichi?

76
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,340
What is it?

77
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,370
Seiichi, you have a visitor.

78
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,000
I do?

79
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,940
Hi, Big Brother!

80
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,450
Kiriko!

81
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,650
- I'm here!
- But why? I thought Rin...

82
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,950
I mean, I thought Mom
forbade you to come here!

83
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,120
Yeah... I guess.

84
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,950
What do you mean,
you guess?

85
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,230
Anyway, come to my room,
so we can talk.

86
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,860
Ow! That hurts!
Big Brother, you're hurting me!

87
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,760
Shut up and come on!

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,930
Hey!

89
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,430
Dammit! Don't they
care about my ass?

90
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,970
This is my sister,
Kiriko ltoh.

91
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,150
My sister,
but not by blood.

92
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,540
Still, we were raised together
after the separation,

93
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,850
and I feel like I'm
really her brother.

94
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,450
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is the first time we've met.

95
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,920
That's right!

96
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,690
It's nice to meet you,
Big Sister Miyuki!

97
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,570
I'm Kiriko,
Seiichi's little sister.

98
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,660
It's a pleasure
meeting with you finally.

99
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,230
Wait, are they
sisters-in-law, now?

100
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,680
Man, we have so many steps
and in-laws in this family.

101
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,010
Well, it's not like it matters.

102
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,210
So, what's the story, Kiriko,

103
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,380
showing up here like this?
Did something happen?

104
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,220
I am never, ever
going home again!

105
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,950
You had a fight?

106
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,560
Lots of them! I just can't live
with Mom and Dad anymore!

107
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,570
That's why I didn't
come to your wedding!

108
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,630
Whoa, whoa!
Don't get us involved...

109
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,660
in some stupid argument
with our parents.

110
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,730
What are you saying?

111
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,900
You're the cause of it!

112
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,030
I'm the cause?

113
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,680
Um, why don't I
make some tea?

114
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,350
Okay, you've got me.

115
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,380
You mind telling me
what this is about?

116
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,450
Look, Big Brother...

117
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,860
I... saw it all.

118
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,560
Saw what?

119
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,130
What you and... she... did.

120
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,300
I saw it!

121
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:09,210
I was so shocked to see
you taking her like that!

122
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,480
Because I love you,
Big Brother!

123
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,520
Kiriko, what are you...

124
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,660
I'm able to do this
for you, Seiichi!

125
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,230
Please... do to me
what you did to her!

126
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,200
I'll do anything you want!

127
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,040
I just want
to make you happy!

128
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,540
Is that how it is?
Well, I don't mind.

129
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,680
A halfhearted training
is hell for a woman.

130
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,380
I think it'd be best
if you handled this.

131
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,150
Hm... I appreciate
you saying that, but...

132
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,030
But the truth was,
I had mixed feelings about it.

133
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,960
Rin and Kiriko.
They both saw me as a man.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,330
And there was
a reason for that.

135
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,440
Big Brother...

136
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,740
The truth is,
they aren't related by blood.

137
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,540
Kiriko was Rin's former husband's
daughter from a previous marriage.

138
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,210
After his death,
Rin adopted her.

139
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,820
If I trained Kiriko,
what about Rin?

140
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,780
They may be mother and daughter,
but they're both women.

141
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,200
It may sound strange, but lately,
they've become rivals.

142
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,320
Here... I want Big Brother
inside of me here!

143
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,140
In here!

144
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,670
We might not be related by blood,
but I still thought of her...

145
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,140
as my darling sister.

146
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,910
Should I open up
the path of bondage to her?

147
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,080
It's a path from which
you cannot turn back.

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,500
Hello, ltoh residence.

149
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,070
Seiichi? Have you seen Kiriko,
by any chance?

150
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,840
Yeah.

151
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,780
For now, there's an empty
apartment we can let her stay in.

152
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,220
Oh, that woman's hopeless.

153
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,690
Tell her to come home
in a few days.

154
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,250
And Seiichi...

155
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,660
Don't train her. All right?

156
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,890
You understand?

157
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,700
That'll be up to Kiriko.

158
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,230
No one can stop her.

159
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,110
No! No! Absolutely not!

160
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,670
You'd train your own sister?

161
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,210
The same would apply
to you, Rin.

162
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,590
You're jealous of her,
aren't you?

163
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,850
Seiichi!

164
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,190
In any case, I'll tell her
to come home as soon as possible.

165
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,560
Goodbye.

166
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,460
Seiichi!

167
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,870
I heard it all from Rin.

168
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,170
First the mother,
now the sister.

169
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,450
Your karma is deep
and twisted, my friend.

170
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,810
You don't have to say it
like that, Master!

171
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,550
Then why are you hesitating?

172
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,620
It's Rin.

173
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,020
What? Don't like eating
the egg with the chicken?

174
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,050
Stop talking like that!

175
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,160
It's not unreasonable
for Rin to try and stop you.

176
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,390
She is a woman, after all.

177
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,190
She's jealous of Kiriko!

178
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,060
As I thought.

179
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,470
Seiichi...

180
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,500
A true bondage master
can use ordinary jealousy...

181
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,610
as a tool to throw
the heart into chaos!

182
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,840
It is the definitive battle
between man and woman!

183
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,190
If you are ready to risk
your very life, then go for it!

184
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,720
Go! Go now, Seiichi!

185
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,290
I've decided! I'll do it!

186
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,230
Kiriko is a woman!

187
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,330
And it is my destiny
to train women!

188
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,400
So, I'll do it!

189
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,310
I feel sorta embarrassed.

190
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,350
There's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

191
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,380
They've grown so big.

192
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,860
And so lovely, too.

193
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,050
Nicely firm.

194
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,600
Let me get a good look at you.

195
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,470
This is so embarrassing!

196
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,680
Kiriko! If you're not up for this,
I won't do it!

197
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,910
Sorry.

198
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,780
All right.

199
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,050
Go lie down.

200
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,310
Let's get a better look at you.

201
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,190
Hm, you've been busy
down here, all right.

202
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,820
It's really red.

203
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,700
That's not true!
I haven't used it at all!

204
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,670
You're the first guy
who's ever seen it.

205
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,570
I'm the first?

206
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,040
I'm glad, Kiriko.

207
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,580
You're licking me.

208
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,710
Big Brother,
you're licking my cunt!

209
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,420
Kiriko, here I go.

210
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,890
Okay.

211
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,070
Big Brother is inside of me.

212
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,200
It hurts! It hurts, but...

213
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,670
But I'm happy!

214
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,050
It feels so good!
I feel so good!

215
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,220
That's the way, Kiriko.

216
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,020
Nice and tight.

217
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,760
Make it tighter for me.

218
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,260
You mean... like this?

219
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,730
Yeah... That's the way.

220
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,520
I'm going to cum!

221
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,500
I'm going to cum too,
Big Brother!

222
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,790
Here it comes!

223
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,640
It tastes like you, Big Brother.

224
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,560
So, what's up, Kasumi?

225
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,380
Oh, Nagi!

226
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,120
Hi there.

227
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,890
So, you're all finished studying?

228
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,120
About that...

229
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,320
Yeah...

230
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,300
Seiichi's doing it
with his sister now!

231
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,670
Kiriko, huh?

232
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,900
There are lines
you just shouldn't cross!

233
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,840
Wow. Way to go, Seiichi.

234
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,450
Honestly, the noise Miyuki makes
is bad enough!

235
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,780
Now it's gonna be
twice as loud!

236
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,380
Oh, God, I really can't
take it anymore!

237
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,710
What if you joined in?

238
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,620
Me? Oh, come on, Nagi!

239
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,090
You wanna see my ass
that badly?

240
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,250
Huh?

241
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,750
Okay, time to piss.

242
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,770
Ow! It hurts!

243
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,150
Big Brother, this hurts!

244
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,980
Ow! Ow! Stop it!

245
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,650
Hey! Be quiet!

246
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,720
It only hurts at first!

247
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,460
Rin was like this at first, too!

248
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,960
You did this to her, too?

249
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,330
Of course.
She did it gladly.

250
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,440
Then I'll do it! Do it again!

251
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,740
Come on.
Don't forget about this.

252
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,790
Go on.
You can let it out now.

253
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,900
Good, Kiriko. Well done.

254
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,030
You did a good job!

255
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,480
Um, Miyuki...
Are you sure this is okay?

256
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,420
What, is the rice burned?

257
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,420
No, not that! I mean the situation
with Seiichi and Kiriko!

258
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,890
They really get along well.

259
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,460
Not that!
You're really okay with this?

260
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,630
Having your husband
screwing another woman!

261
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,100
Kasumi...

262
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,010
Hm? What?

263
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,570
I trust Seiichi.

264
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,550
And so I don't waver,
in my body or my heart.

265
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,750
Seiichi, what's happening
with Kiriko?

266
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,980
Did you and Kiriko honestly...

267
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,660
I told you before, didn't I?

268
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,660
No, don't!
It's too much for her!

269
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,690
I am not gonna
let you beat me!

270
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,130
Kiriko's training
went unexpectedly well.

271
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,870
I imagine it was due
to her rivalry with Rin.

272
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,480
But, while it was
going smoothly,

273
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,820
I was trapped between
mother and daughter.

274
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,950
I couldn't favor
one over the other,

275
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,650
and in my heart I prayed
that they would make up.

276
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,320
Yes?

277
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,390
Seiichi, we've got trouble!

278
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,600
No way! I'm not going home!

279
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,870
Bleaugh!

280
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,740
Oh, you pain in the neck!

281
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,680
I'll drag you home
if I have to!

282
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,820
Go to it!

283
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,580
Hiya, man!

284
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,590
C- Councilman!

285
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,110
I want you
to hand over that lady.

286
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,390
Why are you doing this,
Councilman?

287
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,330
Well, I heard someone
was disturbing the peace.

288
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,270
Please obey your mother,
and release your sister now,

289
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,640
and I won't have to hurt you.

290
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,530
Big Brother!

291
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,140
Forget it! I'm not
handing her over to you!

292
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,140
Come on, man!
Be reasonable and give her to us!

293
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,610
No way!

294
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,240
- Release her!
- I said no!

295
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,610
Release her at once!

296
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,980
Then I'll do it by force!

297
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,520
Who did that?

298
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,220
Only a fool doesn't know
how to mind his own business!

299
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,460
Begone with you!

300
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,620
That voice!

301
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,060
It's Sohun!

302
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,660
Sohun Chinen!

303
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,630
You dare meddle in this?

304
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,640
I know what I'm doing!

305
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,110
Away with you!

306
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,080
I was just doing her a favor!

307
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,280
But if you're
challenging me, I accept!

308
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,950
Hee-yaa!

309
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,410
Simpleminded fool!

310
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,320
- Seiichi!
- Big Brother!

311
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,400
Both of you, come up here!

312
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,320
Sorry, Miyuki.
Could you stay here?

313
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,640
This is your punishment
for not getting along!

314
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,140
Each one of you gets half!

315
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,350
See? He felt so good at having me
lick first that he closed his eyes!

316
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,360
No, it's because
I was sucking on his balls!

317
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,180
Oh, like that would
ever get him off!

318
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,390
Kiriko, out of my way!

319
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,950
What a racket.

320
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,040
Um, maybe I should
turn on the TV.

321
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,870
- No, thank you! More, please!
- No, thank you! More, please!

322
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,240
Eat that much
and you'll get fat!

323
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,230
I'm still growing!

324
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,740
I'm not an old lady,
like you!

325
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,370
What was that?

326
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,470
Well, it's true, isn't it?

327
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,210
Would you two cut it out?

328
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,390
So, how are things
with Rin and Kiriko?

329
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,930
Nothing I try
seems to do any good.

330
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,030
They're both too stubborn!

331
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,730
Rin is so wild at heart!

332
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,540
And Kiriko's a grown woman.

333
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,410
It must irritate her.

334
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,970
Just dealing with one of them
is hard enough.

335
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,780
I can't handle both of them
at the same time.

336
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,580
What should I do?

337
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,110
Fool!

338
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,150
Did you not have the answer
from the very start?

339
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,190
You must forcibly heal
their estrangement by yourself!

340
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,560
There's no way!

341
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,220
There is one thing we can try
with them together.

342
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,390
Grilled Hot
octopus stew

343
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,860
Come on, it's New Year's.
You can smile, at least.

344
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,930
I am smiling!

345
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,960
Because I'm visiting the temple
with you, Big Brother!

346
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,900
Isn't Miyuki coming?

347
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,070
She'll be waiting for us later.

348
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,870
Let's go and pay
our respects.

349
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,470
Anybody home?

350
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,010
Sohun?

351
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,590
That's strange.
Must be out for New Year's.

352
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,530
Okay, let's have our first session
of the new year!

353
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Strip down, both of you!

354
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,270
What, in here?

355
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,840
Seiichi, start with me!

356
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,470
No, with me!

357
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,070
Whoa, whoa!
Both of you, together!

358
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,920
You have to do each other!

359
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,510
"Do each other"?

360
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,910
You want me to fuck her?

361
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,820
- Forget it!
- Forget it!

362
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,990
God, you two are
really stubborn women!

363
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,950
Hey! Miyuki!

364
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,360
Miyuki?

365
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,030
M- Miyuki, what is this?

366
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,900
Happy New Year, Mother.

367
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,270
Mother, I'd like you
to use this.

368
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,020
No, I'm not ready!
It's too soon!

369
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,710
But, Mother,
look how wet you are.

370
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,210
I'm getting to fuck
Seiichi's own mother!

371
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,250
It's in my ass!
I'm getting it from both ends!

372
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,520
I feel them both
hitting inside of me!

373
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,820
Okay, Miyuki. Let's do it.

374
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,630
Right.

375
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,360
Kiriko?

376
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,270
Now it's your turn.

377
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,110
How does it feel, Kiriko?

378
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,890
It feels so weird!

379
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,160
It feels real good!

380
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,370
Miyuki, switch places.

381
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,200
Okay.

382
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,310
Ready?
Lower your crotch slowly.

383
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,640
No! I don't want
to fuck my mom!

384
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,670
Kiriko! Your body is
so developed now!

385
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,010
You really are a woman.

386
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,370
And Mom, your body
is so soft! It feels so good!

387
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,790
Mom, forgive me!

388
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,160
I've been so bad!

389
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,490
It's all right, Kiriko.

390
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,970
I was just jealous of you
because you're in your prime.

391
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,630
All right!
Well done, both of you!

392
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,940
And now, your reward!

393
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,770
And a bonus!

394
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,600
See? Get them
to touch flesh to flesh,

395
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,330
and it loosens their hearts.

396
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,700
Well done, Master Seiichi!

397
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,950
No, it wouldn't have worked
without your help.

398
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,270
Thank you.

399
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,750
Okay, let's get some
real bondage action going here!

400
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,080
Oh, Master Seiichi...

401
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,950
I love you so much.

402
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,180
And so, it all ended well.

403
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,220
As a bondage master,
I was able to repair...

404
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,490
the relationship
between mother and daughter.

405
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,760
With this endeavor ended,

406
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,890
I look forward
to future challenges!

407
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,140
Cold love...

408
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,810
is staring you in the eye.

409
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,950
It affected the other...

410
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,850
person in the other direction.

411
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,750
Reciting an...

412
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,660
explosive memory.

413
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,900
Discovering love for the first time.

414
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,530
Angry, angry last girlfriend.

415
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:45,340
Look at the back of the nocturne.

416
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,550
It's the sort of time when it drifted...

417
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,850
lightly, lightly.

418
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:56,040
Out in the country...

419
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,690
Iove intended that one.

420
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:04,390
I could see from memory...

421
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,400
spreading out, spreading out.

422
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,300
I want to know...

423
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,940
someone very closely.
