1
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:15,115
I'm Lieutenant Kate Curtis of the
GaIaxy Union MiIitary Security Department.

2
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:17,520
CurrentIy undergoing an
internship for undercover duty.

3
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:20,557
Forget the formaI introduction.

4
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:26,287
I'm 19 years oId. My vitaI statistics
are 34-26-35, from top to bottom.

5
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:28,459
My weight is a secret.

6
00:03:29,302 --> 00:03:31,133
I have naturaI wavy red hair...

7
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:35,105
...and I was one of the sexiest
girIs in my cIass at the academy.

8
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:40,679
But that was just the
beginning of my tragedy.

9
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:46,814
Lieutenant Kate Curtis coming in, Sir.

10
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,531
What's with the dirty oId man?

11
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:14,205
I am Major Jones, the
commander of this mission.

12
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:17,514
I wiII brief you on the operation.

13
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,685
This is Doune, the
pIanet you wiII be stationed at.

14
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:26,018
It is one of those desoIate pIanets,
but IateIy there have been many...

15
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:31,153
...cases of young women
disappearing repeatedIy and reguIarIy.

16
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:34,662
Do you think it's an
organized crime case?

17
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,695
That's what I want you to find out.

18
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,372
Um, does this mean...

19
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:44,034
Ahem. Am I going
to go undercover, Sir?

20
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:48,312
The truth is, aII the victims
had three things in common...

21
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,076
...so the bait needs aII
those quaIities as weII.

22
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,819
First, she has to be very pretty.

23
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,382
SecondIy, she has to be buxom.

24
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,187
Yup, that's me aII right.

25
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:01,552
LastIy...

26
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,286
Yes?

27
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:04,887
She has to be an airheaded sIut.

28
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:05,793
Say what?

29
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:09,068
That's why we want you.

30
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:11,868
I wish you didn't...

31
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,796
Let me introduce
you to Lieutenant Smith.

32
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:21,337
He wiII be your
backup during this mission.

33
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,741
Lieutenant Curtis, Sir.

34
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:24,983
I'm Lieutenant Smith.

35
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:27,086
Lieutenant, show her the equipment.

36
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:31,747
Doune is mostIy desert.

37
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:34,884
You'II need this equipment.

38
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:37,596
Is it a heatproof suit?

39
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,101
Something Iike that. But the
suit won't be enough protection.

40
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:47,263
Don't forget to put on
this heatproof cream, too.

41
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,807
AII over my body?

42
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,035
That's right.

43
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:51,167
AII over.

44
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:52,633
AII over.

45
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,607
AII over down there, too.

46
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:55,337
AII over down there.

47
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:58,039
Don't get burned.

48
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:00,243
Don't get... huh?

49
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,646
This piece of
equipment contains a transmitter.

50
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:07,152
Isn't that a vibrator?

51
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:11,693
Put it in during the mission,
so you can send us a signaI.

52
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:15,297
It goes down there, too?

53
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:15,992
That's right.

54
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:18,061
Just kidding.

55
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:22,372
Don't joke around
with such a straight face.

56
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,708
The reaI transmitter is
buiIt into these earrings.

57
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,941
This is just something a sIut wouId use.

58
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:31,882
NaturaIIy, you may
keep it for your personaI use.

59
00:06:33,486 --> 00:06:35,010
No, thank you.

60
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:36,653
That's aII for now.

61
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:42,655
You wiII get dressed in the
station and foIIow the instructions.

62
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:44,863
Good Iuck.

63
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,329
Understood, Sir.

64
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:53,636
So here I am, trying to
Iook Iike an airheaded sIut.

65
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,737
What if they can't
rescue me before I get raped?

66
00:06:57,944 --> 00:06:58,876
I'm stiII a virgin!

67
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:07,816
Ladies and gentIemen, this
fIight wiII arrive in Bronve shortIy.

68
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:12,821
ETA is 10 AM Doune Standard Time.

69
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:17,689
Passengers transferring at
Doune, pIease go to gate number 3.

70
00:07:35,047 --> 00:07:41,976
Departing FIight 341 has now arrived.
The next departure wiII be at 10:30.

71
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,719
Shower room. Shower room.

72
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,558
My God. I onIy have
twenty minutes, I have to hurry.

73
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,399
What are these?
They're aII too sexy!

74
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,414
This one is better than the others.

75
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,942
That dirty oId man!

76
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,053
No!

77
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:20,752
This is Doune. You
know how this pIace is.

78
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:23,021
Let me give you something nice.

79
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,062
Stop!

80
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:37,033
Freeze! I'm a GaIaxy
PoIice Officer! Leave her aIone!

81
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:40,770
Shit!

82
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:42,279
I won't forget this!

83
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,951
Oh, that was so cIose!

84
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,283
Why did you get in my way?

85
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:53,255
You useIess bimbo!

86
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:56,886
You don't Iook famiIiar.

87
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,894
Are you reaIIy an officer?

88
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:05,395
Hey, move your foot! I'm an officer!

89
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,268
I'm from the GaIaxy PoIice Force!

90
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:10,432
Watch your mouth.

91
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,306
I'm a captain.

92
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:15,812
Do you want to repeat that after
me, Ms. Fresh-out-of-the-academy?

93
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:22,484
Captain, I'm sorry. But
wouId you pIease move your foot?

94
00:09:23,122 --> 00:09:24,851
Say, ''PIease, Captain, ma'am.''

95
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:30,118
PIease, Captain, ma'am.

96
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,666
That rapist was the
one I've been Iooking for.

97
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:39,095
I was so cIose to getting revenge.

98
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:41,202
You useIess bitch!

99
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,507
Watch your mouth next time.

100
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:49,772
I'm Doctor Eva. I work
at the GaIaxy MiIitary HospitaI.

101
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,978
If you ever get sent there,
I'II take good care of you.

102
00:09:56,656 --> 00:10:00,683
That hurts... I can't
beIieve she's a doctor.

103
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:04,460
She must be some
whore who wants to get raped!

104
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,690
That reaIIy hurt...

105
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:13,497
Hey!

106
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,014
Why do I have to dress Iike this?

107
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:32,080
I can be the bait without
wearing such embarrassing cIothes...

108
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,855
Miss, you're shaking.

109
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:37,689
Are you okay?

110
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,289
No, I'm fine.

111
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,431
Okay, I just wanted make sure.

112
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,593
By the way, are you on
vacation here at Doune?

113
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:48,333
Yes. It's my first time.

114
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,735
That's a coincidence. I am, too.

115
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,644
I feeI the hand of fate is at work.

116
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:56,938
How about it?

117
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:59,576
Why don't we spend our
vacation together under the sun?

118
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:02,413
Don't touch me!

119
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:11,426
You prudish bitch!

120
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,363
If I see you around, I'II get you!

121
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:27,940
The remaining time to
Tajimu airport is about one hour.

122
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:30,413
PIease enjoy our
promotionaI video untiI then.

123
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,285
I hate my first mission.

124
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:39,621
Oh, a informationaI tourist video.

125
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:41,751
What is that?

126
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:49,229
The wiId pIanet wiII rape you.

127
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:18,023
Once you get raped by a native,
you'II be burning with his passion!

128
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,131
If they run this video everyday,
it'II make the crime rate much worse!

129
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,433
AII those weird peopIe on this video...

130
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:29,508
No wonder this pIanet is so heIpIess!

131
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,335
I want to go home!

132
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:58,730
Oh, it's hot!

133
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,039
It's a Iot better than
the desert on Doune.

134
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,712
It's much worse over there.

135
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,943
Oh, is that so?

136
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:18,953
Hey, what are you Iooking at?

137
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:27,059
But, if I hide it, I won't Iook
Iike an airheaded sIut. Oh, weII.

138
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:32,734
Are you here for sightseeing?
I envy you, I'm here for a job.

139
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:36,499
I have to stay here
to make my saIes goaI.

140
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:38,743
That sounds so awfuI.

141
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:41,469
Let's go on a date sometime.

142
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:47,343
No, Kate, be patient. This is your duty.

143
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,265
I stiII feeI so embarrassed.

144
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:11,241
Can you hear me? It's Jones.

145
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:13,035
Yes. I can hear you, Sir.

146
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:15,511
Good. Listen carefuIIy...

147
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:18,879
Do you see the doors on your Ieft?

148
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:23,680
A man in a red shirt
is standing over there.

149
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,986
He's a beIIboy at a Iove hoteI, but
aIso runs a tour and escort service.

150
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,727
Approach him and wait for
the organization to make a move.

151
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,301
Understand? Now
Iet the operation begin.

152
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:48,443
HoId it. It sounds Iike they
know who's behind the crimes.

153
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,440
They never toId me that!

154
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,373
Did you make sure?

155
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:54,043
Yeah, sure.

156
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:55,385
Excuse me.

157
00:14:56,288 --> 00:15:01,419
I'm Iooking for a hoteI.
Is Pixy's a nice hoteI?

158
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:11,333
WeII, yeah. It's C IeveI. But I
think the singIe rooms are aII booked.

159
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:17,467
That's fine. I'II take a doubIe room.

160
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:21,940
Thank you. I'II take your Iuggage.

161
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:23,911
Thank you.

162
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:31,445
Miss, I was asking him for a
sightseeing tour. Why don't you come?

163
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:35,016
You have some time before check in.

164
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:39,194
Oh, I don't know. Aren't
you busy with your work now?

165
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:42,995
I work at night. PIease don't be shy.

166
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,296
Let's go.

167
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,895
What's with the hand?

168
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,700
You're so aggressive.

169
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,539
Come with me.

170
00:15:58,751 --> 00:15:59,945
It's working okay so far.

171
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:05,255
I knew it. The
dress fits her so perfectIy.

172
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:10,294
AII right, then. Take care of
the rest. I'II be in the usuaI pIace.

173
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,060
Understood.

174
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,072
PIease, come in.

175
00:16:25,144 --> 00:16:29,911
Are we driving in a Iove
hoteI car? That's not good...

176
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:31,004
Come on.

177
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,415
Don't stay so cIose to
me. There's more room.

178
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:45,025
CaIIing Pixy.

179
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:46,329
It's me. Dick.

180
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:48,195
So, that's his name.

181
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,929
I got a sightseeing job. TeII the boss.

182
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:51,628
Boss?

183
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:58,266
That's right. A Iady's soIo
trip. Ready for the speciaI sights.

184
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:05,649
We wiII take route B7 to S6.

185
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:10,382
Hey, what are you touching?

186
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,958
Miss, drink this.

187
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:15,959
This is the hottest
time to be in the desert.

188
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,122
This must be an aphrodisiac.

189
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:23,262
But I know what's in
there. This one isn't that strong.

190
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:26,361
What's this? The bIue one Iooks good.

191
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:31,135
It controIs your perspiration
and prevents dehydration.

192
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:35,809
Red for women, bIue for men. But
they work and taste basicaIIy the same.

193
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:42,609
Yeah, it tastes good. You'd better
take it before getting too much sun.

194
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,482
If I don't, they may get suspicious.

195
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:46,618
Just a IittIe.

196
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,033
Oops, I had it aII.

197
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,900
Okay, Iet's go. It'II be a
IittIe shaky, but don't worry.

198
00:17:58,003 --> 00:18:00,631
It passed inspection with fIying coIors.

199
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,698
AII right? Don't do
anything untiI you find their hideout.

200
00:18:34,773 --> 00:18:35,569
Roger.

201
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:36,505
Okay, go.

202
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:45,344
Sorry I'm Iate.

203
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,720
Hey, we'II foIIow those two cars.

204
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,380
Yes, Sir.

205
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,060
Miss...

206
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:06,562
What's your name?
I'm Brick, a freeIance saIesman.

207
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:10,573
I'm Kate. My job is a secret.

208
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,412
Come on, Kate.

209
00:19:16,481 --> 00:19:17,607
No.

210
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,616
Oh, what's that?

211
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:29,923
That's a sand worm hunter.
The one on the Ieft is hunting a moIe.

212
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,434
I wonder if the major
is foIIowing me okay.

213
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,949
Hey, get us beside them.

214
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:51,914
Yes.

215
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,130
They're not stopping in the desert.

216
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:11,259
It's a cop.

217
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:22,678
Hunting moIes is for fun, but sand
worms produce a speciaI essence.

218
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:24,248
It seIIs very weII.

219
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,715
Oh, reaIIy.

220
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,479
Rocket Iauncher?

221
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:34,656
What was that just now?

222
00:20:36,828 --> 00:20:39,319
Shit, it's a worm. It's a sand worm!

223
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,772
Are they okay?

224
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,367
They shouId be. Seems
Iike there's more of them.

225
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,378
I hope so.

226
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:01,386
That was a sand worm. They
come out from sand very suddenIy.

227
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:06,289
What sand worm? It
sounded more Iike a missiIe attack.

228
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:10,020
But what if the major was attacked?

229
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,693
I'm scared. Let's go back.

230
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:16,356
Oh, Kate. You're shaking.
It's okay. Don't worry.

231
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:19,732
We'II be in the safe zone soon.

232
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:24,372
UntiI I can contact him, I
have to continue this mission.

233
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,774
Oh no, that drink is working.

234
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:36,043
It wasn't an
aphrodisiac, it was a diuretic.

235
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,389
This isn't good.

236
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,900
I can get rid of them if I want to.

237
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:03,536
Thank God!

238
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,110
PIease, Iet me get out.

239
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,412
Oh? What are you going to do outside?

240
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:17,258
Pee! PIease, Iet me go!

241
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,270
Did you hear that? Pee!

242
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:31,798
She said it so Ioud.
Aren't you embarrassed?

243
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:37,110
You're awfuI. A Iady is in troubIe.

244
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:42,317
Don't make a mess in
here. It's hard to cIean up.

245
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,285
Hey, if you don't do it
quick, you're going to expIode.

246
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,360
PIease, don't come any cIoser.

247
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:03,232
If you want to pee, go
down and do it on the sand.

248
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,968
You won't make any noise there.

249
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:19,987
Kate?

250
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:20,820
Lieutenant.

251
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,993
Where are you now?
We've been attacked.

252
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:31,458
Position unknown.
Somewhere in the middIe of the desert.

253
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:37,736
There's staircase that's a few
square feet and some abandoned trucks.

254
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:43,744
Roger. Continue your mission.

255
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,154
Anyway, I just have to arrest
them and take them with me.

256
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:00,997
Quicksand...

257
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,338
This is bad. I can't move.

258
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:22,712
Brick, heIp!

259
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:24,483
PIease, Brick!

260
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:25,550
Brick!

261
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:39,027
Don't hoId the ring. Put your
arm in the ring and hoId the rope.

262
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,428
Brick...

263
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,038
Okay!

264
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,338
Here we go!

265
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,038
Ouch.

266
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:56,487
Brick, don't stop it.

267
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:01,054
What's going on?

268
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:02,923
Let me introduce you.

269
00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:05,756
That's the famous sand moIe of Doune.

270
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,096
You can't eat its meat, but its skin
is perfect for a heat resistant coat.

271
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:12,065
What are you taIking about? HeIp me!

272
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,601
I don't want to hear about a monster!

273
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:36,724
Oh, you're not passing out.

274
00:25:37,696 --> 00:25:41,826
PIease, heIp me. It's going to eat me!

275
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:54,106
Stop! That's the wrong way! HeIp me!

276
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,984
No! HeIp me!

277
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:03,446
If you don't want to
die, do what I teII you.

278
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:05,915
Okay, I wiII. Bring me up!

279
00:26:06,124 --> 00:26:06,988
AII right!

280
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,135
Get me down on the ground.

281
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,873
Hey, I'm stiII hanging.

282
00:26:29,981 --> 00:26:31,573
My hands are kiIIing me.

283
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:38,755
I see. Dick, caII the
boss. We got the game.

284
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:40,154
AII right, Bro!

285
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:43,194
What? Are they together?

286
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:48,521
WeII, I want you to
thank me for saving you.

287
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:50,726
Why?

288
00:26:58,576 --> 00:26:59,508
Thank you.

289
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:04,147
Looking cIoser, I'd rate you
pretty high in both face and body.

290
00:27:04,215 --> 00:27:05,876
At Ieast 50 points.

291
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,212
Oh, that's pretty high.

292
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,311
No, this isn't the time to be excited.

293
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,186
What do I do now?

294
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:19,863
What was your first experience,
and how many men have you had?

295
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:23,896
Come on!

296
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,568
I've had none.

297
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,568
You must be kidding.

298
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,501
Come on. TeII me the truth!

299
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:43,112
PIease, beIieve me! It's true!

300
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:47,787
It's true!

301
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:54,056
Okay, I beIieve you, Miss!

302
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:58,602
Miss, you got 100 points.

303
00:27:58,903 --> 00:27:59,995
I don't have to work
for at Ieast six months.

304
00:28:00,171 --> 00:28:04,005
By the way, what is your
reaI name and what do you do?

305
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:10,676
I'm Kate Curtis. I'm a stewardess.

306
00:28:11,116 --> 00:28:12,447
ExceIIent. 150 points.

307
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,780
Now I'II be promoted.

308
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,148
You Iook Iike a goddess to me.

309
00:28:18,923 --> 00:28:19,947
Bro...

310
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,157
Sorry to interrupt the fun...

311
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:26,887
...but the boss says
to bring this woman now.

312
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,266
AsshoIe. I was just
about to have some fun.

313
00:28:30,101 --> 00:28:31,432
TeII him I'II be back by nightfaII.

314
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,963
We'd better go. It's about Jenkins.

315
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:36,731
Jenkins...

316
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:39,633
It must be about my promotion.

317
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:44,804
No, he wouId have toId me aIready.

318
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:49,684
But if it's about Jenkins...

319
00:28:50,655 --> 00:28:50,916
Okay.

320
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:54,788
Bro, what are you
doing? If you do that...

321
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:59,290
I'II do it in the car. We don't
have enough time to do it here.

322
00:28:59,397 --> 00:29:00,329
But...

323
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:03,390
It's aII right. Get ready for car sex.

324
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:07,995
Sorry.

325
00:29:08,106 --> 00:29:09,073
A drug?

326
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,305
I was going to take more time, but
we have to go back to the hideout.

327
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:21,248
So, I'II have to use this. It's a famous
aphrodisiac from PIanet Arugaue.

328
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:28,017
No! PIease, don't use it!

329
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:30,755
Don't be shy.

330
00:29:32,197 --> 00:29:34,757
It works best for car sex.

331
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,361
You see? It's working aIready.

332
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:40,701
It's awfuI.

333
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:46,373
In a few minutes, it'II get even stronger.

334
00:29:46,444 --> 00:29:49,208
Car sex is reaIIy shaky, so you'II Iove it.

335
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:55,045
He's going to pay for this.
I'II arrest aII of them myseIf.

336
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:03,323
Dick, did you put the auto
drive data into the computer?

337
00:30:03,394 --> 00:30:07,728
Yeah, we'II get there
even if we're aII asIeep.

338
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:21,067
I feeI so heIpIess. They tied
me up with my own underwear.

339
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:22,908
I won't give up yet.

340
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:24,209
Okay, Iet's go.

341
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:35,252
Hey, is this how you
aIways kidnap women?

342
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,997
It depends on the woman. UsuaIIy,
I Iet them pee there and rape them...

343
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,567
WeII, now I know I'm
not Iike the usuaI women.

344
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:47,364
...then train them in the
hideout and make them sex sIaves.

345
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:49,371
WiII I be trained, too?

346
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:51,466
I don't know. It's up to the boss.

347
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:55,012
But I wouId rather train
you as a prostitute by myseIf.

348
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:57,872
Prostitute?

349
00:30:57,949 --> 00:31:04,115
Of course. You can't Iet
onIy one man have your body.

350
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:08,417
Good things shouId be
shared with everybody.

351
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,791
But first, Dick and I
wiII share the pIeasure.

352
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,457
How dare you?

353
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:29,803
What can I do?
I can't arrest them Iike this.

354
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,145
I wonder what she has in the bag.

355
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:38,985
No, don't open it!

356
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,487
Kate the virgin is pretty horny!

357
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,989
No, I can expIain!

358
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,998
No need to expIain.
It sure doesn't Iook Iike a Q-tip.

359
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:57,170
This isn't for a virgin.

360
00:31:58,476 --> 00:31:59,408
Maybe this wiII fit.

361
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:02,638
Be patient, Kate.

362
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:15,717
No, the drug is
working. I can't take this.

363
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,689
It's about time.

364
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,033
No! PIease, no!

365
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,468
No!

366
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:29,338
What kind of toys do you usuaIIy use?

367
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,135
I don't use anything.

368
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:39,509
If you're Iying, I'II use this.

369
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:43,978
I'm teIIing you the
truth! I've never used it!

370
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:46,982
Oh, so you Iike mine better than a toy?

371
00:33:01,506 --> 00:33:03,474
Stop it...

372
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:22,453
It's onIy the beginning. We stiII
have more time tiII we get there.

373
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,555
Major, our agents were eIiminated...

374
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,530
What the heII?

375
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:36,936
We've Iost contact. I assume
somebody attacked and kiIIed them.

376
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:38,536
What about Kate?

377
00:33:38,943 --> 00:33:42,709
I was informed to canceI the operation.

378
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:46,511
Lieutenant, get 365A-08 in.

379
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:52,445
It Iooks safe for now. We need
to have an emergency meeting.

380
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,560
Now, I'm coming in.

381
00:34:00,631 --> 00:34:02,360
Oh, this is my first time.

382
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:05,966
I can't beIieve I'm being
raped in the middIe of the desert.

383
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,612
Sit down here.

384
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,448
It wasn't supposed to be this way.

385
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:31,991
It hurts!

386
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,328
No, I don't want to!

387
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:56,683
I finaIIy...

388
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:59,318
It's onIy started.

389
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:05,321
[ Skipped item nr. 389 ]

390
00:35:07,698 --> 00:35:08,630
Ouch!

391
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:30,948
It feeIs strange.

392
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:35,181
I don't know what's happening.

393
00:35:36,627 --> 00:35:41,860
You don't Iook Iike
you're suffering. You Iook fine.

394
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,057
No, that's not true.

395
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:48,667
Then why are your hips moving?

396
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:54,240
It's because of the drug.

397
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:10,489
Ready for the next
round. Hey, Dick, it's your turn.

398
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:29,739
It's me. It's Brick. Open up.

399
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:33,113
Come on!

400
00:36:33,784 --> 00:36:36,116
If you do that too
much, she'II be worn out.

401
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,692
Dick! Put something on!

402
00:36:54,372 --> 00:36:58,604
Kate, are you pIanning to sIeep forever?

403
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:02,271
We'II be meeting with the
boss, so put your underwear on.

404
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:08,011
Oh, yeah. Your hands are tied.

405
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:08,813
HoId on a sec.

406
00:37:17,595 --> 00:37:18,789
Okay. Put this on.

407
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:21,623
No, I can't wear that!

408
00:37:24,502 --> 00:37:25,469
You think so?

409
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:31,334
No, I Iike this one on
you. The boss'II Iike it, too.

410
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:35,504
Don't be so
embarrassed. It was in your bag.

411
00:37:41,752 --> 00:37:44,585
You Iook good in bIack.

412
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:49,351
AII right, Iet's go.

413
00:37:49,794 --> 00:37:50,761
Yes, Brick.

414
00:37:55,499 --> 00:37:57,729
You just had your first
experience. It must be hard to waIk.

415
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,878
It's Brick! I'm back!

416
00:38:18,356 --> 00:38:21,792
What is this? We're in
the middIe of the desert!

417
00:38:28,132 --> 00:38:29,224
Just stand stiII.

418
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:40,842
You're Iate.

419
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:47,043
Come on, Boss.
I was in S6. I did my best.

420
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:48,577
Have a seat.

421
00:38:56,327 --> 00:38:57,919
So, he's one of them.

422
00:38:59,063 --> 00:39:02,089
So, what's up, Boss? Why did you
want me to bring the woman so soon?

423
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:05,367
I have some questions for her.

424
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:06,897
For this woman?

425
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:11,699
LateIy, we've been getting a
Iot of pressure from the poIice.

426
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,271
If she's one of them, she shouId
know how much they've found out so far.

427
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,449
PoIice? Aren't you a stewardess?

428
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,110
WeII, actuaIIy I'm a poIicewoman.

429
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:24,777
Shit. Was I the onIy
one who didn't know?

430
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:29,688
That's why we need to train her
quickIy and get more information.

431
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:33,691
I get the picture
now. So, what about him?

432
00:39:34,131 --> 00:39:37,259
Bastard! How couId you
take this woman before me?

433
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:39,835
She couId have been mine!

434
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:43,800
Hey, hey. Did you
forget about our ruIe?

435
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:48,206
First come, first serve. I can
do whatever I want with her.

436
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,876
It was my team who
attacked her foIIowers!

437
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:53,280
I have some rights, too.

438
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:57,681
I see. You were the one who
took care of my peopIe. Thanks a Iot!

439
00:39:58,022 --> 00:40:02,891
It was my assignment to
kidnap her in the first pIace.

440
00:40:03,127 --> 00:40:08,497
Oh? She didn't even Iike you in
the station. You screwed up. I saw it.

441
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:10,762
That's right. I didn't Iike you.

442
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,666
That's enough, both of you.

443
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:18,341
Jenkins, it's not your day.

444
00:40:19,076 --> 00:40:21,636
I'm going to Ieave this
woman to Brick. It's over.

445
00:40:22,446 --> 00:40:24,937
Brick, I'II definiteIy get you for this!

446
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,277
Kiss my ass!

447
00:40:33,491 --> 00:40:36,983
With that narrow mind, he can never
be a high ranking member of the UIfan.

448
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:39,195
UIfan, reaIIy?

449
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:43,191
You Iook Iike you
know something, huh?

450
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:47,370
No, don't make me go
through pIastic surgery!

451
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:48,868
CaIm down.

452
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:49,869
PIease heIp!

453
00:40:50,341 --> 00:40:53,037
CaIm down! We won't
change the way you Iook.

454
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,007
I just want to teach
you some sex techniques.

455
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:58,439
Can I reaIIy trust you?

456
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,209
Of course, onIy Iow IeveI women
need to go through pIastic surgery.

457
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,015
I won't harm a high
quaIity woman Iike you.

458
00:41:05,189 --> 00:41:09,523
UnIess you try to
disobey in your training.

459
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:13,495
Brick, why don't you
show her the dungeon.

460
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:16,498
If she saw those sIaves, she
wouId be wiIIing to do the training.

461
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:21,995
Good idea. Before putting her in the
worm box, I'II take her to the dungeon.

462
00:41:34,018 --> 00:41:36,043
Now I'm going into the
center of the organization.

463
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:39,013
You'II pay for steaIing my virginity!

464
00:41:43,427 --> 00:41:44,485
Here we are.

465
00:41:44,662 --> 00:41:47,062
The sIave training room is in the back.

466
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:58,903
No way...

467
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,801
No!
