1
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:15,200
Snow?

2
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:17,708
It's snow!

3
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:18,811
Wow!

4
00:00:20,549 --> 00:00:22,574
It's almost spring now.

5
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,885
Are we going to be here next spring?

6
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:31,787
Maybe nothing will
change while he's around.

7
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:09,395
Even a stone on
the street has some meaning.

8
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:15,164
I recall such a saying
from a long time ago.

9
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:19,298
This kind of nostalgia doesn't suit me.

10
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:21,937
If it was like before...

11
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:27,878
If I was as I was in those
days of vanities and greed...

12
00:01:29,618 --> 00:01:35,716
I wouldn't have taken notice
of a girl shivering in the snow.

13
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:03,416
Welcome.

14
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:13,058
Leese, have you ever
seen a mansion before?

15
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:14,788
No, sir.

16
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:24,267
Welcome.

17
00:02:26,108 --> 00:02:27,302
She is beautiful.

18
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,540
Our master is expecting you.

19
00:02:30,913 --> 00:02:32,107
Please, this way.

20
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:32,646
Thank you.

21
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:38,610
Leese!

22
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:40,689
Yes, sir.

23
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,823
Then, Mr. Dred, to the
prosperity of the Dred Foundation!

24
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,759
And to our country's future!

25
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:04,469
Did you call me, Mr. Dred?

26
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:08,012
Come in.

27
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:19,252
Mr. Foster, let me introduce my friend.

28
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:21,126
This is Mr. Leed.

29
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:27,793
Oh...

30
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:29,930
You are Mr. Foster.

31
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:31,873
I heard a lot about you.

32
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:32,901
Thank you.

33
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:37,543
We're going to take her
for a while upon his request.

34
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:42,177
She's not very clever or pretty.

35
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:45,009
But, could you train her properly?

36
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:46,517
I will do my best.

37
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:48,782
What's your name?

38
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,858
It's Leese, sir.

39
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:54,359
Do you think you
can bare to work here?

40
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:58,892
I'll do cleaning or laundry,
and work as hard as I can!

41
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:01,426
Take off your glasses.

42
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:02,393
What?

43
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:03,427
Hurry!

44
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:14,846
Stand straight, towards me.

45
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:22,353
Step forward.

46
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:23,355
Huh?

47
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,216
I said step forward!

48
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:26,852
Y-Yes, sir.

49
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:34,259
Oh, no...

50
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:35,892
I'm terribly sorry.

51
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:40,872
How about that.

52
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:44,601
Can you train her
to be a presentable lady?

53
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:49,009
Even a dog, if it is an order.

54
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:09,195
It's been a long time.

55
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:12,671
Since the Curey Port
collapsed ten years ago.

56
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:15,042
You ought not to mention it...

57
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:16,842
...for our own sake.

58
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:19,646
But I hear you are well-to-do now.

59
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:22,074
And you're a loan shark, aren't you?

60
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:23,911
Sort of.

61
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,450
But I have a plan.

62
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:28,622
What?

63
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:29,749
That's right.

64
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,787
I'm going to get my
success back again.

65
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:35,757
What's wrong?

66
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:37,926
Aren't you going to help me?

67
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:42,335
You seriously think it's
possible to revive the organization?

68
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:44,669
You've changed.

69
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:46,471
Of course.

70
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:50,074
Since I've gone
through that painful time.

71
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:51,704
Why not help me, then?

72
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:55,208
I'm content with the work here.

73
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:58,814
I'm disappointed in you.

74
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:05,188
But, let me tell you...

75
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:08,896
...you are just like those birds!

76
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:11,955
Well...

77
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:15,734
Think it over, which is
more beneficial to you.

78
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:45,697
Forgive me, Leese.

79
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:47,365
I have no choice.

80
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:50,362
Don't worry, Mother.

81
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:52,697
You have nothing special...

82
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:56,205
...but if you work hard,
there will be a reward for you.

83
00:06:58,981 --> 00:07:00,710
Sister, don't go!

84
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:03,378
Sister, sister!

85
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:26,904
Good morning, Mr. Foster.

86
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:32,411
From today on,
she is working with you.

87
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:35,046
My name is Leese.

88
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,884
Please to meet you.

89
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,484
Teach her the work, everybody.

90
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:41,913
Yes, sir.

91
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,652
Here I go.

92
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:51,331
I have such a hangover this morning!

93
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,724
You don't look too good.

94
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:56,235
I'll do it, so please go get some rest.

95
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:58,371
You don't mind?

96
00:07:58,507 --> 00:07:59,633
Thank you.

97
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:09,575
Oh, my head!

98
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:21,726
I'm done.

99
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,528
Already?

100
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:24,626
Really?

101
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,672
You're going to be okay
without me teaching you what to do.

102
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:38,407
We all welcome hard workers like you.

103
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:42,614
I'm not pretty like you...

104
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:46,018
...so the only thing
I can do is work hard.

105
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:52,356
You didn't use clothes pins, did you?

106
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:53,292
What?

107
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:54,725
Oh, no!

108
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,863
What are we going to do?

109
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:09,702
Got it.

110
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:17,741
I-I'm sorry!

111
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:19,485
Oh, no.

112
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:21,546
We just finished cleaning!

113
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:23,354
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,490
Don't worry about it.

115
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:29,393
If you work too hard from the
start, you'll be exhausted in no time.

116
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:31,697
You have to take a break.

117
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:33,129
But...

118
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:34,665
What's wrong?

119
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:39,939
I've always been
working, so I never took a break.

120
00:09:41,676 --> 00:09:44,304
Why don't you learn from her, Aisha!

121
00:09:45,514 --> 00:09:48,312
Yeah, yeah, it's your fault!

122
00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:50,781
I'm so sorry.

123
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:52,752
I was just kidding.

124
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,651
You are so tense!

125
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,617
Don't be so serious.

126
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,051
Come on now, smile!

127
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:02,661
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,164
Good.

129
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:14,734
Smells good!

130
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:16,505
Tastes good!

131
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:18,708
You are a really good cook!

132
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:20,513
Really?

133
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:22,642
Hurry up!

134
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:23,843
What's taking so long?

135
00:10:23,952 --> 00:10:24,714
Yes, sir!

136
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:26,452
Ouch!

137
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:29,555
What are you doing?

138
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,780
You useless!

139
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:37,389
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

140
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:40,263
Hey, you don't have
to slap her like that!

141
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:43,396
I told you not to talk back to me...

142
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,835
...if you want to stay here.

143
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:49,741
But, you overreacted!

144
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:52,645
Please, Aisha.

145
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:54,306
I know.

146
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:57,914
I'm such a useless person.

147
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:08,793
Maybe she needs
some rough treatment.

148
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:28,664
Don't be so nervous.

149
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:29,834
Yes.

150
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:33,028
Excuse me.

151
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:47,312
Go inside.

152
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:56,757
Look carefully.

153
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,361
This is your work.

154
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:00,431
What?

155
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,334
Why don't you come here?

156
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:10,070
I can't do it!

157
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:11,132
Go!

158
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:16,509
Come on.

159
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:17,877
O-Ouch!

160
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:20,514
Sir, she is not yet...

161
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:21,209
Shut up!

162
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,707
No!

163
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:51,848
That hurts!

164
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:04,825
No, please don't!

165
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,699
No, please don't!

166
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:20,838
No, no...

167
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:27,747
No...

168
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,917
No!

169
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:50,735
No, please don't...

170
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:55,240
No, no, no...

171
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:06,085
This girl could be a find.

172
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:14,632
Don't punish me.

173
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:15,290
Shut up!

174
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:20,696
Meah, help her undress.

175
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:21,335
Yes.

176
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:27,808
Take your hands off.

177
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:28,780
What?

178
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:31,575
Cross your hands behind
your back and stand straight.

179
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,021
Take those off.

180
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:49,197
Your body is not bad.

181
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:58,575
But, too overweight!

182
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:03,446
Don't sob!

183
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,244
Open your legs over there.

184
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:11,788
I can't do such a thing.

185
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:13,357
Leese.

186
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:16,859
You still don't
understand your situation.

187
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:20,389
This is the training for you to stay here.

188
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,800
If you can't obey me, get out of here!

189
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:29,803
I see.

190
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:34,445
Meah.

191
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:35,411
Yes.

192
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:06,110
Now, lift your legs and show
me how you take your customer.

193
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:14,476
You don't even know how to use it.

194
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:18,816
Don't move!

195
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:20,181
Don't!

196
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:46,347
No...

197
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,946
Sir...

198
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,223
Isn't she trying too hard?

199
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,858
Not yet.

200
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,118
What happened?

201
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:30,384
Foster has gone too far.

202
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:33,125
He has?

203
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:37,467
Somehow, he gets
too intense with this girl.

204
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,027
I see.

205
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,067
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

206
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,741
Wow, it's beautiful!

207
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:28,544
An angel...

208
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:30,853
Angel.

209
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:34,854
What are you looking at?

210
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:37,092
I-I'm sorry.

211
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:37,953
I'm...

212
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:41,029
You can have it, if you like.

213
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:44,996
You like books, don't you?

214
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:49,672
If you want to read more
books, you can come back anytime.

215
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:51,865
Thank you very much.

216
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:54,873
I didn't attend school full time...

217
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,913
...so I never was
allowed to have books before.

218
00:18:58,183 --> 00:18:59,343
Thank you very much.

219
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:01,278
Thank you.

220
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:13,356
I'm sorry.

221
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:15,260
What happened?

222
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,365
Anything wrong?

223
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:21,435
Ms. Myuha let me have this book.

224
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:24,976
Before putting on knowledge...

225
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:28,302
...try taking off some
pounds from your body.

226
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,564
Hi, Leese.

227
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:52,827
What's up at this late hour?

228
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:56,332
Mr. Foster ordered an evening snack.

229
00:19:57,876 --> 00:20:01,277
It's good for you,
Foster seems fond of you.

230
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,340
L-lt's not that.

231
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:06,280
Like you didn't know.

232
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:10,881
When he's harsh on someone,
it's his way of showing affection.

233
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,115
Aisha!

234
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,283
You know we're not allowed to drink!

235
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:16,156
You're annoying, leave me alone!

236
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:18,791
Stop!

237
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:20,559
Aisha!

238
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:21,825
Aisha!

239
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:30,801
Aisha...

240
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:38,072
Mr. Foster is taking time with
Leese because she's slower than others.

241
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:40,649
You should know that!

242
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:44,846
If Foster takes
more time on someone...

243
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,254
...he takes less time
with somebody else!

244
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,423
Being jealous is not a nice thing.

245
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,393
Are you really okay
with that know-it-all attitude?

246
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,229
You don't even know
what your real feelings are!

247
00:21:04,676 --> 00:21:06,041
Maybe you're right.

248
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,302
Good girl...

249
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:41,908
What's next?

250
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:42,664
You never know.

251
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:46,408
Now Leese is a popular one.

252
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:51,048
Isn't it about time to return her?

253
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:53,378
No need for that anymore.

254
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:54,641
What do you mean?

255
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:57,852
That man went broke.

256
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:03,153
Therefore, we don't
need to send her back to him.

257
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:06,326
I see.

258
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:11,630
It's not a big deal to
make somebody go broke.

259
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:20,536
You are not thinking about
whatever he was trying, are you?

260
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,672
It's long time ago.

261
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,520
You seem to enjoy reading.

262
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:41,664
Mr. Foster.

263
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,064
I-I'm sorry.

264
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:46,230
Don't be so apologetic.

265
00:23:47,472 --> 00:23:48,268
Good news.

266
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:51,474
Your debts are recouped.

267
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:55,110
What did you just say?

268
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:58,743
I said you don't owe anybody anymore.

269
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:02,051
You have been patient enough.

270
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:03,946
Now you are free.

271
00:24:06,158 --> 00:24:07,182
Free...

272
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,951
What's wrong?

273
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:10,791
Aren't you happy?

274
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:15,428
Wherever I go, it's
going to be difficult anyway.

275
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,390
Have some confidence!

276
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,333
You'll be okay wherever you go now.

277
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:24,598
But, I'd like to be here.

278
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:30,344
This book is very good.

279
00:24:31,216 --> 00:24:34,947
At least until I finish
this book, let me stay, please.

280
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:40,324
That sounds like you.

281
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:42,050
Leese!

282
00:24:43,995 --> 00:24:45,292
It's time.

283
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:47,931
Yes!

284
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,334
Hurry up!

285
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,598
Oh, you are so clumsy!

286
00:24:58,343 --> 00:24:59,776
I'm so sorry.

287
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:01,709
Are you okay?

288
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,570
Let us help you stand up...

289
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:04,773
Are you really okay?

290
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:06,111
I'm fine, thanks.

291
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:19,206
I'm just like those birds.

292
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:21,116
I know...

293
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:22,943
But...

294
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:25,920
What can I do now?

295
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:37,065
What do you want?

296
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:41,361
Please tell me...

297
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,336
...what happened...

298
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:47,172
...between you and my mother, Fahm?

299
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:50,807
I heard from Ren.

300
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:55,614
You were saying
my mother's name in your sleep.

301
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:58,750
Actually...

302
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:01,659
...I had been in love with Fahm.

303
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:08,926
Then, I dumped her.

304
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:13,031
Why?

305
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:15,869
Please, tell me the reason.
