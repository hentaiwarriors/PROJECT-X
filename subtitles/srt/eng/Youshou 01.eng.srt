1
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,144
Maruki, give me a status report.

2
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:51,821
Yes. He died about a week ago,
and Proto Machine number four...

3
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:54,156
was administered two hours ago.

4
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:01,021
Mother!

5
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:28,849
How sad that they become such things
when pulled from death's grasp.

6
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:30,146
Kaidoh.

7
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:30,988
Yes.

8
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:35,355
There's no time. l only have
a limited amount of power left.

9
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:36,921
l understand.

10
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:40,793
L-Lady Mother, please wait a bit longer!

11
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:42,467
l'm counting on you.

12
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:16,032
l see. Well then let me
tell your fortune with this.

13
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:20,738
What?

14
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:26,206
<i>Go! Kick her ass! Yeah!</i>

15
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,014
<i>Congratulations!</i>

16
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,541
Thank you very much!

17
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:38,591
Take that!

18
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,885
This isn't even a challenge.

19
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:46,564
What the... He's not getting hurt
even if l shoot him.

20
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:49,298
Damn.

21
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,137
Uh oh!

22
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:08,248
<i>Ladies, l hope you enjoyed your time off.
Now, here's your next mission...</i>

23
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:12,188
<i>There are reports of dead bodies...</i>

24
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:32,641
<i>Episode 1: Suspicion</i>

25
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:55,059
Rumor has it that the Lady Mother
is several hundred years old.

26
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:58,435
That's a story that you
hear a lot in modern cults.

27
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:03,636
The founder of Charisma, Kaidoh Ochi, is
backed by a lady mother of unknown age.

28
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:06,271
Sounds more interesting than
checking out some hospital!

29
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:18,324
Hello.

30
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:21,885
Oh Shiori, l hear that cast
is going to come off soon.

31
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:25,596
Doctor Maruki said he'd
take the cast off tomorrow.

32
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:30,292
What's the matter? You seem sad.
When you get out, we should hang out.

33
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:33,764
l still have my rehab.

34
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:36,601
l see, so you still have more to go.

35
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:38,237
You can do it, Shiori.

36
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,408
l hope you get to walk again soon.

37
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,307
Yeah. See you later.

38
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:50,455
Shiori's entire family died in a bad
accident, and she's the only survivor.

39
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:51,722
Any relatives?

40
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:56,117
She has no siblings, and her
grandparents are already deceased.

41
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,425
That's a bleak future.

42
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:01,257
<i>Even when she gets out,
she doesn't have anywhere to go.</i>

43
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:05,137
<i>Doctor Giin, please try to relax.</i>

44
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:11,534
<i>We will now begin the ceremony.</i>

45
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,442
There is nothing to be afraid of.

46
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,456
Now is the time for you to rise.

47
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:04,722
You will gather a flock
that will rise above all others.

48
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:09,834
You will be the one to lead
these weak and lost lambs.

49
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:21,609
The word of God shall protect you.

50
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:26,913
Do what you believe,
what your soul tells you to do.

51
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:09,817
lt is done.

52
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,328
Thank you for your work.

53
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:17,760
That man will stand at the apex.
He had the power to change the world.

54
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:19,129
''Had,'' you say?

55
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:21,772
He will eventually die.

56
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,639
<i>He is taking the long
route to regaining his time.</i>

57
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:30,907
<i>lf we treated him now we could
extend his life, but he would not wish it.</i>

58
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:38,780
<i>130 years ago, his great grandfather
sacrificed himself for me and fell.</i>

59
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:43,926
<i>Their dispositions are very similar.
lt feels almost like yesterday.</i>

60
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:50,498
<i>Having lived since the era of Heian,
l have seen the whole of humanity.</i>

61
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,170
l'm sorry, Mother. lf l had inherited
even a little of your power...

62
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,305
lt is better that you did not.

63
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,739
<i>To make someone relive the pain
of death even after their life ends...</i>

64
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:08,520
<i>Mother, please don't say such things.</i>

65
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:14,151
<i>Kaidoh, my last son, with those hands...</i>

66
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:14,986
<i>Mother...</i>

67
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:18,723
<i>Let me sleep for a little while.</i>

68
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:24,002
l will send over the directions
for the teachings to your terminal.

69
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:38,977
<i>Call for Maruki!</i>

70
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,648
Hey, you really did your research.

71
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:48,826
lt passes the time. l snuck in
my laptop and tried a bunch of hacks.

72
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:52,258
But there's something weird
with this place's security.

73
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:55,060
That tells me a lot. Thanks!

74
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:02,237
Hey, l bet you're pent up.

75
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,674
Ah, nurse, you really don't...

76
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,650
You came already?

77
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,700
Figures it wouldn't work.
They keep getting ahead of me.

78
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:11,572
Bingo! How'd l get in suddenly? Huh?
They have Shiori's data too.

79
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:17,109
But why? What reason do they
have to keep this data separate?

80
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:53,843
Y-Yes, Kiriku General.
What? They're on the verge of dying?

81
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,351
lt wasn't that bad this morning!
Strange. And the other hospitals?

82
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:01,955
Then you don't have to send them here!
Our beds are full, dammit!

83
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:08,329
You! Quit fooling around!
There are important calls around here!

84
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:09,834
Y-Yes sir! l'm sorry.

85
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:15,163
Christ. And you! Where were you?
Did you check on Mr. Harada?

86
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:19,269
<i>Doctor Maruki, please check
on Mr. Harada in room 303!</i>

87
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:32,048
<i>Patients with no relatives?</i>

88
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,427
<i>Shiori</i>

89
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:39,229
<i>Yes, everyone who
was in that separate data...</i>

90
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:47,673
<i>Yeah... They even bring in patients
from other hospitals who all...</i>

91
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:50,801
<i>for some reason or another,
share that one common thing.</i>

92
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,874
<i>Being backed by a large parent
company, they're supposed to be...</i>

93
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:57,314
<i>known for accepting any
patient who comes in, but...</i>

94
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,519
<i>there's a patient whose
very existence was erased.</i>

95
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,812
<i>lf we think about the reason,
then the information the boss got...</i>

96
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:08,517
<i>that dead bodies vanish from
this hospital, becomes more credible.</i>

97
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:09,625
<i>That's right.</i>

98
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:10,887
<i>What's it mean?</i>

99
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:15,624
<i>We don't know yet. We can be sure
that the hospital is definitely...</i>

100
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:18,228
<i>neck deep in some
highly illegal activity.</i>

101
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,913
Shiori, you poor thing.

102
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:49,264
Hey you monks! What did you
do with the patient who died today?

103
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:07,847
Dirty trick.

104
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:26,565
l guess it's just about
time to make our rounds.

105
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,808
Hey, what are those guys for?

106
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:33,901
Oh l thought they might
cheer up Shiori a bit. See?

107
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,040
Sure, but you're not allowed
to bring animals into the hospital.

108
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:43,286
<i>Oh l see, they were your Shikigami.</i>

109
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:46,789
Hey, what happened to Yuka?

110
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:51,659
You know, she went to go check
on how Shiori was doing a while ago...

111
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:53,665
Oh crap!

112
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:17,466
Yuka, where are you?

113
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:19,794
Come on! Where are you?

114
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:21,628
Yuka!

115
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:30,045
Yuka!

116
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:48,122
Those damned monks!

117
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:55,099
No good. l can't access
the company's main computer!

118
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,940
l've never seen such
complex protection before.

119
00:19:58,477 --> 00:20:02,413
lt's not the hospital planning
something. lt's the parent company!

120
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:07,544
Hey, what the hell are they
using the dead bodies of patients for?

121
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:24,761
Dogs.

122
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:29,033
Come on Doctor Maruki...

123
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:34,636
Sakura, did you have a reason for
pulling me in here?

124
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:40,351
l want to have sex with you.

125
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:55,523
Oh, Doctor Maruki, you're so big!

126
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:18,551
l can die happy right now! l never
thought a woman would do this to me!

127
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:21,884
l'm in heaven!

128
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:27,561
Sakura, l'm cumming.
Can l cum in your mouth?

129
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,700
Yes, as much as you'd like.

130
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:35,901
Owww oww! What are you doing?

131
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:38,573
Where did the patients
who were taken out of here go?

132
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:40,708
What are you talking about?

133
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,107
Don't play dumb.

134
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,107
Snake!

135
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,245
Tell me now!

136
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:50,385
<i>Why don't you stop right there.</i>

137
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:04,635
Kaidoh Ochi.

138
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:10,772
Well now, l was wondering
what kind of stray dog wandered in,

139
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:13,237
but you're quite a lovely nurse.

140
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:17,404
Beautiful. You're just my type.

141
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,653
Damn it, l lost. The company main
computer has to be alive or something!

142
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:31,355
<i>We got trouble!</i>

143
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,059
Sakura's gone!
