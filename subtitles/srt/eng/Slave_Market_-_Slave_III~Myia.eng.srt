1
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:21,561
W-what are you?

2
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:23,795
Just let all your
worries go free, Cas.

3
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:40,287
W-wait, whoa, h-hold on.

4
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:55,869
Once the war starts,
many people will die.

5
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:59,367
What use is rationality
in a world like that?

6
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,886
I, Casius Gile Palvis, was sent on
an important mission by my country,

7
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:23,425
to Constantinovale in 1618...

8
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:33,337
Slave Market (Dorei Ichiba)

9
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:40,708
I'm glad that you enjoyed that.

10
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:42,581
Y-yeah.

11
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,843
Actually, I arranged an even
better gift for you.

12
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,251
Huh, a gift?

13
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:57,158
Yeah, I'm sure you'll love this.
So please accept.

14
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,723
Your new slave.

15
00:02:08,944 --> 00:02:10,002
She's beautiful.

16
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:15,481
It looks like she likes you too.

17
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:19,113
What's your name?

18
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:24,224
It's no use. She can't speak.

19
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:25,218
What?

20
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:30,054
Her name is Myia, and she's a
slave from around Kilkia...

21
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,327
When a girl is taken from
their village, they operate on them...

22
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:36,603
so they can't speak.

23
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:38,766
That's horrible...

24
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:42,536
But isn't she amazing?

25
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:44,701
Indeed she is...

26
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:52,715
You'll find out once you hold her,
but this honey-toned skin is said...

27
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:56,920
to be like a drug.
I'm sure you'll like her.

28
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,650
I can't wait.

29
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:13,171
Now, get in.

30
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:20,139
She's only a slave...
That's what I told myself.

31
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:26,080
I would just ignore the inconvenient
emotions. I was tired of being hurt.

32
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:37,156
Listen up. You are MY slave!

33
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,385
What a slutty ass you have!

34
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:54,667
Falco was right in saying
she was a drug.

35
00:04:55,844 --> 00:05:02,943
I lost myself in the sensation of
melting into her honey skin.

36
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:17,863
I'm going off to work.
You stay here and stay quiet.

37
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:45,988
It's a dandelion seed.
Flowers grow producing seed,

38
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:52,163
which in turn grow more flowers.
It's the cycle of all living things.

39
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,710
Umm... are we really all right
without an escort?

40
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:16,855
Today's meeting is unofficial.
We cannot bring guards with us.

41
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:18,314
B-but...

42
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:23,754
Besides. If the capital really
wanted me killed,

43
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:27,492
even a hundred personal guards
would be meaningless.

44
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:45,250
I have been waiting for you, Sir Barbarico.

45
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:49,522
May the Gods smile upon you...

46
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:53,324
Oh? And who is this young man?

47
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:57,362
He's a soldier from the Republic.
A staff officer named Palvis.

48
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,996
This is the Prime Minister of
the capital, Sir lvansic.

49
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:04,565
It's an honor to meet you.

50
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:15,510
The Prime Minister of lmar is
the only idealist left amidst...

51
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,743
the corrupted country.

52
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:21,348
He was known as a moderate thinker,

53
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:23,752
and paid close attention
to the war mongers.

54
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:38,995
What's wrong, Palvis?

55
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:40,801
Oh. Nothing.

56
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:07,392
Whenever my lust came out,
it was as if I let out my evil half.

57
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:18,236
What is this filthy juice?!

58
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:37,951
You dirty slut!
You'll have to be punished!

59
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:45,724
You're my slave! Get it!?
You'll be assaulted here forever!

60
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,201
No matter how much you hate it!

61
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:53,801
I became the lowest of the low,
and spewed phrase after phrase...

62
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:58,571
of the filthiest speech, trying
to shake my criminal emotions.

63
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:07,885
You, where did you get that woman?

64
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:12,685
Talk! Where is Myia?!

65
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:16,430
Indeed.
I do smell Myia's vaginal fluids.

66
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,766
W-who are you?!

67
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:26,334
Pardon us. He's a bit upset about
losing our pet. Please forgive him.

68
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:27,631
What are you talking about!?

69
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,675
We're talking about the girl you fucked.

70
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,043
I have a deal to make.
Would you please give us back the girl?

71
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,847
And if I decline?

72
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:43,314
Then we take your life.

73
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:44,420
What?!

74
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:47,852
Then, at some point, we
will come to claim her.

75
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:49,723
J-just try it!

76
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,332
A-an illusion?

77
00:10:57,405 --> 00:11:02,934
Myia has always been part
of the "Sages of the Hill."

78
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:09,042
Let us meet again soon.
Be well until then.

79
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:12,914
The "Sages of the Hill"?!

80
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:16,116
Yeah, I'm sure that's what they said...

81
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:20,423
If it's the legendary assassin group,
then I've heard rumors about them.

82
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:24,287
They say that none of their
targets have ever survived.

83
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:30,364
But weren't they defeated by the Horsemen
of Mongol hundreds of years ago?

84
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:35,998
I've heard rumors that a few of them
survived and now run black ops.

85
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:37,344
It can't be!

86
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:43,416
I'm going to lend this to you.
You know how to use it, right?

87
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:44,816
S-sure...

88
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,880
Well, you can never be too careful.
Okay, I'll excuse myself.

89
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:53,820
Alright. Thanks a lot.

90
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:58,460
Oh, I almost forgot the
most important thing.

91
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,632
Lately, the war mongers
have been really active.

92
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:04,795
You're sure?

93
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,776
Yeah, I do a lot of business with
some pretty important people.

94
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:11,543
The information is reliable.

95
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:17,141
I guess war is inevitable, then...

96
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:41,964
It stinks.

97
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:51,609
Here. Eat.

98
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:08,830
You're thanking me?!

99
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,303
You're grateful to the man
that's abusing you!?

100
00:13:18,246 --> 00:13:19,213
Stop it!

101
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:28,911
If you promise not to run, I'll take
the chains off. You swear?!

102
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:44,860
I'm sorry.

103
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:54,471
I'm sorry. So sorry.

104
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:04,219
You're beautiful. It suits you.

105
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:46,761
Actually, there's something
I need to tell you.

106
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:52,368
I have to leave this country soon.

107
00:14:55,242 --> 00:15:00,202
But, I want you to come with me.
Let's leave here together.

108
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:03,014
You won't have to be a slave anymore.

109
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:07,454
Myia!

110
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:26,500
What is it? Are you embarrassed?
No one's looking.

111
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:29,301
No, I don't care if people do stare!

112
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:05,136
I was drunk with my sudden happiness.

113
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:13,143
But I should have remembered,
hope quickly turns to despair.

114
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:27,294
Myia, you're beautiful.
Really beautiful.

115
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:30,592
Even here.

116
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,319
Do you want this?

117
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:51,755
Will you, please?
With your mouth?

118
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:03,497
Who's there?!

119
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:06,625
Sir Casius! The battle has started!
The war has begun!

120
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:08,423
What?!

121
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:10,731
The time had finally come.

122
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:15,132
My mission was to bring this
information back to my country.

123
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:18,670
Let us leave immediately.
The ship is waiting at the port.

124
00:18:20,347 --> 00:18:21,279
Hey!

125
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:26,620
Myia!

126
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:30,821
What's wrong, Myia?!

127
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:39,091
Are you looking for this?

128
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,009
We already know that you're
a spy for the Republic.

129
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:58,151
What?!

130
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:04,321
But, as I promised, if you give us
Myia, we'll spare your life.

131
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:05,892
Dammit!

132
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:08,892
What do you...?!

133
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:16,592
You know already. She's one of us.
Or I should say, used to be.

134
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:19,073
You bitch!

135
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:21,541
Why did you betray us and run!?

136
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:27,513
She means she wanted
to make her flowers grow.

137
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:34,449
Pathetic! No one is allowed to
leave us. Return, Myia!

138
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,627
M-Myia...

139
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:44,192
If you resist, we will kill him...

140
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:53,399
If you want womanly pleasures,
then I will give them to you.

141
00:21:21,195 --> 00:21:22,219
Stop it!

142
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,867
M-Myia!!

143
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,331
No!!

144
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:36,240
No! Don't die!
Please don't die!

145
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:38,508
You... Your voice returned?!

146
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:40,573
So you did heal.

147
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:01,630
Is that man so important?

148
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:07,070
Pathetic!

149
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,236
Go wherever you want!

150
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:17,245
If he's lucky,
he may be saved.

151
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:21,649
Are you alright?! Hang on!

152
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:38,969
That's coming from the
direction of Casius' house!

153
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,134
Casius!!

154
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:47,212
Casius! Hang on!

155
00:22:50,217 --> 00:22:51,445
W-where am I...?

156
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,650
This is my mansion.
Myia brought you all the way here.

157
00:22:57,324 --> 00:23:00,293
M-My... ia? Myia!

158
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:05,530
I... I...

159
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,133
Myia...

160
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:11,460
I wanted to... have your child.

161
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:17,567
Myia... Myia!!

162
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:24,547
I was ready to take any punishment
for failing my mission,

163
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,846
but it seemed as if I
was only a distraction.

164
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:33,618
Someone had somehow gotten the
information back to my country.

165
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:39,655
This later became known as
the Eastern Seven Year War.

166
00:26:47,754 --> 00:26:48,743
Myia.

167
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:55,028
Cecilia.

168
00:27:01,868 --> 00:27:02,857
Bianca.
