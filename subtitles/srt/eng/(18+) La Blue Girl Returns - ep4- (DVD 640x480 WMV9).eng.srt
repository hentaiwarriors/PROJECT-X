1
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:16,644
Miss Miko!

2
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,483
I'm Kanako, Miss Miko.

3
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:22,955
Miss Miko?!

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,385
What are you going to do, Maho?

5
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,522
Are you going to leave Miko Mido alone?

6
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:36,662
No. Anyone who tries to get
near the Shikima brain...

7
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:39,729
...I cannot let alone,
no matter who they are.

8
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,969
I'll lure her into the usual place,
and eliminate her.

9
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:52,518
Yaku, I want you to tune into
Fubuki's hallucinatory dream.

10
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,350
This is an emergency.

11
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:58,153
If the torment of this hallucinatory
dream continues much longer...

12
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,750
...she'll be damaged psychologically.

13
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:12,769
I'm going to cum...
I'm going to cum...

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,630
I'm going to cum!

15
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,074
Miko!

16
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,408
Maho...

17
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,828
Fubuki...

18
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,231
Now, Yaku...

19
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,601
...I want you to tune into Fubuki's
hallucinatory dream.

20
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:21,369
By synchronizing Fubuki's
non-REM brainwaves...

21
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,603
...with Yaku's brainwaves...

22
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:25,942
...you will enter the same
hallucinatory dream...

23
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,038
...and will be able to rescue her.

24
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,207
All right.

25
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:50,034
So, this is Fubuki's hallucinatory dream?

26
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,868
No!

27
00:02:56,077 --> 00:02:57,135
No, please...!

28
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:00,772
Please stop this!

29
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,782
Fubuki!

30
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,216
Carnal awakening!

31
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,703
Wh-Who the hell are you?!

32
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:36,683
Thanks, Yaku!

33
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,349
Miko!

34
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,894
Are you all right, Miko! Wake up!

35
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:52,796
Yaku...

36
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:53,993
We have interference.

37
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:57,231
The ones we called are gone.
We might as well disappear.

38
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,537
Miko!

39
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,508
What's going on here?

40
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,838
Where are we?

41
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,607
I was taken by Maho and...

42
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,671
...and I ended up here when I woke up.

43
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,048
This is Fubuki's hallucinatory dream.

44
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,919
I came here to bring you back.

45
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,890
That's when Miko...

46
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,220
Miko.

47
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,824
I'm sorry that had to happen to you...

48
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:24,956
...considering I'm here with you.

49
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,199
How did you bring Miko here?

50
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:30,293
Fubuki?

51
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,535
Yaku?

52
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,699
Fubuki and Yaku are gone!

53
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,075
There's nothing to worry about, Miko.

54
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,274
They just woke up from
the hallucinatory dream.

55
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,476
They're probably back
in the real world now.

56
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:47,020
Awoke from the hallucinatory dream?

57
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:50,079
Isn't this Fubuki's hallucinatory dream?

58
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,886
Why did you bring me here?

59
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,622
What on earth are you doing, Maho?

60
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,260
Miko...

61
00:04:57,331 --> 00:05:00,858
Anyway, let's go purify our bodies
in the nearby spring.

62
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:03,301
I'll tell you everything then.

63
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,966
Maho?

64
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:12,177
You've awakened. It was a success.

65
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:14,214
Thank goodness.

66
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,976
There's big trouble, Kanako.

67
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,816
For some reason Miko has been
left in the hallucinatory dream.

68
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,355
What?! Miko is...?!

69
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:23,890
That's strange.

70
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:28,258
If she was in Fubuki's dream, she should've
disappeared when she woke up.

71
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:32,197
Which would mean that
it's not caused by her...

72
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:36,862
...but rather that she wandered
into someone else's dream.

73
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,864
In any case, we have to rescue Miko!

74
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,309
Doctor, please put me
into a dream state again.

75
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,677
Unfortunately, that's impossible.

76
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:50,282
We don't know whose dream it is.

77
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:54,651
I was able to trace Fubuki's
brainwaves to synchronize, but...

78
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,384
If only Miko was here...

79
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,085
...we'd be able to catch her brainwaves...

80
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,626
What?!

81
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,855
Then, Miko is...

82
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,955
Miko...

83
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,274
What a strange spring.

84
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:24,306
I feel like my filthy body
and spirit are being cleansed.

85
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,950
Now, tell me, Maho.

86
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:29,284
Where are we?

87
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,120
This is a hallucinatory dream.

88
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,854
The dream within the Shikima brain.

89
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:37,693
The dream within the Shikima brain?

90
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,665
Maho, what are you...?

91
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,692
First of all, I'll get us
something to wear.

92
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:46,763
Being like this could
become a distraction.

93
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,409
We'll have a long talk about this later.

94
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,968
Maho...

95
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,281
How would he know about
the Shikima brain?

96
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,250
Who on earth is Maho?

97
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:02,648
And what is that image that
appears in the back of my mind?

98
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,932
Miko...! Miko isn't coming back...!

99
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,173
My precious Miko!

100
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,042
The reason Fubuki was drawn
into the hallucinatory dream...

101
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,048
...should be hidden in this computer.

102
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,983
If we check it thoroughly, I'm sure...

103
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,679
There! I knew it!

104
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,816
It's set up so that the computer
activates it...

105
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,883
...after someone's been accessing
the web long enough.

106
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,556
But who can set up
a web site like that?

107
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,597
The guy who's with her right now!

108
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,399
Miko's...! Miko's in trouble!

109
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,138
You're making too much noise!

110
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:56,233
Just cut it out, Nin-Nin.

111
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,684
Ruri?

112
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:10,121
What are you doing here?

113
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,889
I thought is was strange my brother
left in the middle of the night.

114
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:19,126
I was following him, and I
wandered into this place.

115
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,032
As I wandered around,
I spotted you.

116
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,002
Is that right?

117
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,936
Where's my brother?

118
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,134
Maho said he was going off
to get some clothes.

119
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,939
Oh, perfect timing, then.

120
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,071
Now's our chance to get it over with.

121
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,244
Ruri?

122
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,004
But why, Ruri?

123
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:10,243
You're in the way.

124
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:14,276
That's why I want you to be
a prisoner of pleasure.

125
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:17,323
Huh? A prisoner of pleasure?

126
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,893
Ruri... What will happen to me...?

127
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,107
N-No...!

128
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,444
I'll tell you something interesting.

129
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,609
If you can cum in this place....

130
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,949
In this spring of carnal pleasure...

131
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,750
...you will be wandering in a state
of pleasure for eternity.

132
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,731
Ruri, I can't take it anymore.

133
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,498
I'm going to... I'm going to...

134
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,801
You can cum, Miko Mido.

135
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:10,674
Cum and become a prisoner
of the spring of carnal pleasure.

136
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:20,382
Oh, no... I'm going to...
I'm going to cum...!

137
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:29,695
- Ruri?
- Maho...

138
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,664
Miko Mido is now a prisoner
of the spring of carnal pleasure.

139
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,657
If you leave her there...

140
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,602
...her soul will wander aimlessly
for eternity...

141
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,105
...in the dream of the Shikima brain.

142
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:42,540
Isn't that great, Maho?

143
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,817
What happened to me?

144
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,688
Ruri cast a spell on you...

145
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,421
...and you became a prisoner of
this spring of carnal pleasure.

146
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,953
You were about to be sealed away
in here for eternity.

147
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,693
Ruri did?!

148
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:45,360
Ruri and I are descendents of a clan
that protects the Shikima brain.

149
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:49,205
You and Ruri are from a clan that
protects the Shikima brain?

150
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,302
That's right. All those who
approach the Shikima brain...

151
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,472
...for whatever reasons...

152
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,812
...I lure into this hallucinatory dream...

153
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,249
...and seal them away forever.

154
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,345
That is the duty of our clan...

155
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,684
...and our reason to exist.

156
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:07,488
Then, the one who lured Fubuki
into this place...

157
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,223
...and the one who
brought me here was...

158
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:14,400
If that's the case,
then why did you save me?

159
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,835
That's because you and I...

160
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,964
...are lovers from long ago...

161
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,838
...who were reborn into this world.

162
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,343
You and I were...

163
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,279
...lovers in a past life?

164
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,839
Miko. Look at this.

165
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,043
Try to remember.

166
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,986
Clothes you wore in a previous life.

167
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,821
Clothes I wore in a previous life...

168
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,037
Are you all right?

169
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,478
Thank you very much.

170
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,388
We fell in love with each other
that instant.

171
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,452
Who is it?

172
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:19,294
Good morning.

173
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,296
Wh-What's the matter?

174
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,596
Try and catch me!

175
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,432
All right!

176
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,200
I'll give you something nice
if you can catch up to me.

177
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,135
I'm going to get you!

178
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,182
Well, I caught up to you.

179
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,447
Then, I'll give you something good.

180
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:50,392
I didn't know that you were
the daughter of the Mido clan...

181
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:53,433
...whose duty was to search
for the Shikima brain...

182
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,990
...until that day.

183
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:07,144
Why? Why do you have to be
the daughter of the Mido clan?!

184
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,042
Why?!

185
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,208
What about you?!

186
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:15,482
Why do you have to be from a clan
that protects the Shikima brain?!

187
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,523
When we are born again
in another life...

188
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,069
...we will meet again...

189
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,102
No matter how many times
we are reborn, definitely...

190
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,074
...we'll meet again...

191
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,001
I'm sure... Definitely...

192
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:55,060
No matter how many times
we are reborn, definitely...

193
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,157
We finally meet again, but...

194
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,723
...this has to happen again...

195
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:03,497
Maho...

196
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,739
Miko...

197
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:36,332
I'm shy... Please don't look, Maho.

198
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,665
Why?

199
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,638
You're beautiful.

200
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,803
Maho...

201
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,038
I'm shy...

202
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,658
Maho... Maho...

203
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,396
Please don't tease my nipples.

204
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:14,337
Miko, look at you now...

205
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,737
You mustn't lick down there!

206
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,610
It's dirty! Maho!

207
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,762
Maho, I want you now.

208
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,025
Okay, Miko.

209
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,969
Th-This is the first time
I've been with a man, so...

210
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,298
...please be gentle.

211
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,400
I know, Miko.

212
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,040
Maho! I love you! I love you!

213
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,312
Miko! Miko!

214
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:13,462
Maho, I'm going to...

215
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,559
I'm going to cum!

216
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,466
I'm cumming!

217
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:31,873
Miko...

218
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:33,419
Maho...

219
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,148
We've finally become one...

220
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,884
...after being reborn.

221
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,826
I'm so happy.

222
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,986
Miko...

223
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,398
Miko...

224
00:17:57,711 --> 00:17:59,702
What are you going to do, Kanako?

225
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,977
I enter the dream through
the same route...

226
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,143
...and go and rescue Miss Miko!

227
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,312
What? That's dangerous, Kanako!

228
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:12,415
Don't worry. I'll be sure
to rescue Miss Miko.

229
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,424
Kanako...

230
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,043
Good luck, Kanako.

231
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:55,331
I hope this sacrifice will
open up the passage.

232
00:18:55,402 --> 00:19:00,305
Who knows. But at least
we can have fun with her.

233
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:06,102
Is this Miss Miko's hallucinatory dream?

234
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:52,517
No! Miko! Help me!

235
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,067
Hey, Maho...

236
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:06,833
What was that attacking Fubuki before?

237
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:10,205
They are the zombie demons of those...

238
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,210
...who sought the Shikima brain.

239
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,905
Zombie demons?

240
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:19,542
They sacrifice any woman
that comes their way.

241
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,580
Sacrifice?

242
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,680
In order to open a passage
to the Shikima brain...

243
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:28,194
...they must sacrifice the women
who are thought to be...

244
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:31,059
...the descendents of the Shikima.

245
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:33,793
Descendents of the Shikima?

246
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:38,998
That's right. By sacrificing the
women of the descendent clan.

247
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,271
N-No! Stop!

248
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:50,783
I already decided Miss Miko
was going to be the first!

249
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:56,084
No!

250
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:01,723
This woman! She is from the clan
of Shikima descendents!

251
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:05,390
It will open! The passage
to the Shikima brain!

252
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,168
Wake up, Kanako.

253
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,228
Were you able to rescue Miko?

254
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,797
I wasn't able to rescue Miko.

255
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,503
But something terrible has happened!

256
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:22,070
The passage leading to the
Shikima brain has opened!

257
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,877
What?!

258
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,887
Fubuki, we must use our magic
and go to the Shikima realm.

259
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:33,016
Right. We have to inform
the Shikima King.

260
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,899
This has to be the pleasure
center of this world.

261
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,083
I'm going to... I'm cumming!

262
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,084
Me, too... I'm cumming!

263
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:42,021
I'm cumming... I'm cumming!

264
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,726
Wh-What's this vibration?!

265
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,166
Shikima King!

266
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,966
Yaku! And even Fubuki!

267
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,064
Something terrible has happened, King!

268
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:58,167
The passage leading to the
Shikima brain has opened!

269
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,609
What?!

270
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,615
I see. That explains this convulsion
in the Shikima realm.

271
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,514
And Miko hasn't returned...

272
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:09,385
...from the dream we went into
to solve that mystery!

273
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:10,786
What should we do?!

274
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:15,294
But, now that the passage to the
Shikima brain has been opened...

275
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:18,762
...we cannot abandon
the Shikima realm.

276
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,459
I'm sure Miko can manage well.

277
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:22,728
Wh-What?!

278
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,827
What'll happen to Miss Miko?!

279
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,030
King...?

280
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:30,464
I'm sorry Miko. I hope you're safe.

281
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:32,911
Miko...

282
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,151
The passage leading to the
Shikima brain is opening up!

283
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,450
What?!

284
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,693
Don't tell me one of
the women sacrificed...

285
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,662
...was from the clan of
Shikima descendents!

286
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:57,136
The passage leading to the
Shikima brain has opened!

287
00:23:57,203 --> 00:24:01,037
We shall gain the power
to control the universe!

288
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,837
We can now cross time and space...

289
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,539
...and manipulate the passions
of all people at will!

290
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,739
No.

291
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:12,478
At this rate those demons will
flood into the Shikima brain.

292
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,152
Maho!

293
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,302
Who is that?!

294
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:35,341
And we're so close
to the Shikima brain.

295
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:38,377
We must do everything
to break through!

296
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,383
Maho!

297
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,258
Maho!

298
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:00,794
Maho...

299
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:03,028
Maho, you can do it!

300
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:06,094
Miko, listen to me.

301
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:09,437
The Shikima brain has awakened.

302
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,739
The Shikima brain has awakened?

303
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:15,679
That's right. Now that the Shikima
brain has awakened...

304
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,683
...this hallucinatory dream
will soon disappear.

305
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,218
Miko...

306
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:24,154
You've got to go to the Shikima realm
and protect the Shikima brain.

307
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:26,953
No! I have to save you first!

308
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:32,987
It's too late for me.
I'll disappear with this dream.

309
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:36,261
I doubt I'll be reborn again.

310
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:39,736
No. Please, Maho!
You've got to pull through!

311
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:45,437
I'm so happy that I was able
to be with you in the end.

312
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:49,538
But loving each other,
rather than killing each other.

313
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:56,545
Maho...? Maho!

314
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:16,774
After being reborn...

315
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:20,006
...and finally meeting again...

316
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,706
Maho... Maho!
