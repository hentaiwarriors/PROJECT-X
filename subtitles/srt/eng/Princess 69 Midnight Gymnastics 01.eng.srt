<i>Princess 69 - Midnight
Gymnastics Vol. 1</i>

2
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,730
Sis!

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,740
Miku-nee, wake up! lt's me, Fubuki!

4
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,980
What did you think of my performance?

5
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,750
How many points would you give me?

6
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,490
Sis...

7
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,990
Well? Are you surprised?

8
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,990
This is the ''Midnight Gymnastics.''

9
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,400
''Midnight Gymnastics?''

10
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,670
''Midnight Gymnastics...''

11
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,340
Women compete by displaying their beauty and sluttiness.

12
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,170
lt's a secret event that's more extreme than...

13
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,770
...your regular gymnastics event.

14
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,450
What exactly is that?

15
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,620
Ordinary people like you wouldn't know about it.

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,450
Celebrities like myself are the only ones who can view these events.

17
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,620
But l really feel sorry for Miku.

18
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,260
Tomomi-san, what happened to Miku-nee?

19
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,200
Miku was training very hard everyday.

20
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,300
But she was caught by the darkness of Midnight Gymnastics.

21
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,300
Darkness?

22
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,470
l couldn't tell this to anyone.

23
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,300
That's why l'm taking care of her at this mansion.

24
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,180
l understand.

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,610
Thank you so much.

26
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,310
l was worried since she disappeared all of a sudden.

27
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,380
But l didn't know she was in such a mess.

28
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,490
ls she going to be okay?

29
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,490
There's only one way to save Miku, but it will be difficult for you.

30
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Please tell me! What should l do?

31
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,330
l'll do anything to save my sister.

32
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,630
l can withstand anything.

33
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,800
l see. Then take your clothes off.

34
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,500
What?

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,110
Take off all your clothes!

36
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,480
What's wrong?

37
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,110
You're willing to do anything right?

38
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,460
Take your hands out of the way.

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,130
But...

40
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,460
Hurry!

41
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,840
Not bad for a cute-looking guy like yourself.

42
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,300
Ouch!

43
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,780
Hey Miku, take a look at this.

44
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,420
That...

45
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,260
l want that too...

46
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,390
Sis...

47
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,560
l really want this..

48
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,740
Stop it, Sis!

49
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,410
Don't worry about it. lt's not like you two are related by blood.

50
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,350
You two are not related, right?

51
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,580
But, but...

52
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,350
Tomomi-san...

53
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,240
l'm coming...

54
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,540
l'm coming, Sis...

55
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,320
Sis!

56
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,200
l can't believe you're still hard.

57
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,980
How does it feel?

58
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,650
lt feels so good, l think l'm gonna melt.

59
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,360
Me too...

60
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,310
l'm coming, l'll climax...

61
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,680
Tomomi-san...

62
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,690
Do it. Release it inside me!

63
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,420
l'm coming, l'm coming!

64
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,720
Fubuki Haneoka, l'm appointing you to be the coach of Midnight Gymnastics.

65
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,320
This is Miku-nee's...

66
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,420
l want you to teach them a lesson as their coach.

67
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,970
And find out how to rescue your sister from the darkness.

68
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,330
That's the only way.

69
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,560
l understand.

70
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,340
l'll do it!

71
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,350
l'm Tomomi Shirakawa, daughter of the head of Shirakawa enterprises.

72
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,690
Shirakawa Academy, that my grandfather has established...

73
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,590
...was designed specifically for me.

74
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,660
l can do whatever l want.

75
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,800
So l can get Miku's younger brother...

76
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:44,140
...Fubuki into the school dressed up like a girl.

77
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,380
Midnight Gymnastics...

78
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,780
l already had a target, Koyuki Fujimiya.

79
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,050
She has talent.

80
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,380
l'm sure of it.

81
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,830
Ouch!

82
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,860
You're very stiff, Haneoka!

83
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,400
l'm not used to gymnastics.

84
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,940
l doubt that.

85
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,410
You're a tomboy, Haneoka.

86
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,080
We don't see people like you in gymnastics...

87
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,810
Of course we don't.

88
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,580
She's a guy.

89
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,650
What are you saying?

90
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,150
lt's weird that she has no boobs.

91
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,590
So what?

92
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,020
lt's better to have small boobs in gymnastics.

93
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,590
Right? Haneoka-san?

94
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,560
You two boobless girls get along well, huh?

95
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,760
What did you say?

96
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,600
You!

97
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,130
Excuse me...

98
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,400
But why is Koyuki-chan doing nothing?

99
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,830
Other girls dislike her.

100
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,440
Why?

101
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,780
The Manager's followers think she's associated with Shirakawa-san.

102
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,080
When the manager's not here, they all treat her bad.

103
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,680
But that's just wrong!

104
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,460
Haneoka-san!

105
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,180
Hey, it's starting to get interesting.

106
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,020
Please let Fujimiya-san practice!

107
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,490
What did you say?

108
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,000
That's none of your business newbie.

109
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,470
But she's one of your members.

110
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,670
She's one of Shirakawa-san's.

111
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,970
Do whatever you want.

112
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,740
l will.

113
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,780
Let's go.

114
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,880
But if you do this, you will...

115
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,980
lt's okay.

116
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,220
Way to go Haneoka-san!

117
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,250
That was cool!

118
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,250
Yep, only if she had bigger boobs.

119
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,880
Thank you.

120
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,990
Now let's practice.

121
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
You're very kind.

122
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,070
Tomomi-san!

123
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,240
But you're dying to use this right?

124
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,640
Not here...

125
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,740
What's wrong?

126
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,210
Tell her you're getting hard.

127
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,580
l can't!

128
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,650
Nothing. Carry on.

129
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,650
This is bad...

130
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,250
What's wrong with her?

131
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,290
l think she's not feeling well.

132
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,270
Fubuki-chan?

133
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,940
Did you throw up?

134
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,980
Yeah, but l'm okay now.

135
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,810
Take it easy.

136
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,820
Why don't you lie down?

137
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,990
l'll wash it for you.

138
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:16,990
Koyuki-chan...

139
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,570
What's wrong?

140
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,740
l'm sorry for making you wash that.

141
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,010
lt's okay. You helped me out earlier.

142
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,620
See? lt's all clean.

143
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,790
Thanks.

144
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,930
This leotard was used by this academy not too long ago.

145
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,660
Yeah, it's my sister's.

146
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,200
Your sister was into gymnastics too?

147
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,830
ls she still doing it?

148
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,630
Well, she's kind of sick right now...

149
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,630
l'm sorry, l shouldn't have asked.

150
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,370
You don't have to apologize.

151
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,920
Tomomi-san didn't come to practice today either.

152
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,760
She's a genius, so she doesn't need any practice.

153
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,700
Tomomi-san's a genius?

154
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,230
She told me.

155
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,130
l'm sure she is.

156
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,360
There's Tomomi-san.

157
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,940
Who are they?

158
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,240
Her fans.

159
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,800
Fans?

160
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,900
From her fan club.

161
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,050
l don't really know the details, but l heard she has lots of fans...

162
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,340
...from several different schools.

163
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,940
l didn't know she was so popular.

164
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,950
She's pretty and good at gymnastics, but she seems lonely.

165
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,260
What?

166
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,450
Nothing.

167
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,420
lf you need anything, just let me know.

168
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,400
l will.

169
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,330
You know Fubuki-chan, l...

170
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,130
What?

171
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,400
Well, see you tomorrow.

172
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,110
Attention please.

173
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,170
Fubuki Haneoka of the gymnastics club.

174
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,480
Fubuki Haneoka of the gymnastics club.

175
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,190
Please come to the principal's office.

176
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,290
Excuse me.

177
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,430
l'm Fubuki Haneoka.

178
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,480
You're late.

179
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,290
Tomomi-san? What are you doing here?

180
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,200
My grandfather is the principal of this academy.

181
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,740
This is his room, so this room belongs to me.

182
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,770
Got it?

183
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,210
What?

184
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,780
You don't feel comfortable being in a small classroom right?

185
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,950
But...

186
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,950
Never mind that!

187
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,780
What's going on with Koyuki Fujimiya?

188
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,820
Nothing l'm afraid.

189
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,450
But l can't see how she has the talent...

190
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,820
...to compete in the ''Midnight Gymnastics.''

191
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,800
What about Miku? Was she talented?

192
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,000
Then mind your own business.

193
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:13,790
Yes.

194
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,800
But you need a break once in a while.

195
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,470
You saw it didn't you?

196
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,010
No, it's just...

197
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,770
Get up here.

198
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,180
But what if someone comes in?

199
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,410
l told you this is my room, you chicken.

200
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,020
Principal's Office

201
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,020
lt looks funny every time.

202
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,810
What a weirdo.

203
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,460
What do you want to do?

204
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,920
l want to stick it inside you.

205
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,020
Stupid!

206
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:47,930
Ouch!

207
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,360
Remember what you're doing.

208
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,460
You're saving Miku, right?

209
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,430
l know.

210
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,040
You masturbate by thinking of me right?

211
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,310
Well, l...

212
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,040
Tell me the truth.

213
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,050
You think of me when you masturbate.

214
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,160
Yes, l think of you when l masturbate.

215
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,230
And how many times do you masturbate each day?

216
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,230
Twice.

217
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,430
Then l wonder how many times you'll masturbate today...

218
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,230
Since this will be your first one.

219
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,910
Okay, we're done.

220
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,240
Make sure to clean that up.

221
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,950
And make sure to clean this room everyday.

222
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,880
Tomomi-san.

223
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,540
What is it?

224
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,450
l saw you the other day at the station.

225
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,060
Where did you go when you were skipping practice?

226
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,630
Mind your own business.

227
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,830
Tomomi-san...

228
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,600
The movie l saw the other day was really good.

229
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,180
No, stop it!

230
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,420
That's Tomomi-san!

231
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,580
Who are you people?

232
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,410
We used to be part of Tomomi's fan club, but we just quit.

233
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,580
l was pissed off by her attitude.

234
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,590
She's so cute!

235
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,360
Look at those nice white panties!

236
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,120
No!

237
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,600
Let me see your tits!

238
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,400
Smells good!

239
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,000
No!

240
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,230
Stop!

241
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,330
Stop it!

242
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,200
Stop!

243
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,140
Stop!

244
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,980
l'm begging you!

245
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,180
Stop! Stop it, stop it!

246
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,540
Koyuki-chan!

247
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,420
Let me go!

248
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,180
Hey, this one's a male!

249
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,480
Really?

250
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,620
Let's take a look!

251
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,920
What the hell?

252
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,400
He's dressed like a girl and goes to an all-girls' school?

253
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,620
Stupid!

254
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,430
Fubuki-chan...

255
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,640
Hey, let's have this guy rape that girl!

256
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,100
A pervert sneaks into a prestigious academy and rapes a fellow student!

257
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,210
This scandal will be great!

258
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,610
Why should l do such a thing?

259
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,950
lf you don't do it, then we will.

260
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,250
Smells good!

261
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,950
Stop, stop...

262
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,050
Fubuki!

263
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,160
You really want these animals to violate Fujimiya?

264
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,320
Tomomi-san...

265
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,760
lf you think about it, it's better for her to be raped by you than them!

266
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,170
But these guys know who l am.

267
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,730
We can take care of that using my family's connections!

268
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,670
But you won't be able to take away her emotional pain!

269
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,300
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

270
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,050
You're willing to do it now?

271
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,750
Koyuki-chan...

272
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,350
Ready?

273
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,810
l'm coming, l'm coming!

274
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,840
l'm coming, l'm coming!

275
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,480
l'm coming, l'm coming, l'm coming!

276
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,860
Good job!

277
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,370
Tomomi-san...

278
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,870
What is this?

279
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,470
You wouldn't make a move, so l just simply helped you.

280
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,470
What? You tricked me?

281
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,370
What are you saying?

282
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,880
l'm just worried since l felt you forgot about Miku!

283
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,680
What?

284
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,910
You do it when you have to.

285
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,650
That's what l expected from a coach of ''Midnight Gymnastics''...

286
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,230
l was never wrong about you.

287
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,430
Fujimiya-san, you're going to help us too, right?

288
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,430
You can't say no, since l have this.

289
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,950
l'm the leading actress in this world.

290
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,920
The rest of them are just supporting actors.

291
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,420
l have the power to do anything l want.

292
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,660
Even the things that are going to happen from here on.

293
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,940
Hey, stop slacking off!

294
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,850
Koyuki-chan!

295
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,220
You helped me out twice already.

296
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:50,810
Twice?

297
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,620
First, you helped me from the other bullying members.

298
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,700
Second, what you did the other day...

299
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,630
<i>But l raped you...</i>

300
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,560
l'm glad you did it.

301
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,800
lf you didn't, those men would've.

302
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,630
But...

303
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,430
You did what you had to do.

304
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,440
l'm sorry l pretended to be a girl.

305
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,210
l still can't believe it... That you were a boy.

306
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,540
l was very surprised.

307
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,450
But now, l feel very determined.

308
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,450
What?

309
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:25,560
l was asked by Shirakawa-san if l wanted to take part in ''Midnight Gymnastics''

310
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,360
At the time, l didn't know what it was, so l refused since l was scared.

311
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,470
Tomomi-san likes you, Koyuki-chan.

312
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,230
What about you, Fubuki-chan?

313
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,230
What?

314
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,230
Do you like me?

315
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,270
Yeah, from the first time l saw you.

316
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,540
Thanks.

317
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,850
lf l'm with you Fubuki-chan...

318
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,880
But Koyuki-chan...

319
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,450
lt's okay, l've already decided.

320
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:55,450
You have your reasons for coming here dressed up like a girl, right?

321
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,580
Does it have something to do with your sick sister?

322
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,990
lf l can solve your problems by participating, l'll do it.

323
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,730
l'll do Midnight Gymnastics.

324
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,030
Koyuki-chan...

325
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,030
l like you Fubuki-chan.

326
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,640
lf you take part in Midnight Gymnastics, there's no going back.

327
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,940
Plus if you're caught by the darkness...

328
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,040
l'll stick by you no matter what.

329
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,050
lt'll be fun working with you, coach.

330
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:42,060
Today's the first day, so l'll check your body and your sensitivity.

331
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,740
Plus don't forget, this is practice for Midnight Gymnastics.

332
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,070
We're not playing games.

333
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,900
Yes.

334
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,810
l want you to relax.

335
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,710
Looks like your leotard is on pretty tight.

336
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,080
l'll make you feel comfortable.

337
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,680
Feels much better right?

338
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,400
Very elastic.

339
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,370
How about over here?

340
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,380
You're sweating down here.

341
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,080
No, don't say that.

342
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,950
No, l'm screaming out loud.

343
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,400
lt's embarrassing.

344
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,540
Pretty.

345
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,070
Your crotch is all wet and shiny.

346
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,500
No...

347
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,540
You shouldn't be embarrassed.

348
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,810
But...

349
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,010
Delicious.

350
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,180
Your cunt is exposed.

351
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,830
lt's embarrassing.

352
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,460
Suck on this.

353
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,970
Open your eyes Koyuki-chan!

354
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,710
Open your eyes!

355
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,480
l know your weakness.

356
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,810
You get excited easily.

357
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,650
But you can't express your sensations to the public.

358
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,490
That's why you're not smiling.

359
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,560
l'm just embarrassed.

360
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,990
That's unacceptable!

361
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,600
Women compete by displaying their beauty...

362
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,960
...and sluttiness in Midnight Gymnastics.

363
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,570
lf you can't express your feelings to the public, you can never win!

364
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,640
Don't be afraid to smile!

365
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,570
We'll work on that smile of yours from here on!

366
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,780
l'll go as hard as l can.

367
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,220
No!

368
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,260
Smile! Smile for me!

369
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,210
No! Not yet!

370
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,610
Smile! Come on!

371
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,850
That's it.

372
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,560
That's what you have to show the audience!

373
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,870
Your strong feelings when you endure pain...

374
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,030
Joy you get from pleasure.

375
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,740
Express the feelings you get when we connect with each other.

376
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,250
l'm sure you can do it.

377
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,040
l want to be honest with my feelings.

378
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,580
l'm coming, l'm coming, Koyuki-chan!

379
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,060
l'm coming too!

380
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,070
l'm coming, l'm coming, l'm coming, l'm coming, l'm coming!
