1
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,253
This is all madness.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,763
What the hell has happened...

3
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,266
...to this peaceful town?

4
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,553
That woman...

5
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:45,968
IMMA YOUJO

6
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,442
What's that tower for?

7
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,975
How cute...

8
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,548
I guess you're homeless too?

9
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,420
That makes two of us.

10
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,160
My name is Maya.

11
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,534
Let's be friends.

12
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,003
You can be friends with us, too.

13
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,743
What do you want?

14
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,345
You look like you're new here.

15
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,314
I'll teach you the rules of this town.

16
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,989
Forget about the ugly cat.

17
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,852
Why don't we do something
more enjoyable, huh?

18
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,192
Ouch! What are you doing? Stupid cat!

19
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,263
You bitch!

20
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,256
Get her!

21
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,572
This feels good.

22
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,410
S- She's great...

23
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,926
W- What's with this girl?

24
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,217
Where am I?

25
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,519
What's going on?!

26
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:07,955
W- What's...

27
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,436
No!

28
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,211
So, you're awake?

29
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,117
Where am I?

30
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,353
Who are you?

31
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,154
My name is Halda.

32
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,099
I will take care of all your needs.

33
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,963
Once you have rested, I would
like you to begin your work here.

34
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:26,797
What?

35
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,306
You can take it easy for now.

36
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,410
You were sold to this place.

37
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,042
You were purchased as a
prostitute for this tower.

38
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,449
This is a house of pleasure.

39
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,183
Any and all kinds of pleasure
are made available here.

40
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,660
Our master is looking
forward to seeing you.

41
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:55,457
You were purchased for the highest
price this tower has ever spent.

42
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:24,522
Come in.

43
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,227
Here's your guest.

44
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,299
Enjoy her to your heart's content, Sir.

45
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,310
I assume you are new here.

46
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,175
You already forgot about me, Maya?

47
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,642
How come you know my name?

48
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,611
It's me, Chaos, remember?

49
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,079
You! Why on earth...?

50
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,783
I've been thinking about you a lot.

51
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,458
Don't tell me you were the one...

52
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:05,069
Don't be mistaken. I didn't sell you to this place.

53
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,126
Yeah, right.

54
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,706
Just because I had grudge against you,

55
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,936
doesn't mean I would do such a cowardly thing.

56
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,977
Still...

57
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,636
...I enjoyed watching how you got here.

58
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,516
That's bad enough!

59
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,312
Just go away! I don't
wanna even look at you.

60
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,050
I paid for your service.

61
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,625
That means you'll have to
give me my money's worth.

62
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:32,728
N- No!

63
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,390
Don't...

64
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,274
Have you seen the master of this tower?

65
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,673
N- No... I haven't.

66
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,642
The people in town haven't either, or rather...

67
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,441
...they don't want to talk about it.

68
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,778
Why do you wanna know
about things like that?

69
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,056
Something smells really fishy.

70
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,659
I have nothing to do with it.

71
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,693
You have been always like that.

72
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,973
There are strange things in this town.

73
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,912
I don't see any young women.
I only see girls and old women.

74
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,679
Why does...

75
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,745
...that bother you?

76
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,251
Don't you get it?

77
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:37,724
I figure all the young women
were forced to work in this tower.

78
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,668
Besides, all the men in this town...

79
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,897
...are either blind or...

80
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,107
...they're just too greedy to care.

81
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,538
They seem like they're scared of something.

82
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,380
I told you. It has nothing to do with me.

83
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,112
I figure this tower is hiding something.

84
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:06,482
When it comes to this tower,
the people here suddenly get quiet.

85
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,788
I have nothing to do with it...

86
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,931
I already told you.

87
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,759
Until I find out the secret of this tower,

88
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:41,420
I am going to come back quite often.

89
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,362
Besides, I've got some more
business with your body, too.

90
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,764
Don't come back!

91
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:50,898
See you soon.

92
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,727
You have gotten accustomed
to life here, I presume?

93
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,728
Maybe... I can enjoy good food here.

94
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,094
I don't like being forced
to sleep with men, but...

95
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,032
...as long as I put up with it,
this place seems pretty comfortable.

96
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:32,941
Tonight...

97
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,006
...the Master would like to
see you in his chambers.

98
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,451
Once a month, every woman in this tower...

99
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,819
...has the honor of being
tenderly loved by our Master.

100
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,823
Like a caged cat,
I don't have a choice, huh?

101
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,163
Our Master has been looking
forward to being with you...

102
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,128
...after last month.

103
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,930
After last month?

104
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:13,480
Hey Halda, I don't remember
meeting our Master last month.

105
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,452
You were unconscious when
you were first brought here.

106
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,961
This is the chamber that our
Master, Bazus, resides in.

107
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:42,537
Go right in. The Master is waiting for you.

108
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,759
The Master is this way.

109
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,198
Lord Bazus, here is the lady you so desire.

110
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,134
He's saying, "Come in. "

111
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,537
What are you doing?
Hurry up. Go right in.

112
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,321
No!

113
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,828
No! Don't!

114
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,144
N- No...

115
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,406
No!

116
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,234
So, how's business?

117
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,735
Shit. Just as unfriendly as ever.

118
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,779
The Master seemed so pleased to have you.

119
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,582
He favored you so much.

120
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,191
Can I really have it?

121
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,059
Certainly.

122
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,134
Hey. Is this all?

123
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,497
It's not what we agreed to.

124
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,376
Well then... take it or leave it.

125
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,444
What?!

126
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,415
You're taking advantage of us...

127
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,515
Alright, I get it.

128
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,302
Hey, good to see you again.

129
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,313
Relax and enjoy.

130
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,654
You didn't bring the cat?

131
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,453
No, I had some business to attend to.

132
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,349
I am beginning to understand
how this town works.

133
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,814
I like this much better.

134
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:45,163
Did you know that the people in this
town are all addicted to a drug...

135
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,063
...that the Master of this tower sells?

136
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,601
With all the profits they make,
they've bought a small army of guards.

137
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,951
I'm sorry, but our drug is not easy to produce.

138
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:17,156
This drug is not as cheap as you might think.

139
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,897
Ugh... This is terrible.

140
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:44,078
The drug they are producing is not
like any kind we have ever known.

141
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,458
By the way I see how people are addicted,

142
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:49,052
this must be a very powerful drug.

143
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,991
Hey, are you listening?

144
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,874
That man is quite dangerous.

145
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,176
We will turn him away next time he comes.

146
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,145
It's my job to sleep with men, isn't it?

147
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:15,704
Come here.

148
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,079
Now I've got it...

149
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:56,221
They process the thing
that monster ejaculates...

150
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:58,189
...and turn it into the drug.

151
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:02,315
That explains why I have never
seen anything like this before.

152
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,159
Still, it's a disgusting drug.

153
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,530
Stop right there, Chaos.

154
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,000
Hey...

155
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,439
It's just one sample out of so many? Can't I...?

156
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:15,405
No, you may not.

157
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,806
You are so inflexible.

158
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,606
I'm sorry, but they are very costly products.

159
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:25,776
We might be able to offer
you a discount, though.

160
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,316
I don't do drugs myself.

161
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,416
Particularly not after seeing where
this disgusting drug comes from.

162
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,414
What you mean is...

163
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,790
I didn't want to, but I happened to see it.

164
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,726
I saw you doing it with the master of the tower.

165
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:52,940
<i>My mind and body, everything
is yours, Lord Bazus.</i>

166
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,280
It was like watching a nightmare.

167
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,381
Shoot! Kill him!

168
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:03,782
Oops.

169
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,947
You cannot escape!

170
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:20,230
Don't let him go. Kill him!
Make sure he's dead!

171
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,689
Huh?

172
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,192
Get away from him!

173
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,597
His body fluid, which is being sent
underground, is going to back up.

174
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,498
The monster is going to explode soon.

175
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:55,331
What?

176
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,676
A face like yours doesn't scare me.

177
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:09,982
Give me the woman and make it quick.

178
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,558
Since you are about to explode,
I could just get her afterwards,

179
00:28:13,593 --> 00:28:15,355
but I am in a hurry.

180
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,985
I want get out of this town...

181
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:22,127
...and make some money from
this drug, so I can live with her.

182
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,165
Chaos...

183
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:43,818
Hold it!

184
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:50,321
I'm surprised that you escaped
into a place like this, Chaos.

185
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,891
I'm surprised you found me.

186
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,098
You must have been planning to...

187
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,702
That's right, Maya. It is all for you.

188
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,400
Something went wrong since you came here...

189
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,174
...with Lord Bazus and with myself!

190
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:10,940
Die!

191
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:29,297
Now, no one is in our way, Maya.

192
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,868
That's right. Everything is your fault, Maya.

193
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,476
Freeze!

194
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,546
Next time you move,
you'll be a dead man.

195
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,920
Right now, in front of you, I will rape her.

196
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,624
Then, I will slowly torture you to death.

197
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:56,755
W- What the...?

198
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,525
Stupid monster!

199
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,766
Take this!

200
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,304
Are you okay, Maya?

201
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,344
This woman is mine.

202
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,045
M... Maya...

203
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,055
Maya...

204
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,156
I won't let you go.

205
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,528
A woman and man have escaped.

206
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,034
Capture them!

207
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,235
Guard the front of our Lord's Chamber!

208
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,854
Maya... Come... back...

209
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,461
Who goes there? Stop!

210
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,927
Somebody's escaped!

211
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:14,968
Get them! Follow them!

212
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:22,971
What the...?

213
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,852
We're in trouble.

214
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:35,559
They've to decided to kill us,
rather than get back their drug.

215
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,792
No shit!

216
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:42,861
Maya...!

217
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,203
Damn! We're too late.

218
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:47,760
I will go myself.

219
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,107
Get my vehicle ready!

220
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:49,573
Yes sir.

221
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,109
I'll get Maya back.

222
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,813
What are we gonna do? We can't win.

223
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,456
Well then, let's go for broke!

224
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:12,987
What?!

225
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,920
Jeez! You drive like a maniac!

226
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,856
This is as far as you go!

227
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,151
Maya, you are quite a woman.

228
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,545
Maya!

229
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,476
Maya!

230
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,886
Maya!

231
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,795
Maya!

232
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,144
Mmm... it smells like the drug.

233
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,377
That monster smells of the drug.

234
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,752
Look! His blood is the drug!

235
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,828
Get out of way! Go away!

236
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,637
His body is full of the drug. Kill him!

237
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,275
Maya!

238
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,890
Maya!

239
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,857
And... push!

240
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,268
Maya.

241
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:14,739
What?

242
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,510
What's got into you all of the sudden?

243
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,477
Stop it, Chaos.

244
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,778
What's wrong with you, doing this now?

245
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,484
Nothing is wrong...

246
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,252
I just want to make love to you.

247
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,158
That must be it over there.

248
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,755
Okay. Stop around here.

249
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:36,390
Huh?
Huh?

250
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,365
I am going on alone, from this point.

251
00:36:59,016 --> 00:36:59,778
Maya...

252
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:01,380
Halda?!

253
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,649
Now, come with me.

254
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,260
Maya, don't go.

255
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,655
That man is finished.

256
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,430
It's my turn to take you away.

257
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,102
Maya...

258
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,605
Maya... What are you doing?

259
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,197
What?!

260
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:11,914
You!

261
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,056
Maya... I have found you.

262
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,762
Why?

263
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,799
That's...

264
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,727
Maya...

265
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:36,175
Stop it! Maya is mine!

266
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,126
<i>Any man who loves her, risks their life...</i>

267
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,960
<i>Vengeance? It's just the same as before.</i>

268
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:00,727
<i>When that woman came to my
town, everything changed.</i>

269
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:06,171
<i>The men became so horny,
they raped other men's lovers.</i>

270
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,241
<i>While all of that happened,
that woman was just smiled.</i>

271
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:11,979
<i>It's pathetic...</i>

272
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,544
<i>I can't hate her, however much I try to...</i>

273
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,278
<i>That monster is the same as me.</i>

274
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,123
<i>He can't resist that woman's body either.</i>

275
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,196
<i>Truly, men are such...</i>

276
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,198
Maya...

277
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,636
Get away from Maya! You ugly monster!

278
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,816
You are mine... Maya!

279
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,286
Maya!

280
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,324
So cute.

281
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,288
Maya. You are...

282
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,377
Excuse me. I hear there's
a town named Samgun...

283
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:40,582
Huh? Yeah, go straight
ahead and you can't miss it.

284
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,182
Thanks.
