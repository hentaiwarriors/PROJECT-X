1
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:15,517
This is great, Charlotte. You're so beautiful.

2
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:19,159
I'm sorry to wake you up so late.

3
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:22,422
I couldn't wait to tell you how I feel, Cain.

4
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:26,798
I'm in love with you.

5
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:30,302
Ever since I met you...

6
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:33,471
...it's like you've become a part of me.

7
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:36,339
And with each passing day...

8
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:39,372
...your hold over me continues to grow.

9
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:42,207
The reason I've become so ladylike...

10
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:45,052
...is because I was scared that you would hate me.

11
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:51,324
You're the only person who treats
me not as your queen...

12
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:54,127
...but like a real woman.

13
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,191
I really enjoy that.

14
00:00:58,836 --> 00:01:01,134
I've been watching you.

15
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:04,872
I've been thinking about you all the time.

16
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,273
Ah...I can trust you, can't l?.

17
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:12,541
Yes, you can, Charlotte. I love you.

18
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:18,345
Hold me tight. Don't leave. Please!.
I want you to be with me forever.

19
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:20,283
Yes. I'll be by your side forever.

20
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,759
Ah... I can't... I'm losing it...Ah...Ah...

21
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,476
Daddy...

22
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:01,997
Cain, you have to be the
most powerful...

23
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,033
Lord of a I l the
lands w i th i n the next five years.

24
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:07,264
Become someone loved and respected by the people.

25
00:02:07,604 --> 00:02:08,866
Yes, Princess Charlotte!.

26
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:13,833
Chiffon, I want you to stay and help Cain.

27
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:16,638
Yes. Anything her Majesty desires.

28
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:22,643
Alright. I'll come back and check
on you before too long.

29
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:26,388
Please, Princess. Come anytime.

30
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:31,015
Princess, It's time for us to be going.

31
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,453
I know.

32
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:39,667
So long.

33
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,479
Excuse me, Princess.

34
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,244
But do you really think that young man, Cain...

35
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:02,358
...is capable of becoming a powerful Lord?.

36
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,652
I don't know...

37
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:06,990
But I believe in him.

38
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:11,862
I have a feeling that the spirit of
Mother Earth will look down on him.

39
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:14,163
What makes you say that?.

40
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:18,964
I can smell it in the air.

41
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:25,911
I'm Cain Asbell, a shepherd.

42
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,919
One day, I followed some sheep
that had strayed off...

43
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:31,549
...into a cave, where I found a strange vase.

44
00:03:32,456 --> 00:03:36,449
From inside the vase came Elise.

45
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:39,895
A fairy who'd been trapped
for over a hundred years.

46
00:03:40,364 --> 00:03:41,991
She thanked me for setting her free.

47
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,291
She told me to go and check
out an abandoned cabin.

48
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:48,331
There I found a Princess, Charlotte of Franberge...

49
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:49,637
...who had been kidnapped by bandits.

50
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,938
I saved her life.

51
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:55,445
I was invited to the royal palace and
rewarded with the Lordship of Norland.

52
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:58,647
I was also chosen as one of the candidates
to become the princess' husband.

53
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:03,180
However, if I am unable to make my land the
most prosperous in the country in five years

54
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,052
I will lose not only my title of Lord...

55
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:07,784
But my chance at the princess' hand in marriage.

56
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:11,454
I still don't know if I should be happy or not.

57
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:14,659
But I have no choice but to do my best.

58
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:35,245
I give up!.

59
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:39,253
What's the matter, boys?. Finished already?.

60
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,051
I'll give 100 flange to anyone who can beat me.

61
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:47,225
Nobody else wants to take a shot?.

62
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:51,834
My challenge fee is only 2 flange!.

63
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:56,636
That look. She must be from the
Eastern lsland of Yapan

64
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:01,667
Hello!. Nobody wants to try?.

65
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:06,147
Hey, you there!. I see you
have a pretty nice sword.

66
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:07,775
Wanna test your skills?.

67
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:10,212
What are you doing here?.

68
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:12,847
I am Cain Asbell, Lord of this land.

69
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:15,690
You do not have permission to do this.

70
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:18,152
You won't get away with this if you keep it up.

71
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:22,129
Is that so?. Well, excuse me.
I didn't know you were the Lord.

72
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:29,265
But what do you mean that
I won't get away with it?.

73
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,967
This is great! Go, Sir Lord!
Show us your strength!

74
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:36,136
You're not thinking of running
away from a woman, are you?.

75
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,481
No. I just don't fight with women.

76
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:47,485
I wouldn't want to hurt her if I fought for real.

77
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:51,221
You should just hurry up and leave this place.

78
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:56,990
If you have such superior skills,
I would like to have the chance to fight you.

79
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,658
You don't need to worry about me.

80
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:04,498
AH...well. You see... I haven't... Umm...
practiced recently so...

81
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,775
I'm...kind of...Well, my sword
is...deadly.

82
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:09,038
My skills...Umm...
passed down in the family.

83
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:11,973
And...There are a lot of...rules involved so...

84
00:06:12,282 --> 00:06:15,774
You know...that kind of stuff...you know...well...

85
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:18,353
I'm telling you that I'll be fine!

86
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:20,354
Ah...well...

87
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:23,025
If you won't start this, I'll go first!

88
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,089
What?.! Wa...Wait a...

89
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:28,388
AH...AH...No! Listen!

90
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:30,858
I won't fight a woman...

91
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,158
MEN!

92
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:47,108
You! You'll get hurt,
if you don't fight back.

93
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:48,173
C'mon!! Stand up!

94
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:50,214
Or could it be...?.

95
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,912
Is that all you've got?.

96
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:57,585
Princess!

97
00:06:57,928 --> 00:06:59,225
Princess...

98
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:04,062
It's too dangerous!

99
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,032
You'll fall!

100
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:13,834
Love Escalation!

101
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:19,741
Princess Charlotte! What are you doing!

102
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:23,474
You'll die if you fall from there.

103
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,721
Shut up! I'm not Charlotte!

104
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:30,989
I am the mysterious Masked Knight!

105
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:32,692
Nooo!

106
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:34,222
Princess!

107
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:39,365
You, there! Ms.Tsubaki!

108
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:42,837
I won't let you pick on the weak!

109
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:45,302
If you're still looking for a fight...

110
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,504
Why don't you try your luck with me?.!

111
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:49,075
How fun!

112
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:53,204
Come on then, little girl!
Show me what you've got!

113
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:56,681
What?.! If you underestimate me
just because I'm young...

114
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:58,516
you're in for a world of pain!

115
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:00,847
People like you who disregard the law...

116
00:08:01,091 --> 00:08:03,821
will fall in seconds thanks to my special skills.

117
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,995
Come on then, little girl! Let's fight!!

118
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,967
Stop it, Charlotte! It's too dangerous!

119
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:18,271
Listen, everyone! Open your
eyes and watch what happens.

120
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,971
Here I come! YEAH!

121
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:26,044
Huh?.! She's fast, Well...

122
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:27,516
YEAH!

123
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:30,681
Take this!

124
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,385
DEADLY

125
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:34,086
LOVE

126
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:37,592
ESCALATlON

127
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:50,771
Charlotte!!

128
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:53,635
Is that all?.

129
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:55,836
Are you alright?.

130
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:01,709
She couldn't even be my sparring partner.

131
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:05,277
Just by looking at you sorry bunch of losers...

132
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:08,347
I can tell how weak the army here is.

133
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,187
You're not worthy opponents.

134
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,222
Do you understand?. Get out of my sight!

135
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:18,300
In this era, strength is the law of the land!

136
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:22,729
Cain...

137
00:09:23,073 --> 00:09:24,597
Charlotte! Are you Alright?.

138
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:31,738
Cain...The Law has nothing...
to do with strength.

139
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:37,016
The person here who can save
the people here from poverty

140
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:40,781
Someone with a generous heart like yours...

141
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,090
The power born from kindness and hope...

142
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,153
That is the law of this land!

143
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:51,733
Cain, have more confidence...

144
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:54,466
... in yourself.

145
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:56,502
I truly...

146
00:09:57,507 --> 00:09:58,997
... believe in...

147
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:02,143
...in you!

148
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,815
What a tearjerker that was!

149
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:11,451
I feel sorry for the people here...

150
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:13,413
...stuck with a Lord like you.

151
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:16,685
Come on! Show me what you're gonna do now!

152
00:10:21,464 --> 00:10:22,089
What?.

153
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:44,316
Cain!

154
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:02,929
I...I give up.

155
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:12,906
Ah... Umm...

156
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,450
Everyone, this is how strong the
power of love truly is.

157
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:22,822
AH...

158
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:27,129
You did great!

159
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:30,188
It's been a while since I slept that well.

160
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:50,585
She almost forced them to join her.

161
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,356
I wonder if they can become a
proper army like this?.

162
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:58,258
I heard a rumor from some of
the people training here...

163
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:03,856
...that The Emerald, a bandit group,
is hiding somewhere in our lands.

164
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,825
You made the right decision hiring her.

165
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:13,365
She said she'll work for free.

166
00:12:13,877 --> 00:12:17,210
Why not let her work a while and see how it goes?.

167
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:19,710
I guess so.

168
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:23,249
What did you say?.

169
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,285
That female bandit and her
men are hiding here!?.

170
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:32,927
Boss, please allow me to organize
the troops and go after them.

171
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:38,056
No. We haven't found out where their camp is yet.

172
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:43,596
And I can't send untrained men into danger just yet.

173
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:46,432
Then why don't you and I go?.

174
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:48,710
What!?. Just the two of us?.!

175
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:53,071
We'd be able to handle these
bandits without any problems.

176
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:56,477
No matter how many there are!

177
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,711
Don't be ridiculous!

178
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:07,325
What's wrong?. You look tired.

179
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:09,194
Hi, Elise.

180
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:11,063
It's about Tsubaki, right?.

181
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:16,067
Yeah. We have to be careful of
her aggressive personality.

182
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:20,407
I think Tsubaki just really wants
to help you out.

183
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,410
You know she's a very righteous person.

184
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,105
You're right.

185
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:28,911
I'll talk to her again tonight.

186
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:30,716
It'll be alright?.

187
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:32,346
Yeah, it'll be fine.

188
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,381
We just have slightly different
opinions, that's all.

189
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,028
She'll understand if I talk to her.

190
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:44,693
But I'm a little worried. She's very stubborn and...

191
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:51,771
Don't look so concerned.
Have a little faith in me...

192
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:53,837
Just let me handle this.

193
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:59,646
Why don't you go on night patrol?.

194
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:04,419
Alright, I'll do that, if you say so.
But don't upset her.

195
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:05,645
Don't worry.

196
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:09,881
We'll both be smiling and hugging
by tomorrow morning.

197
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,390
Alright then. Good luck.

198
00:14:14,263 --> 00:14:17,061
Yes?. Is that you, Tsubaki?. Come on in.

199
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:21,369
Welcome.

200
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:38,853
What's wrong?. Don't just stand
there. Please have a seat.

201
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:40,748
What's this about?.

202
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:45,120
Huh?. Don't shout! You'll wake everyone up!

203
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:46,860
What do you want?.

204
00:14:47,664 --> 00:14:49,598
What's wrong?. Are you upset?.

205
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,025
Of course.

206
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:54,600
I...I trusted you.

207
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:58,338
But after all I've done, you call me here for...

208
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:01,004
What?. What is it?.

209
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:02,941
...for SEX!

210
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:03,576
What!?.

211
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,512
You called me here for sex.

212
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:08,510
Don't make light of it.

213
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:10,719
I... It's not like that...

214
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:17,984
Then why would you ask a woman
to your room this late at night?.

215
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:24,623
Or did you call me just so you
could look at my face?.

216
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:28,933
It's not like that at all.

217
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:31,005
That was dumb of me.

218
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:36,411
I didn't think she would
misunderstand me inviting her like this.

219
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,340
Won't she just believe me and relax?.

220
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:46,312
I won't accept this, even if you are my boss.

221
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:51,024
Hey, Tsubaki. Why are you so nervous?.

222
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:55,860
Why...What?. I am not nervous!

223
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:57,763
If you don't need me, I'd like
to excuse myself.

224
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:01,400
What?. Hey...Wait a minute!

225
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,065
Why are you trying to avoid me?.

226
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:10,779
I...I'm not avoiding you.

227
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:14,279
You're lying! You're definitely avoiding me!

228
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:17,144
Why?. Tell me if I did something wrong.

229
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:21,986
You may work for me but I also
consider you a good friend.

230
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:25,019
I can't continue being your Lord if this continues.

231
00:16:33,436 --> 00:16:37,770
I'm worried rumors will spread about
my coming here late at night like this.

232
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:41,935
If that happened, I don't know
what I'd do. After all you've done for me

233
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:46,871
I...

234
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:51,920
I...I'm sorry, l...

235
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:28,017
What's wrong?.

236
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:30,320
They're here.

237
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,756
Who is?.

238
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:35,863
Those bandits...The Emerald.

239
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:37,297
What?.!

240
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,181
Hey! Hey! Hey! Fighting is fun! Nice to meet you!

241
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,983
If you don't want to get hurt,
just give us your money!

242
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:02,986
Once we've finished here, we move west!

243
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:04,454
OK, Sis!

244
00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:08,029
Idiot! I told you to call me Leader!

245
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:10,459
I...I'm sorry.

246
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:13,731
You there!

247
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,167
Huh?.

248
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:21,033
Leader, that's the new Lord here.

249
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:22,041
I see.

250
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:25,276
You're the bandit group,
The Emerald, aren't you?.

251
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:28,882
Stop this now and leave our lands!

252
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:32,284
So you're a comedian too?.

253
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:35,853
You should be more fun than the
Lord of that last town.

254
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:40,824
By the way, I am Sandra,
The Emerald's Leader.

255
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,990
Also, I don't like you referring
to us as bandits.

256
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,267
We prefer chivalrous thieves.

257
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:47,932
Chivalrous thieves?.

258
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,597
They just pretended to be noble.

259
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,901
They devastated our neighbors to the south.

260
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:55,976
It's rare to see a woman leader.

261
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:00,609
If you clean up this mess and leave us alone...

262
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:02,279
I will allow you to stay here.

263
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:08,053
You don't need to keep acting
like animals and committing these crimes!

264
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:13,158
Such thoughtful words. I'm so
happy I'm about to cry.

265
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:14,355
Yeah, right...

266
00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:21,196
Listen up, Sir Lord. We eat when
we want and we sleep when we want.

267
00:19:21,504 --> 00:19:23,768
We won't take orders from you.

268
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,939
Your words are only falling on deaf ears.

269
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:30,579
C'mon, Boss, why don't we...

270
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:33,777
No, Tsubaki. We need to size
them up more first.

271
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:36,182
Leave this one to me!

272
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:45,150
Hey, Sandra! You'll only end up
getting hurt if you underestimate us.

273
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:48,395
How about you and I settle
this, one on one?.

274
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:53,767
And if I win, you promise never
to set foot in this town again!

275
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:55,803
Leader, we should shut them up...

276
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:58,265
Well...wait a minute.

277
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:12,279
No need to get all hot and bothered!

278
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:16,013
We really just came to check
out the new Lord today.

279
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:19,056
But don't worry, you'll be
hearing from us again soon enough.

280
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:23,088
You're running away?. You cowards!

281
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:25,798
Don't be silly! I just don't feel like fighting today.

282
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:27,694
Come on, guys. Let's go.

283
00:20:27,903 --> 00:20:28,267
Yes, Leader!

284
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:28,902
I won't let you get away!

285
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:30,670
Stop, Tsubaki! Don't!

286
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:32,235
Tsubaki!

287
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:36,470
I'll teach you to turn your back on us!

288
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:43,174
Tsubaki!

289
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:50,958
Are you alright?.

290
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:53,421
It hurts!

291
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:59,657
I think you need a little more training
if you fall for something like that.

292
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:03,032
We'll see you again soon, Sir Lord!

293
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:28,554
This area's been pretty badly damaged too.

294
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:32,667
If only we'd found them earlier,
this never would have happened.

295
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:35,996
By the way, where did Tsubaki go?.

296
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:37,303
I don't know.

297
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,601
I'm worried about her.

298
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:57,389
Hey! I finally found you.

299
00:21:58,227 --> 00:21:59,091
Boss...

300
00:21:59,562 --> 00:22:02,827
It's only been a day. You shouldn't
work so hard just yet.

301
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:04,995
I'm sorry, Boss...

302
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:12,437
Boss... I'm not fit to lead your army.

303
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:14,033
Tsubaki...

304
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,170
It's really too much for me to handle.

305
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:21,816
I'm sorry but... I...I...

306
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:26,478
B...Boss...

307
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:28,887
It's alright. Let me see it.

308
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,892
It's pretty bad. The bleeding won't stop.

309
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:37,694
You shouldn't blame yourself
for this, Tsubaki.

310
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:42,870
You always call me Boss.

311
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:46,605
But when we're not working,
we're both just normal people.

312
00:22:47,143 --> 00:22:51,603
I might even be able to cheer you up a little.

313
00:22:52,982 --> 00:22:56,281
Listen, Tsubaki. I want you
to promise me one thing.

314
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:59,087
Don't be so hard on yourself.

315
00:22:59,355 --> 00:23:02,552
I get sad when I see you look like that.

316
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:03,723
Boss...

317
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:14,297
Well, let's get back and ask
Chiffon for some medicines.

318
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:29,280
Tsubaki...

319
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:33,582
I'm sorry. I know how bad it is...

320
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:37,452
...to fall in love with the Lord you serve.

321
00:23:38,227 --> 00:23:40,491
But...when I'm alone...

322
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:43,525
I can't stop thinking about you!

323
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:46,699
I can't stand being apart from you.

324
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:50,700
I can't take this anymore. I can't lie to myself.

325
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:53,803
Tsubaki...

326
00:23:54,877 --> 00:23:56,970
I'm so sorry you've suffered.

327
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,581
You're so beautiful, Tsubaki.

328
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:38,051
You're shaking. Are you scared?.

329
00:24:38,354 --> 00:24:40,288
I'm not shaking.

330
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:48,722
You're so cute, Tsubaki. Just relax.

331
00:24:52,935 --> 00:24:54,994
Does that feel good?.

332
00:24:56,105 --> 00:24:57,299
I'll make you feel even better.

333
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,809
No...There?.!

334
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:12,914
It smells so good. And it's very soft.

335
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:14,919
No... Not down there.

336
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:22,592
Do you usually wear underwear
under your kimono?.

337
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:25,962
I know girls wear cute underwear.

338
00:25:26,602 --> 00:25:31,539
I don't need that stuff in battle.

339
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:36,577
You'll catch a cold if you don't
wear anything down here.

340
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:41,275
Don't say such nasty things...

341
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:49,080
Huh?. Tsubaki... Her body reacts when I talk dirty.

342
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:51,986
Well...Let me try this.

343
00:25:56,932 --> 00:26:00,527
You're great, Tsubaki. Look how
wet you're getting.

344
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:03,564
No... Please...Don't say that.

345
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:06,800
If you keep saying that... I'll...

346
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:10,011
You'll drive me crazy!

347
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,092
Did you come already?.

348
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,495
Y.. Yes.

349
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:33,398
Boss...

350
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:45,272
How does that feel, Boss?.

351
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:47,942
Tsubaki...That's great!

352
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:12,002
Don't, Tsubaki! That will make me...

353
00:27:14,143 --> 00:27:17,135
Boss, I want to return the
pleasure you gave me.

354
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:41,734
Tsubaki. I can't hold it...

355
00:28:03,358 --> 00:28:05,258
I'm sorry, Tsubaki.

356
00:28:05,794 --> 00:28:08,991
I don't mind. I love every part of you.

357
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:13,262
I love you, Tsubaki.

358
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:17,171
Are you sure?.

359
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,207
I want to...With you...

360
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,474
I'll put it in...

361
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:26,636
Boss...

362
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:38,251
Oh, my god! It's in me!
You're inside me!

363
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:41,995
You're amazing!

364
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:46,227
No! don't say that. I get embarrassed.

365
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:51,299
Tsubaki, I can't stand it! I'm gonna come!

366
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:59,913
Boss, you're so deep inside me!

367
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:04,011
How is it for you?.

368
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:05,880
Fucking awesome!

369
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:08,589
Me too, Boss. Me too!

370
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:17,698
Tsubaki...

371
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:22,297
Boss... I feel so hot! Hot!

372
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:26,639
No... I'm going to come!

373
00:29:31,513 --> 00:29:34,539
I... I...I can't hold it anymore!

374
00:29:36,618 --> 00:29:38,882
I'm gonna come too! Just a little more...

375
00:29:40,856 --> 00:29:42,824
Oh, God! Oh, yes!

376
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:46,091
Oh, Boss! Boss, I love you!

377
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:47,685
Tsubaki!

378
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:25,360
Are you sure this is the place?.

379
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:26,224
Yep!

380
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:27,764
Good.

381
00:30:28,837 --> 00:30:34,935
The idiots here have no idea about
the treasure buried right under their noses.
