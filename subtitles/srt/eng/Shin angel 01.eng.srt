1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,553
Koizumi...

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,516
Minako!

3
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,975
Lena!

4
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,852
Arisa!

5
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,521
Honami!

6
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,856
Damn! They're not who I want.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,610
Shizuka!

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,989
Kousuke!

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,117
Oh, I can't be patient anymore.

10
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,054
Ah! Kousuke!

11
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,647
Shizuka!

12
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,279
Shizuka!

13
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,030
Kousuke!

14
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,268
Kousuke!

15
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,202
Kousuke!

16
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,661
Shizuka!

17
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,253
Shizuka!

18
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,593
It was just a dream?

19
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,646
Man, that was really realistic.

20
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,238
Hi, my name is Kousuke Atami.

21
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,324
When you're a young man with a healthy body,

22
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,284
mornings can be a real pain.

23
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,455
But if you can't make it go away,
you might as well accept it.

24
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,376
I don't understand myself...

25
00:02:55,676 --> 00:03:00,472
New Angel 1

26
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,491
Morning!

27
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,829
Kousuke!

28
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,583
Morning!

29
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,465
Oh, no! I'm still dreaming.

30
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,342
Good morning!

31
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,137
Shizuka!

32
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,014
Good morning!

33
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,728
Hey, Atami! Get out of my way!
I almost caught Shizuka!

34
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,981
Shinoyama?

35
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,781
You may suck at sports and academics,

36
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,243
but you're an absolute genius when it
comes to the science of perversion.

37
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,912
Well, excuse me!

38
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,706
I was thinking about giving you a discount on this batch

39
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,374
once I'd developed them,

40
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,460
but now I've changed my mind.

41
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:15,339
No! I was admiring you!
Shinoyama, I love you!

42
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,217
One two! One two!

43
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,637
Oretin! Why can't you take more elegant pictures?

44
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,098
What fun would that be?

45
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,609
Here comes Shizuka!

46
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:24,491
Hey, look at that! A woman with a bat
in her pussy, coming down the street!

47
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,951
What? Where is she?

48
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,832
Her underwear clinging to her gorgeous ass is so sexy!

49
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:35,711
There was no woman
like that, you liar!

50
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,513
Why are you following me?

51
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,516
You'd better stay away from Shizuka.
Got that, Shinoyama?

52
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,684
What for?

53
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,686
Well, because...

54
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:56,481
You have no right to interfere with my artistic endeavors!

55
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,150
How can you call this art?

56
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,111
You got a problem with my work, Atami?

57
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:05,824
You can take pictures of any other
woman you want, but not Shizuka.

58
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,951
What gives you the right to tell me that?

59
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,453
It's not a right!

60
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,954
I'm just begging!

61
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,915
It's none of your business!

62
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:20,756
What? Since when do we have
such a beautiful girl in our school?

63
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,061
I think she was looking at me!

64
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,855
Yoo hoo!

65
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:46,365
Do you know who she is?

66
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,659
I'll check it out later.
It's on my schedule.

67
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,681
Oh, it's much too hot and humid.

68
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,603
What's with this weather?
I'm getting sick.

69
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,074
Kousuke, what's the matter?

70
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,877
Shizuka, do you know her?

71
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,086
No.

72
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,462
I knew it!

73
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,423
What about her?

74
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,258
You both look so depressed.

75
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,761
She walked by Atami in the hall yesterday,

76
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,432
but we checked her out and learned
that she's not a student here.

77
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,560
That's odd. Maybe she's a new transfer student.

78
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,312
That's what I thought, so I asked at the office.

79
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,564
They said there'd been no new
transfer students for two months!

80
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,274
What? Who is she then?

81
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,401
We were thinking that she might be...

82
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,947
...a ghost!

83
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,200
She is the woman with the disappearing face.

84
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,882
I know that woman.

85
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,842
She is the woman with the disappearing face.

86
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,931
Say what?

87
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,227
A woman with a disappearing face!

88
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,650
Oh, my God, a disappearing face!

89
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,653
He could be a ghost too.

90
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,657
He's not a ghost.
I think I've seen him before.

91
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,824
Shizuka!

92
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,327
I can't remember who he is.

93
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,996
A woman with a disappearing face?

94
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,082
Sounds like a real ghost story.

95
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,460
I've heard the story before.

96
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,381
Fifteen years ago, there was this guy at this school

97
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,049
who promised a girl he'd marry her.

98
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:13,345
Then he had sex with her, over and over again.

99
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,668
She got pregnant, and he made her get an abortion.

100
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,422
Then he got tired of her and found a new girlfriend.

101
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,052
When she learned the truth, it
left her in state of total shock.

102
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,763
So she left him a letter that said,
"I died because of you,"

103
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,016
and jumped in front of a train!

104
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:14,114
I've heard her head was cut clean off!

105
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,908
That guy said this girl in the picture

106
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,118
is the "woman with the disappearing face."

107
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,913
That means she could be the ghost
of the girl who killed herself!

108
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,124
Shizuka!

109
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,584
What's the matter?

110
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,636
You're looking at the wrong side of the picture, Shizuka.

111
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,892
Don't scare me like that, Shizuka.

112
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:45,604
Sorry, but the girl in this picture is my sterious.

113
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,798
Give it back!

114
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,262
Give my head back to me!

115
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,862
Good grief! What a nightmare!

116
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,825
Hello!

117
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:43,453
Hi, Shinoyama. What's your problem, calling me this late.

118
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,335
Atami, you're going to die.

119
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,839
Don't mess with me like that.

120
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,927
Remember the picture I took of
you after taking that girl's picture?

121
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,556
I checked that picture again, very carefully,

122
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,977
and there's a woman's head behind you!

123
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,938
Oh, my God! Are you serious?

124
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,400
I'll show you the picture tomorrow.

125
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,736
I'm sure she's a ghost.

126
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,572
Maybe the girl who killed herself at the train crossing

127
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:21,325
came back to find the man who abandoned her!

128
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,120
Maybe you look like him and she's hunting you down!

129
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,751
Hey, Atami!
Are you listening to me?

130
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:35,005
Shinoyama, can you keep this a secret?

131
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,342
Sure thing.

132
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:49,061
Can you go shopping with me today?

133
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,187
Yeah, sure.

134
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,731
Hi! Good morning.

135
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,153
And then...

136
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,698
Why are you running away from me?

137
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,536
Wait up!

138
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,540
All right, you.

139
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,291
What's the matter?

140
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,252
I don't want to die.

141
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,421
Don't come near me, you possessed man!

142
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,882
Shinoyama!

143
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,720
Shinoyama, you rotten skunk!
You betrayed me!

144
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,824
Kousuke...

145
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,295
I'm back after twelve years.

146
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,132
Minako! More, more!

147
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,427
Stop that, Atami, you pervert!

148
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,512
Atami?

149
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,313
I don't believe it.
You aren't my Kousuke, are you?

150
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,246
You can't kill yourself just because your canary died,

151
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,123
even if you loved it very much.

152
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,960
Kousuke, you have never had such a sad experience before.

153
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,505
You can't understand how I feel.

154
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,551
Oh, your haircut's so cool!

155
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,596
You must be a bad boy at your kindergarten!

156
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,805
No, you're wrong.

157
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,725
A bully from the elementary school cut my hair this way.

158
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:54,186
I was so depressed I wanted to die,

159
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,647
but if I do, I'm the one who'll lose.

160
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,652
Even if you're hurting and depressed,

161
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,654
if you let yourself die, you lose.

162
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,199
Be strong, Shizuka.

163
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,789
I left town twelve years ago
When my father got transferred.

164
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,667
When I came back twelve years later,

165
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,295
I couldn't find my strong, brave Kousuke.

166
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,345
Shizuka!

167
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:30,305
Cheer up, Kousuke!

168
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:37,479
I'll stick with you, so don't be afraid.

169
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:43,110
I've heard about you being haunted by a ghost

170
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,570
and how nobody wants to come near you.

171
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,405
But I'm not like them.

172
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,158
But I might be haunted just
like the rumor says.

173
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:54,204
I don't care. I'll be with you.

174
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:57,875
No! I won't let them kidnap you to their world!

175
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,503
I won't let you go by yourself!

176
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:02,754
I'm going by myself!

177
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,257
No! I'll go with you!

178
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,133
By myself!

179
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,176
With me!

180
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,218
Alone!

181
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,219
Not without me!

182
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:09,928
By myself!

183
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,888
Me too!

184
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:11,597
By myself!

185
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,056
I will!

186
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,060
What is that?

187
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,855
Sounds like a woman moaning.

188
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:30,282
A woman's voice!
Kousuke, I'm scared!

189
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,825
Shizuka...

190
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:47,174
Chemical Storage And Preparation

191
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:27,756
Why not exchange information with your ghost?
I can help, no matter what the problem.

192
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,216
There it is! We found it!

193
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,722
Shizuka, I don't want to visit this medium.

194
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,224
What are you talking about?

195
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:41,854
We can't solve this ghost problem
without the help of a psychic.

196
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,648
Do you really believe that?

197
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,027
Whether I believe it or not isn't the point!

198
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:53,699
If we're going to solve your problem,
we've got to do whatever's necessary.

199
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,286
You think that much of me?

200
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,957
I asked around and finally heard about this psychic.

201
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,293
Let's give her a try.
She's got a good reputation.

202
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:15,554
I understand your story.
Now, you, gentleman, come here.

203
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:17,806
Excuse me...

204
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:22,728
I need to talk to a person alone, so I can concentrate.

205
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,606
I see. Well, Kousuke?

206
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:31,445
It's okay. I don't want any ghosts possessing you, Shizuka.

207
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,156
I understand.
I'll wait for you outside.

208
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,125
BIG GOD

209
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,548
Please wait one second.

210
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:00,724
What? That old woman wasn't the psychic?

211
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,686
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

212
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,669
Do the same.

213
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,963
What? I need to take off my clothes too?

214
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,802
My approach to sympathize with your
ghost begins with physical contact.

215
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:44,142
To sympathize means to exchange feelings.

216
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:49,189
Physical contact is a means to sharing.

217
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,649
You understand, correct?

218
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,443
I guess.

219
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:56,488
I'm not good at logic.

220
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,032
This too is a way.

221
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:01,577
I wonder if I'm doing the right thing?

222
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,199
Shizuka, I'm sorry.

223
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,040
Kousuke...

224
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,003
Bye, see you tomorrow.

225
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,090
So, is she your girlfriend?

226
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,432
What? You mean Ruri?

227
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:11,230
I guess it's not unusual to have a
girlfriend when you're in high school.

228
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,608
No, she's not that kind of friend.

229
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,735
We have a very platonic relationship,
like hand in hand.

230
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,073
By the way, Shizuka,

231
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,700
would you like to have some tea with me on the way home?

232
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,415
What are you looking at?!

233
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,461
You're a pervert and a wimp!

234
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,922
You weren't like this twelve years ago.

235
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:41,885
I think you were better back then too.

236
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:22,092
Yes! Good! Like that!

237
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,476
Kousuke!

238
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:40,319
More!

239
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,155
Oh, no!

240
00:22:49,578 --> 00:23:00,047
Ghost who wants to kill this man,
Kousuke Atami, come into my body.

241
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,029
Oh, so good! More, more!

242
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,907
Please sympathize with me.

243
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:28,367
Yes, Ma'am!

244
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,887
Kousuke!

245
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:06,780
Oh, it's coming, coming to me.

246
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,994
Not that coming!
I feel like I'm coming soon!

247
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,627
Hold on, Kousuke!

248
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,922
Once you've done your penance,
I know you'll be saved from this haunting!

249
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,137
Oh, I'm coming!

250
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,640
Wait a minute!
I came a long way to see you

251
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:36,101
and I don't want you to leave without hearing my story.

252
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:41,064
Can you hear me woman with the disappearing face?

253
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,900
If you hear me, please respond.

254
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,071
My name is Kousuke Atami.

255
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,324
I am not the man who dumped you!

256
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,576
You've made a mistake, do you understand?

257
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:55,537
If you know I'm not the one, please
find your way back to Heaven!

258
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:02,669
I'm coming!

259
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,049
You can come but I won't.

260
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,093
However, I can't hold it anymore.

261
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,199
Excuse me?

262
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,409
Give this envelope to the old woman.

263
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:37,204
I like you so I won't charge you.

264
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,705
What? But...

265
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:41,542
Come to see me again. Take care.

266
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,001
Thank you very much.

267
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:54,346
Well, that was a surprise. Is this
a secret sex club or something?

268
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:58,684
Hey! How was it?
Did the ghost leave?

269
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,143
Are you relieved now?

270
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:11,196
I don't know whether
I'm relieved or not.

271
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:16,743
If I don't do something,
I could be killed

272
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,495
by this ghost because of a stupid mistake!

273
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:24,501
Hey, Kousuke, wait up!

274
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:28,422
Shizuka, would you please leave me alone?

275
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,801
Why? I'm worried about you, Kousuke!

276
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,928
This is my problem, not yours.

277
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,972
Stop sticking your nose into my business!

278
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:39,641
What the...

279
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:43,437
Please, just leave me alone.

280
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:46,481
That's stupid!

281
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:49,401
Kousuke, you jerk!

282
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:55,199
Shizuka, I'm sorry.

283
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,744
I don't want you getting involved with this ghost thing.

284
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,204
Try to understand.

285
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:05,209
Now, I have to fight!
I'll find her!

286
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:11,507
This is that man we saw the other day,

287
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,301
the one who knew the "woman with the disappearing face."

288
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:17,971
If I can find him, I'll get some
useful information about her.

289
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:26,688
Have you ever seen this guy?

290
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:31,485
Excuse me but have you seen this
man? Do you know what class he's in?

291
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,987
Excuse me. Do you know this man with a weird face?

292
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:39,993
All of the students at this school
already know I'm being haunted.

293
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:43,664
School Office

294
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:48,043
Kousuke is such a stubborn jerk.

295
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:51,922
Well if he's going to be like that,
I'll just find my own way to save him!

296
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:57,553
You've got to give us a present if you want to join this gang.

297
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,973
If you've got no money,
I'll take your watch.

298
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,976
Oh, will you please forgive me, "sister?"

299
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,271
You little bitch!

300
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:12,484
Aw, shucks! I cut in the wrong place!

301
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:18,157
Scared? Pissed your panties and want to go home?

302
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,534
Just take a dump in the dirt, say
you're sorry and give us a present!

303
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:23,996
You bitch! Stop that!

304
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:26,790
I, Kousuke Atami, won't let you get away with this!

305
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:43,348
Hey, jerk off!
You can't be a man like that.

306
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:48,520
Damn you! You hurt an innocent man!

307
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:56,445
How about that?

308
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:08,040
Kousuke, you came to help me because you care about me.

309
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,213
Stop that!

310
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:17,174
Shizuka?

311
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:22,346
You jerk!

312
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,432
Shizuka!

313
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,062
What?

314
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,485
The hairstyle is similar but this can't be him.

315
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,695
There's no information with these pictures.

316
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:50,165
This drawing's just not good enough to identify him.

317
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,713
I've heard you're looking for me.

318
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,966
Oh, you're here!

319
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,969
Good timing.
I was looking for you too.

320
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,639
About a woman with a disappearing face.

321
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,100
She wants to see you.

322
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,394
What did you say?

323
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:14,106
She said she'll be waiting for you in the
old chemistry lab after school today.

324
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,817
Can you "sympathize" with a ghost?

325
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:20,362
You poor thing!

326
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:21,864
Poor thing?

327
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,203
Oh! Hey!

328
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:32,583
He appears and disappears with too much melodrama.

329
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:38,797
And what did he mean by "poor thing?"

330
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:50,058
The old chemistry lab isn't used anymore.

331
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,394
It's located in the most remote portion of the old building.

332
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:57,858
Rumor says it was also used for
washing dead bodies, during the war.

333
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,318
Chemical Storage And Preparation

334
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,780
I'm not scared of no ghosts!

335
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,129
It can't be!

336
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:22,049
It sounds like someone's washing blood off of the floor!

337
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,217
It's just an illusion.
I must be hearing things!

338
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:24,218
It's just a ghost.

339
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:27,846
Even though the ghost is a woman,
I'm not going to forgive her!

340
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:30,390
Hurry up and show your face!

341
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,935
Who do you think you are?

342
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,717
Oh, what happened?

343
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:50,179
Oh, what am I feeling?
It feels so good!

344
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,739
Ghost pussy!

345
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,828
Oh, you're awake now!

346
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,872
Oh, a ghost is giving me a blow job.

347
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:18,373
What the hell is this?

348
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:21,084
If I was a ghost, I couldn't give you such a good blow job.

349
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,026
But...

350
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:51,114
It's all right. I'm licking up the
liquid quite nicely, pee and all.

351
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:57,120
If you're not a ghost, why was your
face behind me in that picture?

352
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:01,708
Oh, was my picture taken?

353
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,336
It must have been when I was hiding in the bushes.

354
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:08,423
Why?

355
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,092
I was following you.

356
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:13,220
When I saw you in the hallway,
I thought you were my "type."

357
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,058
That's why you were staring at me.

358
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:36,577
Now, it's my turn to pee on you!

359
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:42,958
Who are you?
I'm sure you're not a student here.

360
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,918
Are you sure you're not a ghost?

361
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:53,635
Oh, feels good.

362
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,220
Answer me!

363
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,014
Wow! What a close up!

364
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:01,351
I'm a student at the Hayasaka
Girl's School next door.

365
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:03,812
What? But you're wearing this school's uniform.

366
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:07,733
That's because my older sister
was a student of this school, and...

367
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,569
I borrowed it from her.

368
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:13,822
So, you sneaked into this school by
pretending to be a student here, right?

369
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,245
Exactly, and now it's your turn to sneak into me.

370
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:48,315
I've got more questions.

371
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:52,569
What was that weird sound we heard after school?

372
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:54,071
That was me.

373
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:58,033
It sounded like this.

374
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,911
Oh, feels good.

375
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,788
You were doing like this?

376
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:09,419
Yes, I was doing this with my ex-boyfriend.

377
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:21,181
Ah, good.

378
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:25,894
Oh, ouch! Well then, who's your ex-boyfriend?

379
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:29,857
He gave you my message, didn't he?

380
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:34,027
You poor thing.

381
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:39,032
He called me "poor thing."
What was that about?

382
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:42,161
Oh, no! Did he say such a thing?

383
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:47,666
Tell me, what are your real intentions?

384
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,751
I just want to fuck you.

385
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:52,921
He's gotten really, really thin
because we had sex too much.

386
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:54,756
He spoke to you ironically because he thought

387
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:56,383
you would have exactly the same experience he had.

388
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,343
Do you like fucking that much?

389
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:01,722
Yes, I need it everyday.

390
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:04,558
I need this again and again, everyday.

391
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:24,703
What a surprise! No wonder he became such a thin man.

392
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:28,123
It's not my fault.
I think you can hold up.

393
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:29,082
Why do you think so?

394
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:31,043
You're as perverted as
I've heard you are.

395
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,587
You can take a licking and keep on
ticking. You're tough and very hard.

396
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:35,130
You fell for me, didn't you?

397
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:37,341
However, the biggest question still remains.

398
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:38,800
What do you mean?

399
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,681
Who's the woman with the disappearing face?

400
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:49,269
A disappearing face?

401
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:54,650
Yes, if you are not a ghost, your
face can't disappear, can it?

402
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,156
I see. He said that, did he?

403
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:02,950
No more excuses.

404
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:06,537
Having sex with a ghost is the most
unsettling experience of my entire life.

405
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:10,791
A mid-summer night's day dream or wet dream.

406
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,293
Maybe if I have sex with you
and think of a song in my dream,

407
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:14,753
you can find your way to Heaven.

408
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:17,047
How about Cock-me-all-night?

409
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,882
You mean Cavilian Night?

410
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,384
Keep your eyes on me.

411
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,469
The rhythm burns me up!

412
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,223
Keep looking.

413
00:38:55,836 --> 00:39:00,507
So fast... I've never seen a blow job this fast!

414
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,260
"The woman with the disappearing face" might mean...

415
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:06,680
She disappeared!

416
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:17,024
Oh! I'm gonna die!

417
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:27,284
I'm Kousuke. Is Shizuka at home?

418
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:32,122
Hikawa Shrine? She went there?

419
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:39,546
I have to apologize to Shizuka.

420
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,147
Ninety-eight...

421
00:39:58,148 --> 00:40:00,108
Once I've prayed 100 times, my wish
will come true, or so I've heard.

422
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,568
Just two more times.

423
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,325
The ghost of the woman possessing
Kousuke will go somewhere else.

424
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:11,620
Kousuke is perverted and it's his nature.

425
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:14,414
But I can't hate him.

426
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:16,708
Hey, hey, Minako. Let's fuck.

427
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,211
No way! You're too obnoxious to have sex with.

428
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:23,298
What do you want?

429
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:27,719
Pervert! Idiot! Shame on you.

430
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,055
Shame? What?

431
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:32,808
What? You don't understand?

432
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:38,272
Sorry, Shizuka, I understand.

433
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:47,990
Do you want some more violent advice?!

434
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:51,243
I'm just kidding.

435
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:52,703
You jerk!

436
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:57,708
Shizuka, If you go out with me,
I won't talk to other women.

437
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:58,667
I won't have sex with other women.

438
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:01,712
I promise, Shizuka! Don't go!

439
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:05,799
No matter what he says, I already
know he's just a normal pervert.

440
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:09,678
It's his energy.
I can't handle his energy.

441
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,847
Because I am a single woman waiting for marriage.

442
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:23,025
Shizuka...

443
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:24,526
Ninety-nine!

444
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:32,201
I wanted to be more feminine and
stop ped being a gang member

445
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:33,952
because I found my Kousuke again.

446
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:36,747
He wasn't quite the man I expected,

447
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:39,791
but he's attractive enough for me

448
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,335
especially since other women were chasing him.

449
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:44,463
I'm a woman who's fallen in love with Kousuke.

450
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:50,260
Oh, God. Please protect Kousuke from
that ghost, even if he is a pervert.

451
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:54,014
I will make your dream come true.

452
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:56,475
Kousuke!

453
00:41:57,643 --> 00:42:01,438
Shizuka, please be with me.
I won't leave you anymore.

454
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:03,315
Wait!

455
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:05,818
One more time left to complete my prayers.

456
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:09,571
Shizuka!

457
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:14,660
Thank you, God.
I think Kousuke's okay, for now.

458
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:18,497
Kousuke's the only man for me.

459
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:22,251
Please keep watching over and protecting him.

460
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:29,967
The haunting problem has been solved!

461
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:31,927
But there's someone I can't forgive!

462
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:34,137
You're an asshole, Shinoyama!

463
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:39,518
Making up and spreading stories about
suicides jumping in front of trains!

464
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,335
Taking off my school uniform

465
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:09,506
Taking out the ribbon from my hair

466
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:14,970
Whispering "beautiful" without planning

467
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:18,140
A different girl

468
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:22,477
I will change to be

469
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:27,483
I will learn for you

470
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:35,199
Bravery to believe, it's the power

471
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,369
Bravery to love

472
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:48,587
I can hear your voice even though we are far apart

473
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:53,008
I know the danger instantly

474
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:57,721
Keeping your promise to me

475
00:43:57,763 --> 00:44:01,099
I love you forever

476
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:06,146
Yes, close your eyes in your dream

477
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:23,455
You touched my hair

478
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:27,334
You reached deep inside of my heart

479
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:31,713
Now I am waiting

480
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:36,260
Being close to you

481
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:40,138
Including your whole heart

482
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,977
I am falling in love with you
