1
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,200
It's very late, my father
must be waiting for me.

2
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,500
Heinrich, let's hurry!

3
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,260
Yes sir!

4
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,740
Dunan is still missing?

5
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,610
Yes.

6
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,190
They say Sho, the son
of the late King Bassen...

7
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,820
overthrew King Randis.

8
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,600
Furthermore, he entrusted the throne
to Teo the Nomad, and departed!

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,190
What is all this!?

10
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,160
King Randis's family was spared,
yet Princess Diana is missing.

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,470
Is my son Dunan with Diana!?

12
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,640
Well, we could not...

13
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,770
You are all good for nothing!
What have you been investigating!?

14
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,360
Dunan...

15
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,390
You are not good enough of
a soldier to be the Prince of Gupta.

16
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,420
A kingdom that's
celebrated for its valor.

17
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,690
However, if you rule Doria
with your superior intellect...

18
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,470
it will bring infinite
prosperity to our kingdom.

19
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,120
That was the
reason I sent you to Doria.

20
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,640
I was planning to marry
you to Diana. Yet...

21
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,350
Father, I apologize
for being so late.

22
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,060
Marlon!!
You've finally returned!

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,620
I'm sorry. However,
I have completed the negotiations...

24
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,660
with the merchants of Saas.

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,700
Good work.

26
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,300
We cannot manipulate
Doria by force any longer.

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,540
We must dominate
through economic power.

28
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,940
Yes, father.
You are quite right.

29
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,480
The only problem remaining
is Dunan's whereabouts!

30
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,480
Be assured, I will find him.

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,640
FENCER OF MINERVA
Chapter 4: The Storm

32
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,500
This is the city of Saas.

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,150
Now, this is a real trade center.

34
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,450
Splendid!
Without trade with this city...

35
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,890
Doria wouldn't have
prospered as it did.

36
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,460
Master, let's get down there.

37
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,850
Alright
Don't be so hasty.

38
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,660
But...

39
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,090
OK, let's go.

40
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,070
Right now, Teo must be living
the boring life of a King

41
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,620
You wouldn't
recognize this as Doria!

42
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,720
Really?

43
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,050
I am happy to see
that business is flourishing.

44
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,000
He is definitely King Teo.

45
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,070
Hanna, if by any chance I fail,
report to Prince Marlon.

46
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,510
Yes, brother.

47
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,990
I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat.

48
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,720
Yes!

49
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,720
Guards from the castle!

50
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,920
Well, well... good work.

51
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,000
Master, you are the King of Doria.
It cannot be helped.

52
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,440
Imil must have sent them.

53
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,770
Yes I did, Sire.

54
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,310
Imil!

55
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,540
Since you became King,
Doria has recovered its power...

56
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,750
and fortune of some ten years ago.

57
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,320
Well, if Sho had stayed, this
kingdom may have prospered even more.

58
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,490
Your Highness!
That is not my point.

59
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:04,600
We are surrounded by nations
scheming to rob us of our property.

60
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,630
Especially, Gupta from the North!

61
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,640
Imil, not again.
I've heard enough of that.

62
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,470
No, Your Highness!

63
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,710
It is too dangerous to come
into the city without guards!

64
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,720
Assassins hired
by neighboring nations...

65
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,050
could attack you at any time.

66
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,650
OK... OK. Being King
is a boring occupation.

67
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,950
Please understand,
I need to have a good time...

68
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,890
out of the castle
once in a while.

69
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,000
Now, leave us alone.

70
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,360
Yes, Sire.
Please be careful.

71
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,970
A clever man,
but he is too overprotective.

72
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,680
He's very concerned for your safety.

73
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,910
I hear Mr. Imil completed his studies
at the academy with top honors.

74
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,520
He is indispensable
as a royal adviser.

75
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,180
Oh, you speak so highly of him.

76
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,360
That's what you always say, Master.

77
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,990
Right, Fina?

78
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,590
Yes.

79
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,170
I guess it is.

80
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,710
Oh, yes, Fina.

81
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,080
Please attend to Imil,
starting tomorrow.

82
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,450
That's a very good idea.

83
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,710
Ulsra, I was also thinking
about making you my Queen.

84
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,320
What do you think?

85
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,520
I am happy as I'll ever be!

86
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,290
You don't want to be freed?

87
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,220
I'd much rather be riding
in the field with you, Master.

88
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,870
You are precious.
I'd rather be riding, too.

89
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,540
Hey old man!
Three kebabs, and... well, Valna wine.

90
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,070
Yes, sir.

91
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,210
Here we go.

92
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,860
Master!

93
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,300
Somebody! Help!

94
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,370
Your Highness!!

95
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,470
Master!

96
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,670
Your Highness!

97
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,570
Your Highness!!
Don't move!

98
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,370
This is lizard poison!!

99
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,680
Lizard poison!?

100
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,590
No, Master!!
Don't leave me!!

101
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,720
Wow, I wonder
what kind of fruit this is?

102
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,420
Look at that!!

103
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,460
Such a beautiful necklace!
I wish I had one like that.

104
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,620
Diana, stay close to me.

105
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,630
You are the most
valuable merchandise here.

106
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,240
If we become separated,
a barbarian merchant can steal you.

107
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,680
If you're put on a ship,
even I won't be able to rescue you.

108
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,610
No! I don't want that!

109
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,710
Even a prosperous and lively
city has its share of villains.

110
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,420
I... I see.

111
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,690
Well, let's eat.

112
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,090
Yes.

113
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,800
Is it checkmate?

114
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,830
No one could beat Seneca.

115
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,870
Well, I haven't played him yet.
You never know.

116
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,540
Forget it, you won't have a chance.

117
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,620
How about it?
Are you ready to give up?

118
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,650
No! Not yet!

119
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,960
He's right.
He can still win.

120
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,960
Don't you think?

121
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,720
No, you'll lose if
you make that move!!

122
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,200
You!
What did you just say!?

123
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,440
I apologize for my
slave's bad manners!

124
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,380
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,540
I am very sorry!

126
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,810
It's not my position
to make such remarks!

127
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,220
Please, please forgive me!

128
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,410
No, I won't!

129
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,590
You! A lowly slave,
interrupted our game!

130
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,590
It's not something your
master can apologize for!

131
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,060
Then, what can we do
to receive your forgiveness?

132
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,830
Will you be satisfied if
I punish my slave right here?

133
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,240
No... I've made a name for
myself as the Merchant Seneca.

134
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,640
I do not wish to
create a scene in public.

135
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,280
You...

136
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,110
You seem to be extremely
confident about this game.

137
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,710
Do you think you
can win from this stage?

138
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,190
No, please disregard
my earlier remark!

139
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,690
No, you already said it.
That's right, isn't it?!

140
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:26,890
Right!

141
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,790
We heard it!

142
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,800
She said it!

143
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,800
So now, you will
take over this game.

144
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,760
Is it alright?

145
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,960
Ah, yeah, OK.
That's fine with me.

146
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,310
Naturally, I'll let you
take your bet back.

147
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,230
And in it's place...

148
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,340
you will put yourself at stake!

149
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:53,320
If you win... if you really can win...
you can have my slave.

150
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,120
However! If you lose,
you will become mine!!

151
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,150
That's exciting!

152
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,050
Do it! Do it!

153
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:12,970
Understood.

154
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,970
If that's what's required for forgiveness,
Diana will play the game.

155
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,040
Alright, Diana?

156
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,450
Y... yes. If you allow me, Master.

157
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,950
Good!!
Take a seat.

158
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,560
I am honored to be
playing this game with you, sir.

159
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,950
Let's begin.

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,300
Picking up from the last move.

161
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,030
Yes.

162
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,440
Oh... I didn't think of that!

163
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,710
Your turn, Sir.

164
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,410
I know, I know!

165
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,290
H... hey, this move is...

166
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,630
from that legendary game!

167
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,860
She knows about that game?

168
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,000
A slave?

169
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,480
There's no mistake about it.

170
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,810
Those are the moves of Lyan,
the Dorian master, when he...

171
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,840
was playing against King Bassen.

172
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,740
Shut up! Damn!

173
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,920
How about this!?

174
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,250
Sir, are you absolutely certain?

175
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,280
Yes, I am.

176
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,890
Then, three more
moves to check mate.

177
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,100
Wh... what!?
It can't be!

178
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,530
I give up.

179
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,710
Hell of a game.

180
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,540
Thank you for a great game.

181
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,440
You're a great player.

182
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,740
I'm overwhelmed.
Tell me, Diana...

183
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,450
where did you learn
to play like that?

184
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,660
I was taught by
Lyan of Doria, for many years.

185
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,920
I see. So that explains it.
You're no ordinary player.

186
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,290
And, you are...

187
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,300
Sho, from Dori... from Pieta.

188
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Sho, you have a great slave.
Take good care of her.

189
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,700
Thanks for your compliments.

190
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,540
Oh, that's our Seneca,
a true gamester!

191
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,740
A deal is a deal.
Take her.

192
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,290
My name is Shiera.

193
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,220
You will not be my slave.

194
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,950
Diana won the game.

195
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,660
Alright!
I'll take her.

196
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,970
A slave takes a slave!!

197
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,600
I never heard of such a thing.

198
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,870
Hey, young man.
You won't be able to sleep tonight.

199
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,400
Nice wench!

200
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,750
Shiera?

201
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,720
Yes, Master.

202
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,190
That's too confusing.
Call me Diana.

203
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,520
Yes, Miss Diana.

204
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,150
You and Mr. Seneca are?

205
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,490
He purchased me a few days ago.

206
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,230
That's not what I meant.
Well, how shall I put it...

207
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,040
Did he cherish you?

208
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,340
Yes, he was a very nice Master.

209
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,740
Only...

210
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:43,070
It was all my fault.
I wasn't good enough to please him.

211
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
That's why he didn't...

212
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,550
Don't think like that.
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

213
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,350
No, please, Master!
I mean, Miss Diana.

214
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,890
I am your slave now.

215
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,790
I will have you, then.

216
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,700
Diana, you!

217
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,470
Please watch us, Master.

218
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,640
B... but...

219
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,050
A slave is not allowed to keep
secrets from her Master.

220
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,820
Take your clothes off.

221
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,720
Such a beautiful body.
Come, Shiera... please me.

222
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,800
Y... yes... Miss Diana.
Please enjoy me.

223
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,600
Pretty Shiera...

224
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,110
Master!

225
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,440
So good... Miss Diana!

226
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,940
Shiera, you want Mr. Sho
to use you, don't you?

227
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,150
Miss Diana... This is so nice!

228
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,380
You can tell me.

229
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,630
No...

230
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,390
Do you want me to ask him?

231
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,130
Yes...

232
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,830
Master, please take her.

233
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,930
Now hold on!

234
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,800
When he lost the game,
Mr. Seneca told you that...

235
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,340
his slave was yours.

236
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,880
Yes, he did... but... I can't take her.

237
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,650
That's all right, Miss Diana.

238
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:10,200
I... I am... so immature and
unattractive; everyone refuses me.

239
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,570
Wait a minute, Shiera.
That's not what I meant.

240
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,330
But it's true.

241
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,900
Mr. Seneca abandoned me
because I was too ugly.

242
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,540
No, you are exceptionally pretty.

243
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,440
Then... you would use me!

244
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,150
Alright.

245
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,930
It's so... so...

246
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,270
Ah, it's wonderful, Mr. Sho!

247
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,910
Master...

248
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,780
I've been thinking since
that time with Patris...

249
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,630
What is it?

250
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,220
Please take both of us at once!

251
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,490
You've changed so much.

252
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,590
Mr. Sho... Miss Diana!

253
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,040
What?
You want to buy back Shiera?

254
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,650
I am the Merchant Seneca,
one of the biggest merchants in Saas.

255
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,020
I won't be stingy.

256
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,610
I would like to buy
Shiera for 50 gold coins.

257
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,420
50 gold coins!

258
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,680
You will, Master?

259
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,350
Seneca, you seem to
be very attached to this woman.

260
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,260
Ah, well...

261
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,930
Shiera, do you want
to return to Seneca?

262
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,670
Y... yes.
If you would allow me?

263
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,900
Seneca, take her back.

264
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,210
Oh, thank you!

265
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,640
No. There is no
need for you to pay.

266
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,470
It's alright with you, Diana?

267
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,510
Yes, I was hoping this would happen.

268
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,280
I'm happy for you, Shiera.

269
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,310
Your Master
cares about you, after all.

270
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,420
Y... yes.

271
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,450
Go!

272
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,950
Master...

273
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,760
I'm sorry for what I did.

274
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,600
Even though I was
so occupied by the game...

275
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,230
I shouldn't have bet you.
Forgive me.

276
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,570
No, Master, I'm the one
who must be punished.

277
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,550
Last night,
those two used me.

278
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,480
I was drunk with pleasure
for the first time in my life.

279
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,980
What? You?

280
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,210
To the extent that I begged
for more and more.

281
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,820
But you were so inexperienced...

282
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,520
Please punish my lascivious body.

283
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,960
I see, I have to check how
lascivious you have become...

284
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,160
over the course of one night.

285
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,840
OK, Shiera?

286
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,670
Y... yes.

287
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,470
I thank both of you.

288
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,040
By the way, Diana, about the game...

289
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,380
where did you learn
from Lyan, the Dorian master?

290
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,390
When I was serving
at the court of Doria.

291
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,920
I see... at the court of Doria.

292
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,690
Speaking of Doria,
I heard a couple days ago...

293
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,200
that their new King
was assaulted.

294
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,720
Did you hear as well?

295
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,230
What!? Teo!?

296
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,800
Assaulted!?

297
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,610
What about Teo?

298
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,910
Probably dead.

299
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,820
I see. Alberto, I'll have someone
bring the reward to you.

300
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,130
I did not volunteer for a reward.

301
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,100
It was out of my Loyalty
to you, Prince Marlon.

302
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,500
I appreciate your gesture.

303
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,290
I will see to it that your Loyalty
will be well rewarded...

304
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,860
in some other way then.

305
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,740
Thank you for your gracious words.
Then... excuse me.

306
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,610
Prince Marlon.

307
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,550
What is it, Heinrich?

308
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,580
You are not going to treat
Alberto as an equal to us?

309
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,490
Even a man from the lower classes,
such as Alberto, can be of some use.

310
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,860
Don't worry about such trivial matters.

311
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,870
Forgive me for my thoughtless words.

312
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,850
I am so sorry I couldn't do anything.

313
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,060
No, if you hadn't sucked
the poison out from his wound...

314
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,390
he would have been
killed right then and there.

315
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,230
I thank you.

316
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,160
No, it wasn't enough.

317
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,200
And, what did the doctor say?

318
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,870
Don't cry. Teo is a tough man.
He will recover.

319
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,010
Right.

320
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,140
As I have repeatedly mentioned,
Prince Dunan's whereabouts...

321
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,450
are still under investigation.

322
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,920
Mr. Adviser, you have not made
even the slightest progress.

323
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,860
I can't tell you anything as I was
not the royal adviser back then.

324
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,000
Prince Dunan's visit to
the late King Randis was treated...

325
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,470
as a private affair.

326
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,400
Therefore, no official record exists.

327
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,870
A private visit?
How disrespectful!

328
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,840
You're saying a prince from another
nation dropped by to say "hello"!

329
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,470
Well, simply put,
that's exactly what happened.

330
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,380
It 's no use speaking with you!

331
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,420
Isn't there someone
who knows what happened?

332
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,620
I'm afraid not.
King Randis took his own life.

333
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,530
Princess Diana, to whom your
Prince Dunan was to marry...

334
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,800
is missing.

335
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,890
What about the King?
Doesn't King Teo know anything?

336
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:03,140
I hear he was involved in the whole
incident when Doria was occupied.

337
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,280
His Highness is ill
and has taken to bed.

338
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,940
But, he can speak, can he not?

339
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,690
The truth is, the King was attacked
while taking an incognito stroll...

340
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,780
through the city.

341
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,720
Oh, I wasn't aware of that.
And, how is he?

342
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,630
His life was barely saved.

343
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,260
Oh, that's good.
But, this is bad timing.

344
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,300
Have you not heard about the actions
of the Council of Saas Merchants?

345
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,210
Such as?

346
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,180
They're considering which nations
they should carry on commerce with...

347
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,270
for the next year.

348
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,550
What?

349
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,580
How unfortunate for your
nation that King Teo is unwell.

350
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,620
The representatives from the Council
could pay him a visit any day.

351
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,630
Who was the assassin?

352
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,930
It was
probably an assassin from Gupta.

353
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,870
As I thought.

354
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,840
Thanks to King Teo,
within three short months...

355
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,470
Doria has recovered
its past prosperity.

356
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,280
It wouldn't have been
possible without your support.

357
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,840
That is preposterous!

358
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,220
All I know is what I
learned from books.

359
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,620
The King has encouraged commerce
with the Saas Merchants.

360
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,490
And at the same time,
he ordered the nomads...

361
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,260
to trade mainly in Doria.

362
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,830
Oh, that was very bold of him.

363
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,660
Yes.

364
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,400
No matter how valuable
the merchandise is...

365
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,900
if there's no flow of buyers
and sellers, then it is worthless.

366
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,370
On the other hand,
unless people hear...

367
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,240
that there is good merchandise
and an open market...

368
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,510
they will not come.

369
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,040
Very logical.

370
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,180
Usually, it takes many years
for a city to prosper to this degree.

371
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,510
However, King Teo...
turned it around in a mere month.

372
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,290
The skeptical Saas
Merchants trust him.

373
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,160
The nomads, despite
their flamboyant nature...

374
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,190
gather in Doria to trade rare goods.

375
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,130
He is a brilliant king.

376
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,130
He certainly is.

377
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,910
There is now nothing
you can't buy in Doria.

378
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,640
Merchants rush to our
markets from every city.

379
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,870
Because of that...

380
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,040
Gupta cannot attack Doria ostensibly.

381
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,680
That's why...

382
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,250
Mr. Sho?
What are you thinking about?

383
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,750
If you have any ideas,
please tell me.

384
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,460
But if you do not trust me?

385
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,090
I trust you.

386
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,460
Teo himself appointed
you as the Royal Adviser.

387
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,730
Sooner or later, I'm going
to need your help.

388
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,830
Look at this.

389
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,800
This is!

390
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,400
This is just
between you and me!!

391
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,600
You received it from King Teo.
That means...

392
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,110
He has taken the Oath
of Heroes with me...

393
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,140
and my father before me.

394
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,110
Then, you are brothers, no,
the bond between you two...

395
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,480
is stronger than that of brothers.

396
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,490
Yes.

397
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,120
Thank you, Mr. Sho.
Now, I can tell you everything.

398
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,490
To tell you the truth,
Doria is facing great danger!

399
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,860
I beg you, Mr. Sho.

400
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,770
Please help me find
a plan to protect Doria!

401
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,570
What?

402
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,900
I will,
with all my power.

403
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,080
Thank you.

404
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,410
However, there is one more problem.

405
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,050
The Guptans are desperately
looking for Prince Dunan.

406
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,600
We can't just give any criminal
to them claiming that he...

407
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,130
was the murderer.

408
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,310
Diana!

409
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,280
That was bad.

410
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,960
Diana...

411
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,690
I will go to Gupta.
I am the one who killed Dunan.

412
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,190
Don't you ever mention that!!

413
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,400
I made you my slave
knowing what you did.

414
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:31,870
But... but, if I don't
come forward, Doria will...

415
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:38,170
Don't worry!
Nobody wants you to do such a thing.

416
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,090
If I can save Doria
by sacrificing my life, then...

417
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,890
Don't be so conceited!

418
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,020
How can you even think
that a mere slave's life could change...

419
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,460
a country's fate?

420
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,960
If Doria was so vain,
nobody would mind if your life...

421
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,360
was ended right at this moment.

422
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,560
Teo and Imil, and everybody else,
are not suffering for that kind...

423
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,970
of fragile kingdom!

424
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,340
I'm sorry!
It was impertinent of me.

425
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,670
But... it's...

426
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,840
Dee, as much as you do,
we all care about Doria.

427
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,820
The Dorians are
concerned for us, as well.

428
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,680
Y... yes... Master.

429
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,320
Listen, Diana.

430
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,390
If the situation becomes such
that you must die...

431
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,460
I will not let you die alone.

432
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,720
Master...

433
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,260
You are not alone.
Understood?

434
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:37,410
Y... yes... Thank you.
I am yours, Master.

435
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,570
I will always be by your side.

436
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,190
We will take our leave.

437
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,750
Yes, thank you.

438
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,430
I must finish this
document as soon as possible.

439
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,900
Who's there?

440
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,250
It's me.

441
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,410
Fina.
What are you doing up so late?

442
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,720
I... I thought you must be tired.

443
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,650
I don't drink.
You ought to know that.

444
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,180
But...

445
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,620
Hey!?

446
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,530
Wh... what happened?
Why are you crying?

447
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,830
King Teo has ordered
me to attend to you.

448
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,970
He did!?

449
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,670
But, I guess I'm no use to you.

450
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,910
OK. You can give me
some wine, then.

451
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,210
But, just a little.

452
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,480
Yes, sir!

453
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,860
I never realized that
alcohol tasted this good.

454
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,390
S... stop, Fina.
I could get totally intoxicated.

455
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,470
You don't think you'll be
able to take me if you get drunk?

456
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,340
What did you say?

457
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,700
Please take me.

458
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,470
No! No!! No!!

459
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,680
Do you dislike me, Mr. Imil?

460
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,610
That's not what I mean!!
But...

461
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,390
Wh... what's gotten into you?

462
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,160
Mr. Imil... I am in love with you.

463
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,200
Do you like me?

464
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,700
Well...

465
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,200
Mr. Imil?

466
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,410
Y... yes, I do.

467
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,750
Then, will you accept my obedience?

468
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,250
Tha... that's...

469
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,150
Master... Please take me.

470
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,830
Right here?

471
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,930
Anywhere, as long as
you are with me, Master.

472
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,770
Imil!!

473
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,720
Good luck, Fina.

474
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,950
Mr. Imil will soon be the
Chief Adviser for this kingdom.

475
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,960
Ouch!

476
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,030
S... sorry...

477
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,400
A little gentler.

478
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,400
O... OK.

479
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,670
Like this?

480
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,180
Yes, that's very nice!

481
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,980
It's my first time.

482
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,610
Mine, too.

483
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,440
But, you are the King's...

484
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,050
King Teo has never used me.

485
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,530
He said he would find
a good master for me someday.

486
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:14,850
He didn't.

487
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,960
But...

488
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,200
I am well trained by Ulsra.

489
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,130
So, I think you will
be able to enjoy me!

490
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,540
I see.

491
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,010
Did I say something wrong?

492
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,080
No, you didn't.
You are very pretty, Fina.

493
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,540
Master...

494
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,340
I am so embarrassed.

495
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,450
Well, it's the first time.

496
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,230
Fina!

497
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,690
Master!

498
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,410
Merchants of Saas!?

499
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,890
What's happened?

500
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,020
How ostentatious.

501
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,860
No, that's the
Council of Saas!!

502
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,090
The Council of Saas
has made their move.

503
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,260
What will happen to Doria?

504
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,090
What!?
The Merchants of Saas!?

505
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,030
Yes!

506
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,400
At last!
Report to Mr. Sho!

507
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,510
Yes!

508
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:47,480
We are representatives
of the Council of Saas.

509
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,120
We wish to see King Teo!!

510
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,260
Do you have an appointment?

511
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,090
No!

512
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,090
Then, we must schedule one first.

513
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,490
That's all right.

514
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,600
Hello, welcome to Doria.

515
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,740
You must be tired
from the long journey.

516
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,260
The Council of Saas are
very honored guests in Doria.

517
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,000
Please do come in.

518
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,100
Excuse me, but there've been rumors
that King Teo was attacked...

519
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,140
by an unknown assailant.

520
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,180
Yes, he was.

521
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,510
Then, how is his condition?

522
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,010
I will fill you in with
more details inside.

523
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,420
Please come in.

524
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:33,100
Mr. Imil, I heard King Teo survived.
I would like to see him now.

525
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,630
That was very quick, Mr. Helman.

526
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,090
No doubt, you were informed by
a resourceful messenger from Gupta...

527
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,500
so celebrated for its valor.

528
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,770
It seems information travels fast.

529
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,800
Imil, how is King Teo?

530
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,700
I dispatched someone
to see you regarding the matter...

531
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,840
a short while ago.

532
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,870
W... what?
You did?

533
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,310
I'm so sorry.

534
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,290
It seems that the guards
weren't informed that the King...

535
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,060
wishes to see you before anyone else.

536
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,790
What!?
He does?

537
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,760
Come in, come in, please!

538
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,200
Wha... what?

539
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,830
Mr. Helman,
a messenger from Gupta!!

540
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,580
All hail His Majesty the King,
and Her Majesty the Queen!!

541
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,940
Her Majesty?
When did the King wed?

542
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,650
No idea...

543
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,350
Your Majesty,
members of the Saas Council...

544
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,370
and Mr. Helman from Gupta.

545
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:06,720
Your Majesty, your complete
recovery gives me great happiness.

546
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,930
My complete recovery?
I am in good health.

547
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,860
It seems there's
some misunderstanding.

548
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,600
Imil, you did not provide sufficient
explanation to our guests!!

549
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,540
This is an unforgivable blunder!

550
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,570
I apologize, your Majesty!!

551
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,970
The fault lies with me.

552
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,440
I dispatched the document
to their room this morning, but...

553
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,880
please forgive me!!

554
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,010
Document?
I haven't received any documents.

555
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,420
You haven't? Oh, no!

556
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,020
That is enough.

557
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,260
The messenger from Gupta is here.
It doesn't matter now.

558
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,920
The order of things is all confused.
Explain the situation to him now.

559
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,360
Mr. Helman, I apologize
for my retainer's blunder.

560
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,230
It's... no matter.

561
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,780
I am very sorry, Mr. Helman.

562
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,370
Please let me introduce
you to His Majesty, King Sho...

563
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,480
appointed by the former
King Teo, who abdicated...

564
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,990
the throne as of today
due to his illness.

565
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,160
The King?
King Sho?

566
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,920
Wha... what?

567
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,900
As you may be aware,
the father of King Sho...

568
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,200
was the late King Bassen,
who once reigned over this kingdom.

569
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,010
That is Sho!!

570
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,140
And!

571
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,540
Imil, I will introduce
the Queen to them.

572
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,080
My Queen, Diana,
is also the child of a former King...

573
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,110
King Randis.

574
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,480
Pleased to meet you all.

575
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,160
Well, Mr. Gigil,
regarding today's main subject...

576
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,160
the trading arrangement with Saas.

577
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:50,990
Tha... that is...

578
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,330
May I speak on that subject!?

579
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,720
You are!!

580
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,030
Oh, Chairman Seneca!

581
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,230
Mr. Seneca!?

582
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,970
Your Majesty, please forgive my delay.

583
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:09,380
We, the Saas Council
would like to maintain, or rather...

584
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,510
expand the close
trading relationship with Doria.

585
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,480
The free market of Doria
is a valuable trading point...

586
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,050
for the Saas Merchants.

587
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,820
Is it not?

588
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:21,660
Yes!!

589
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,220
I look forward to
expanding our relationship!

590
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,900
As do we.

591
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,170
By the way, Mr. Helman,
you said you have a question...

592
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
you wanted to ask us?

593
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,070
Y... yes. Your Majesty.

594
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:40,070
Regarding the disappearance
of Prince Dunan.

595
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,250
I understand your concern.

596
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,150
However, I wonder if this is
an appropriate place to discuss...

597
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,610
such an important matter
between our two nations?

598
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,750
As you say, Your Majesty.

599
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,180
The young must honor their elders.

600
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,490
Why don't we visit King Gauss
to introduce ourselves...

601
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,360
and explain the situation?

602
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,270
I beg your pardon!?

603
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,030
I and my Queen both
have met Prince Dunan.

604
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:11,170
If we have an opportunity
to speak with King Gauss directly...

605
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,580
we may be able to find
some clue as to where he is.

606
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,740
Mr. Helman, I wish that
you would assume the role...

607
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,450
as an intermediary
and arrange our visit.

608
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,850
As you wish.

609
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,930
Thank you.
We are counting on you.

610
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,050
Please be assured, Your Majesty.

611
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,600
Dismissed.

612
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,090
Your Majesty.

613
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,600
His Majesty the King
and Her Majesty the Queen!!

614
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,850
I am about to
suffocate in these clothes.

615
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,580
You were excellent.

616
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,790
Just as I expected from you
as a former Princess.

617
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,260
I wouldn't have
been able to pull it off...

618
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,290
"Pleased to meet you all".

619
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,070
Ulsra, that's pretty good.
You sound just like her.

620
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,830
Seneca.

621
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,970
Mr. Seneca.

622
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,370
You made a great King
and Queen back there.

623
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,980
I was surprised.

624
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,280
I had no idea you were
the Chairman of the Saas Council.

625
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,780
We didn't know you
were in such a high position.

626
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,290
You saved us.
Thank you!

627
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,760
No, no. I owe you 50 gold coins.

628
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:46,390
No, Shiera is worth more
than 50 gold coins now.

629
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:53,970
Since Shiera is back, I am...
Well, as the nomads often say...

630
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,570
"There's nothing better
than a good slave," is there?

631
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:06,080
Right, that's it!
Well, I'm going to free Shiera soon.

632
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,520
I've had many slaves since
my wife passed away...

633
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,000
but Shiera is like no other.

634
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,530
Then?

635
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,540
Yes, I am going
to take her as my wife.

636
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,830
That's wonderful!!

637
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,070
Mr. Sho, Teo is coming round!!

638
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:24,840
He is!!

639
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,340
Master...

640
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,770
Get me a doctor.

641
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,150
I said, "Get me a doctor"!

642
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,750
I need to chase this stupid poison
out of my system as soon as possible!

643
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,530
Y, yes!!

644
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,890
Imil.

645
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,060
You clever little boy, how did you
come up with such a scheme?

646
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,830
Thank you.

647
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:55,410
Sho, Gupta's reaction to all of this,
that's the main issue now.

648
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,380
Exactly, we still have
a long way to go.

649
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:30,730
In a pair of yearning eyes,
I fall into a dream...

650
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:44,310
and again the hard
wind blows in.

651
00:43:49,290 --> 00:44:01,330
Turning back the long
way I have come...

652
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:14,650
the shadows of flowers
are swaying in the wind.

653
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:36,410
In the sky, a bird cries out...

654
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:59,600
Although the pain in my
heart brings me down...

655
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:05,670
with you...

656
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:16,080
someday...

657
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:22,420
someday...

658
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:40,900
I hope that our fates will
meet on top of the hill.
