1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,150
Excuse me?

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,020
What?

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,740
This is your parent's home isnt it, Akuji-san?

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:10,880
That's right.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,940
You are going home, but why?

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,330
I'm the third Wakame-gumi boss,

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,570
Yamamoto Akuji.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,590
I came to repay you.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,400
DAIAKUJI

10
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,460
Akuji, He finally came here.

11
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,390
He is coming back.

12
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,520
So?

13
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,070
Are you trying to stop him from coming back here?

14
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,800
The ruler has changed.

15
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,260
This country must change too.

16
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,520
You are just a lover...

17
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,530
You don't understand your situation, do you?

18
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,710
Motoko!

19
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,050
She is good for your daughter.

20
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,340
So I assigned her to be an executive here.

21
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,550
Motoko, you...!

22
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,110
Get out of here.

23
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,440
I don't care if you were an executive here before.

24
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
There is no place here for you.

25
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,550
Go home.

26
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,520
Motoko

27
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,140
Show this old man the way back home.

28
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,320
What are you doing?

29
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,590
Hands off of me! Hands off!

30
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,680
Please do whatever she says.

31
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,950
That's the best for you, father.

32
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,390
Motoko, you...

33
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,810
You'll be sorry later, Ran!

34
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,950
Motoko

35
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:10,870
Yes?

36
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:17,080
Do you know the reason I made you, Kaga's daughter, an executive?

37
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,090
I have high expectations for you.

38
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,780
Don't disappoint me.

39
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,570
Look here.

40
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,300
Yeah!

41
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,760
This is the home of the gang.

42
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,950
What should I do?

43
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,540
I'm so nervous and want to pee.

44
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:39,930
Sir

45
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,830
We can't hold back.

46
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,570
You are the one who picked this fight.

47
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,830
Okay!

48
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,630
Let's show the volunteer group's spirit!

49
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,450
Yeah!

50
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,310
Let's do it.

51
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,110
Let's do this.

52
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,920
Where is the bathroom...

53
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,890
Say...

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,790
Are we storming in for a fight?

55
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,760
Why are you standing?

56
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,390
You don't want to die, do you?

57
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,600
You are the boss.

58
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,860
What? What is that?!

59
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,070
I'll kill you!

60
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,550
I'm sorry!

61
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,460
Ah, no.

62
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,380
Where is it?

63
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,690
I see this is the house of the gang.

64
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,260
Let me introduce myself.

65
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,760
Huh?

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,380
My name is Shogoku Hashima.

67
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,380
What?

68
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,190
Done!

69
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,310
Out of arrows.

70
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,950
Does anyone have extras?

71
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,010
No! Stop it!

72
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,680
If you move around, you'll cut yourself.

73
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,060
Let's do it.

74
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,700
Here!

75
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,600
It hurts!

76
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,980
It feels good doing it during battle.

77
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,130
I'm cumming!

78
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,710
No! Don't cum inside!

79
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,580
It felt so good.

80
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,690
I told you not to cum inside.

81
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,190
I thought there would be a bathroom outside.

82
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,260
I hope nobody comes here.

83
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,770
What is that?

84
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,550
No, don't come here.

85
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,540
I can't stop peeing

86
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,690
Smell of...

87
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,770
women!

88
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,040
Hey, Tsujiya.

89
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,740
How's your husband?

90
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,210
We're separated because of you.

91
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,100
My fault?

92
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,190
Please don't.

93
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't play with me.

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,320
A newlywed wife is very tempting.

95
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,400
No!

96
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,610
Stop!

97
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,170
My husband is coming home.

98
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,890
No.

99
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,130
If I cum... If I cum...

100
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,210
My husband...

101
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,710
I'm cumming!

102
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,210
Darling...

103
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,620
You raped somebody's wife.

104
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,340
You are so low!

105
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,800
Your husband came home late.

106
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,740
So I ate you before he did.

107
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,760
Don't treat me as food.

108
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,890
Die, asshole!

109
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,990
You are too young to point the gun at me.

110
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,210
Let me go.

111
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,530
You are as wet as before.

112
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,770
This horrible gang.

113
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,170
You are as tight as before too.

114
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,080
Of couse

115
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,230
I haven't done it since you raped me.

116
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,010
Why?

117
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,590
It's your fault!

118
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,520
No, I hate that...

119
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
You are making me cum agian.

120
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,030
Don't touch, my asshole... you sick fuck.

121
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,200
Stop it!

122
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,150
What are you talking about?

123
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,310
It feels good.

124
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,050
It went in easily.

125
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,280
I'm cumming!

126
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,090
Hey! Toko.

127
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,450
How are you?

128
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,150
I heard you are the executive instead of Kaga.

129
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,770
First of all, why don't you put that away?

130
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,870
When did you come back?

131
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,030
I got out of jail a month ago.

132
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,290
Help me!

133
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,900
Somebody...?!

134
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,070
There is no one to help others here.

135
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,130
Give up.

136
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,230
Please don't. I'm married.

137
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,270
I don't care.

138
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,420
No. Don't!

139
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,180
Please stop it!

140
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,330
Who the hell are you?

141
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,910
Don't interrupt me.

142
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,690
Help me!

143
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,830
Shut up!

144
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,970
I have one months worth of sperm.

145
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,450
No!

146
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,210
Don't! Don't cum inside!

147
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,360
Stop it!

148
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,890
You are disgusting!

149
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,530
Stop it! No!

150
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,640
We only permit labor from men.

151
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,120
Other than that, men are worthless.

152
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,860
Here you go.

153
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,970
Minka-chan, you are always cheerfull.

154
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,450
I can work at this restaurant agian.

155
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,250
I can't get depressed.

156
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,420
Minka-chan, could you take my order?

157
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,840
Okay

158
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,200
Liver, leek pan fry, and ramen, right?

159
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,450
Welcome...

160
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,190
Hey

161
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,010
Huh, Akuji...

162
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,470
Akuji!

163
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,900
I'm glad you are okay.

164
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,650
The war was over but you didn't contact me.

165
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,650
I was in jail.

166
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,690
I came here right after getting out of there.

167
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,620
Forgive me.

168
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,350
Then, you haven't gone back to your home?

169
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,970
Is something wrong with the family?

170
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,950
I see.

171
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,140
Akuji

172
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,030
Please stop being in a gang.

173
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,490
Even if that is your wish, I can't grant it, Minka.

174
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,730
My father was killed in the war and my grandpa is missing.

175
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,740
There is no one else.

176
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,560
Akuji

177
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,070
Why can't I go inside?

178
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,820
This is my house

179
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,630
Well, but its's the order from the boss.

180
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,380
Boss?

181
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,860
Boss

182
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,450
Don't make a fuss. Get out of here.

183
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,060
There is no place for you here.

184
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,000
Weren't you the twenty-sixth lover of my grandpa.

185
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,190
No, you were twenty-seventh?

186
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,940
I'm Ran Ichihashi, the fourth of Wankame-gumi.

187
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,040
I wondered who the boss is.

188
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,870
It's just the lover of my grandpa.

189
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,800
I'm sure I'm better than your father.

190
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,450
I don't care, but this is my house.

191
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,960
I guess you prefer fighting to discussing

192
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,950
Kill him!

193
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,440
Don't hesitate because of me.

194
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,730
Come on fight with your full might!

195
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,080
You will die there.

196
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,040
Why don't you count on your bad luck?

197
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,240
It shouldn't have been this way.

198
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,570
You woke up.

199
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,320
Where am I?

200
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,430
This is the headquaters of the volunteer group.

201
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,840
Even the ambulance won't come, if the patient is a man.

202
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,840
The volunteer group?

203
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,320
We help the people who are unhappy because of the war.

204
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,760
Who are you?

205
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,840
I'm the leader here.

206
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,470
My name is Yoka Aoba.

207
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,600
I see.

208
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,390
When you were raped, was that a part of the volunteer?

209
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,960
No it was not!

210
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,340
I was on the way back from visiting an old woman who lost her son.

211
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,240
To kill the group, I'd better make a new group.

212
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,610
My body is weak after being in jail.

213
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,230
I need to train.

214
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,800
Please stop.

215
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,800
No. Please stop.

216
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,750
You are very wet.

217
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,740
It seems that you've been waiting.

218
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,760
You are so wet.

219
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,590
You've waited for so long, haven't you?

220
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,230
I'm embarrassed.

221
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,470
Don't talk about it.

222
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,440
Then, put it in your mouth.

223
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,210
What? What is it?

224
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,420
What is it?

225
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,990
This.

226
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,180
Wow!

227
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,860
You are good at it.

228
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,320
I'm sorry, my dear husband....

229
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,720
I can't take any more.

230
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,960
I'm cumming!

231
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,580
What is this all about?

232
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,820
I redecorated your office.

233
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,130
Isn't it neat?

234
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,290
I haven't had a Shinto altar for a long time.

235
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,290
Where should I put this?

236
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,260
Mirai-san, Tomoko-san you are helping out. Did you...

237
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,010
Of course, I did.

238
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,780
Don't look. I'm embarrrassed.

239
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,730
Is it your first time?

240
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,150
Yes

241
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,720
I don't think its a good idea.

242
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,080
Yoko will scold me.

243
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,080
She won't get mad at you.

244
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,930
She did the same.

245
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,950
I feel funny.

246
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,130
My body is out of control..

247
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,110
Relax. Mine's the best in the world.

248
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,920
How can i relax?

249
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,750
I'm cumming. Somehow I'm cumming.

250
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,750
Eating is my happiest thing.

251
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,110
I'll teach you another happy thing.

252
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,170
How is it?

253
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,860
I'm happy!

254
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,150
That's the story.

255
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,290
Well, I had a hard time.

256
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,490
I got surrounded by other people while i was talking.

257
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,470
I'm not like before.

258
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,970
I'm in good shape now.

259
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,150
I can play with anyone of you, but prepare yourself.

260
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,250
I'll take your life.

261
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,820
Don't, Toko.

262
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,670
It won't do any good to serve that bitch.

263
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,510
What are you doing?

264
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,900
You haven't gotten rid of him yet?

265
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,540
You are useless.

266
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,730
You finally came out.  I thought you'd run away.

267
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,600
I thought you'd ran away.

268
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,530
What is that?

269
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,550
I called him form Shikoku.

270
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,440
Suteki Ishi, stop laughing. Do your job!

271
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:33,420
It's show time!

272
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,810
A Monster...

273
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,960
Fuck. I should've been more careful.

274
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,690
Knock him out! I'll finish him off!

275
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,010
Shit.

276
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,090
Motoko, what are you doing?

277
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,220
Toko, you..

278
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,210
Run away now.

279
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,650
I'll be back.

280
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,580
He is running away. Follow him, Dekao!

281
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,300
Not this way, not this way!

282
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,340
Let's go, Akuji-san.

283
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,380
Let's go home.

284
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Let me go! Shut up!

285
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,810
I'll pardon you for today.

286
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,170
You disappoint me, Motoko.

287
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,370
If you want to kill me, do it right now.

288
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,770
You are an idiot. I won't let you go that easily.

289
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,210
Boss are you sure about this?

290
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,250
Yeah. Do it from the back or the front as you like.

291
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,470
You are so lucky.

292
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,230
They are both virgins.  Really?

293
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,880
Really?!

294
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,780
I have a hard on already.

295
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,330
Don't think of killing yourself.

296
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,410
If you do something stupid, I'll kill you father.

297
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,660
No!
