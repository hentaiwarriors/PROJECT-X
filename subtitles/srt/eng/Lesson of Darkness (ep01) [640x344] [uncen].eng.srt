1
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,140
﻿Have you heard?

2
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,750
﻿It looks like another
﻿murder happened last night.

3
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,280
﻿I'm so scared!

4
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,120
﻿They say every
﻿victim is a beautiful woman.

5
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,630
﻿You should be careful.

6
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,630
﻿What are you talking about?

7
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,400
﻿You're the one who
﻿should be careful, Azusa.

8
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,100
﻿Especially when you go out at night...

9
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,240
﻿Excuse me?

10
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,810
﻿I don't go out a lot at night.

11
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,080
﻿I just haven't the time lately.

12
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,010
﻿Why?

13
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,610
﻿Actually...

14
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,690
﻿I have this new private teacher.

15
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,420
﻿And you know what?

16
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,590
He's so good-looking.

17
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,590
﻿Again?

18
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
﻿What do you mean by that?

19
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,730
﻿Anyway, he's tall, handsome, and cool.

20
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,730
﻿Hey, hey.

21
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,970
Are you listening?

22
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,440
﻿Miho!

23
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,810
﻿What's wrong?

24
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,840
﻿Can you see him?

25
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,780
﻿Next stop is the private school.

26
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,650
﻿The private school.

27
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,610
﻿Who?

28
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,650
﻿A strange man holding a cat.

29
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,250
﻿Please be careful as you step down.

30
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,760
﻿Thank you very much.

31
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,960
﻿Let's go.

32
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,810
﻿Good morning.

33
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,010
﻿Good morning.

34
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,070
﻿Great!

35
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,910
﻿You're always so good.

36
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,760
﻿What's wrong?

37
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,570
﻿It's nothing.

38
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,040
﻿Are you okay?

39
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
﻿Azusa, what's this?

40
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,140
﻿You're talking about this stone?

41
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,580
﻿Remember when we
﻿went to Karuizawa last time?

42
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,210
﻿I picked it up then.

43
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,980
﻿Pretty, isn't it?

44
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,450
﻿Yes...

45
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,450
﻿Miho?

46
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,160
﻿Hey, Miho!

47
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,530
﻿What's wrong?

48
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,530
﻿Everybody's gone already.

49
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,570
﻿Well, can you give me this stone?

50
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,770
﻿What?

51
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,170
﻿Why not?

52
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,740
﻿It's just something I found.

53
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,680
﻿But why do you want it?

54
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,880
﻿I'm just kind of interested in it.

55
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,350
﻿It's not just an ornament, there's
﻿something mysterious about it.

56
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,420
﻿I always feel relaxed when
﻿I look into a beautiful stone...

57
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,520
﻿Oh, I have a pretty stone, too.

58
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,260
﻿All right, all right.

59
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,790
﻿Whatever.

60
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,600
﻿I have to go.

61
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,800
﻿W-Wait a moment, Azusa!

62
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,770
﻿Hey, Azusa!

63
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,950
﻿Sorry, I have to go somewhere.

64
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,580
﻿Okay, take care of yourself.

65
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,450
﻿See you.

66
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,680
﻿My goodness!

67
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,250
﻿I didn't expect it to take this long.

68
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,350
﻿It was that cat again.

69
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,160
﻿I was so scared.

70
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,660
﻿I was asked a lot of
﻿questions by the police.

71
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,630
﻿And?

72
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,100
﻿Of course, I told them everything I saw.

73
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,380
﻿But they said the
﻿cat didn't kill anyone...

74
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,050
﻿I think that man did it.

75
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,520
﻿Remember, yesterday he
﻿was in the bus watching us...

76
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,860
﻿The cat he held was the
﻿same cat I saw last night.

77
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,200
﻿I'm positive...

78
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,370
﻿Are you listening to me?

79
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,400
﻿What?

80
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,370
﻿O-Of course.

81
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,180
﻿Are you thinking about a guy again?

82
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,110
﻿I told you yesterday.

83
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,280
﻿My private teacher is coming.

84
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,390
﻿I'm thinking about seducing him.

85
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,920
﻿You're kidding me.

86
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,150
﻿You come here to pick me up?

87
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,160
Miho, this is my
﻿private teacher, Mr. Inoue.

88
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,060
﻿This is my friend, Miho Murakami.

89
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,430
﻿H-Hello.

90
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,840
﻿See you tomorrow.

91
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,780
﻿The bus is too late.

92
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,000
﻿Jeez, aren't I attractive enough?

93
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,510
﻿Azusa.

94
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,880
﻿Y-Yes?

95
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,780
﻿I have something to ask you.

96
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,980
﻿About what?

97
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,420
﻿You picked up a beautiful
﻿stone at Karuizawa, didn't you?

98
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,260
What?

99
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,520
﻿It's very important.

100
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,160
﻿Please think about it seriously.

101
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,170
﻿A stone...

102
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,740
﻿A pretty stone at Karuizawa.

103
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,440
﻿Yes.

104
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,170
﻿A pretty stone that shines blue.

105
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,540
﻿Come to think of it, I
﻿remember something like that.

106
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,080
﻿Where is it now?

107
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,210
﻿Let me see...

108
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,450
﻿Where could it be...

109
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,250
﻿Azusa!

110
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,560
﻿Take it easy.

111
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,890
I don't have it right now.

112
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,930
﻿Then where is it?

113
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,550
﻿Let's sit on the sofa and talk about It.

114
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,890
﻿Well, Mr. Inoue...

115
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,190
﻿about the stone, don't you?

116
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,190
You want to know

117
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,860
﻿I can tell you about it.

118
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,930
﻿In return...

119
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,440
...﻿would you do what I want?

120
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,110
﻿Well...

121
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,680
...﻿Mr. Inoue.

122
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,690
﻿Mr. Inoue.

123
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,470
﻿Hey, you're so hard already.

124
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,990
﻿It's wonderful!

125
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,940
﻿Mr. inoue, please lick me.

126
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,670
﻿So good...

127
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,370
﻿So good...

128
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,040
﻿The stone...

129
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,940
﻿The stone...

130
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,010
﻿I-I gave it...

131
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,780
﻿I gave it to Miho!

132
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,450
﻿More, more!

133
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,030
﻿I-I'm coming.

134
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,640
﻿Mr. Inoue...

135
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,800
﻿Hello?

136
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,740
﻿Hello?

137
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,980
﻿Azusa...

138
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,230
﻿He's...

139
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,200
﻿He's the sex beast.

140
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,010
﻿He killed Azusa.

141
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,900
﻿Wait!

142
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,800
﻿Open the door!

143
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,770
﻿Please, open the door!

144
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,140
﻿Mr. Inoue!

145
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,280
﻿Wait!

146
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,310
﻿Mr. Inoue, please help me!

147
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,480
﻿That man...

148
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,230
﻿Stay away from him!

149
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,410
﻿Stop...

150
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,220
﻿Miho.

151
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,620
﻿He is looking for the Dark Stone.

152
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,090
﻿The Dark Stone?

153
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,890
﻿The Stone you got from Azusa.

154
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,430
﻿He approached Azusa
﻿and tried to take the stone.

155
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,770
﻿And, he killed her.

156
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,410
﻿You have the Dark Stone, don't you?

157
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,550
﻿I need it now.

158
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,000
﻿Finally...

159
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,360
﻿Finally, I have the Dark Stone.

160
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,740
﻿You...

161
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,810
﻿You killed...

162
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,040
﻿You killed Azusa!

163
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,480
﻿You'll pay for that!

164
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,780
﻿Please, listen to me.

165
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,650
﻿I didn't kill her.

166
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,320
﻿You're the sex beast.

167
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,690
﻿That's obvious.

168
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:06,500
﻿Yes. I'm a sex beast,
﻿but I didn't kill anybody.

169
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,400
﻿You saw, didn't you?

170
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,340
﻿Inoue's true nature.

171
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,180
﻿He's a sex beast, too.

172
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,880
﻿I was chasing him.

173
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,920
﻿I came here to kill him.

174
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,400
﻿It wasn't you who killed Azusa, was it?

175
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,040
﻿You aren't the serial killer.

176
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,880
﻿No, he is the criminal.

177
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,510
﻿Then why was that
﻿cat always at the scene?

178
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,820
﻿Because I have been chasing him.

179
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:06,790
﻿Sex beasts have taken human
﻿energy to survive for a long time...

180
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,360
﻿But we never kill human beings...

181
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:21,140
﻿...because we would die
﻿if our food source died out.

182
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,610
﻿We have co-existed with you always...

183
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:35,020
﻿However, now there is a special
﻿sex beast, whose aim is to kill humans.

184
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:41,130
﻿I have to kill him for our race.

185
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,470
﻿I have to take back the stone, too.

186
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
﻿What is the stone?

187
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,840
﻿That stone is the Dark Stone,
﻿handed down for a long, long time.

188
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,840
﻿The Dark Stone?

189
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,850
﻿The Dark Stone
﻿gives us unlimited power.

190
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,760
﻿He tried to get the
﻿stone when it was sealed.

191
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,700
﻿I got in his way, and we began to fight.

192
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,140
I tried to take back the Dark Stone.

193
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:07,380
﻿We couldn't approach because it
﻿was protected by a mysterious power.

194
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,680
﻿It was the power of the Bright Stone.

195
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:18,190
﻿The Bright Stone is
﻿dangerous, because it can kill us.

196
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:27,300
﻿So, he couldn't approach Azusa
﻿easily because he was afraid of the stone.

197
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,400
﻿But, she was killed.

198
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:36,740
﻿She didn't have the Bright Stone.

199
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,710
﻿The person who has the stone is...

200
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,180
﻿...you.

201
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:50,060
﻿At that time, only you were near Azusa.

202
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
﻿It can't be...

203
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,860
﻿The Bright Stone.

204
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
﻿I'm positive.

205
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,630
﻿You must have it.

206
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,790
﻿There is a stone in my charm.

207
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,290
﻿Where is it?

208
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,130
﻿In my pouch.

209
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,090
﻿Shit, now he has it.

210
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,570
﻿That's right!

211
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,200
﻿It's in my locker from yesterday!

212
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,340
﻿You left it there?

213
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,270
﻿Yes.

214
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,340
﻿Let's go!

215
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,330
Found it!

216
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,660
﻿We can get rid of him with this.

217
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,620
﻿Yeah.

218
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,990
﻿I can avenge Azusa, can't I?

219
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,860
﻿That's right.

220
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,560
﻿Let's go.

221
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,600
﻿I have to hurry...

222
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,500
﻿Wait!

223
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,670
﻿I'll fight with you.

224
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,910
﻿Here.

225
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,360
﻿Finally, I have unlimited power!

226
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,040
﻿Now!

227
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,620
﻿Hurry up!

228
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,430
﻿Hurry up!

229
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,530
﻿Shoot!

230
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,340
﻿Thank you.

231
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,540
﻿Thanks to you, I could
﻿take revenge for Azusa.

232
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,540
﻿You...

233
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,480
﻿I've reached the end of my life.

234
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,080
﻿Don't say that

235
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,280
﻿What can I do for you?

236
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,090
﻿I know!

237
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,660
﻿If you take my energy...

238
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,500
﻿I can't do that

239
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,500
﻿You're a sex beast...

240
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,310
...﻿but you fought for us.

241
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,190
﻿This is the one thing I can do for you.
