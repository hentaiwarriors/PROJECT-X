1
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:14,989
No!

2
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:17,253
- Please don't!
- Shut up!

3
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:19,456
No!

4
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:22,234
Don't touch me!

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,941
I've got a feeling that Tomoko will die.

6
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:33,635
No she won't, Moe. Tomoko...

7
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:39,511
Don't be so rough. It hurts.

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,985
It really hurts!

9
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:51,128
It's horrible.

10
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:56,591
Rie, we are your protectors.
That's the least the girls can do.

11
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:04,975
- Please, one person...
- Stop begging!

12
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:06,635
Don't expect a break from us.

13
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:10,278
Wasn't it you who volunteered
this to save Moe?

14
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:15,819
No!

15
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:21,650
If we take her outside,
we'll be discovered by the enemies.

16
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:26,165
Civilians are all softies.
Why don't you just get it over with?

17
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:33,203
Too deep!

18
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,967
That's too deep.

19
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:39,145
Hurry it up, Sergeant!

20
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:41,840
Don't hustle me like that, Hosokawa.

21
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:43,538
Please, don't be so rough.

22
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:49,916
Moe, don't look.

23
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:54,693
Sergeant, what if the higher-ups
at the main force find out about this?

24
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:59,357
Fukushima! Do you want Kiyone
to take the place of Tomoko?

25
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,567
No! I can't take it!

26
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:13,771
A good tight fit, you've got.

27
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:15,648
I'm coming!

28
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:34,125
It's okay. Tomoko's okay.
Don't worry about it, Moe.

29
00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:39,128
Those assholes, taking advantage of...

30
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:44,402
Next! Go for it, Asano.

31
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:46,345
Hurry up!

32
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:47,444
Get down!

33
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:50,514
Damn, where is he?

34
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:52,151
Hosokawa, lower your head!

35
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:55,379
Fuck! This guy must've followed us.

36
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,467
At the end of World War II,
after dividing up the nation...

37
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:12,936
the countries that defeated Japan
failed to rule the island.

38
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:17,173
As a result, many independent powers
were established...

39
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:20,413
fighting amongst each other
and trying to seize control.

40
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:22,910
They developed a hatred
of one another...

41
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:27,144
leading the country into
a never-ending spiral of a civil war.

42
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,583
The women, whose families were killed
by the opposing powers...

43
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:32,157
began their miserable journey.

44
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,485
With the surviving soldiers,
they searched for the main force...

45
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:39,292
so that they could rejoin it,
but they didn't know where to find it.

46
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:44,529
Dark Shell: Lust in the Cage

47
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:48,297
When Paradise is Lost

48
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:05,280
All quiet from here
to the train station building.

49
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:08,726
Having these civilians makes it hard.

50
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:10,762
All right, let's go.

51
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,731
- I'm sorry, but, Moe...
- What, Tomoko?

52
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:16,593
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:20,270
Got to piss? Piss right here and now!

54
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,672
Hey, that's not nice, Hosokawa!

55
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:24,332
Leave it, Kiyone!

56
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:27,837
You shouldn't even dare to suggest that!

57
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:30,509
Hosokawa! Shut up!

58
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,013
It's nature's call. Not much we can do.

59
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:42,754
Do they know the danger we're in?

60
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:45,291
No more shots? Maybe he gave up.

61
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,199
Moe...

62
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,707
Kaoruko! Are you up?

63
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:03,110
As usual, that morning,
Keita came by on the way to school.

64
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:09,653
As if that event was a long-ago memory,
everyone had gone back to the old routine.

65
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:15,987
Although Keita was younger
than I was, he always said he'd marry me.

66
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:21,026
Both my father and my mother
loved the idea.

67
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:26,471
Well, he was a good man,
I didn't' think it was a bad idea.

68
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:31,571
Every time there was a battle,
we lost more friends.

69
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,937
Some of us lost family members.

70
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:37,839
Many of the older students
volunteered to fight in the war.

71
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:43,947
Get down! All of you!

72
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:48,416
Hold your fire!

73
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:52,490
Who knows when we can
find them the next time.

74
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,657
Just carry as much food as possible.

75
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:58,369
Rie, have you seen Kiyone around?

76
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,902
You want to know about Kiyone?

77
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,143
It's all about nature's call.

78
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:09,172
No, don't come in. Please don't.

79
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:11,911
I get the feeling
your wound a little tight.

80
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:16,813
Please don't, Hosokawa.
Right now, I'm going...

81
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:19,589
What fun!

82
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,725
You couldn't wait?

83
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:26,128
Let me clean it up for you.

84
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:27,765
Kiyone!

85
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:31,393
It's you, Fukushima.
You're here to fuck that woman?

86
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:34,872
Please leave Kiyone alone, Hosokawa.

87
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,507
Fukushima...

88
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:40,443
Don't you dare order me around!
Unlike you, I've lived through real battles.

89
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:43,182
What's going on!

90
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,544
Just a second, Yuka.
You're not going to intervene, are you?

91
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:51,415
No! Help me, Fukushima!

92
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:53,555
Kiyone!

93
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:55,485
It's okay. It's okay.

94
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:57,485
Soldiers...

95
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:00,227
Stop it, Kuroda.

96
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,927
We need some outlets.
Don't make me tell you that again.

97
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,170
Kiyone, will she die?

98
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,997
Never. No one will be killed.

99
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:11,907
Help me, Fukushima.

100
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:16,073
Don't be so uptight!
We can still have fun together!

101
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,381
Why don't you fuck that girl!

102
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:20,546
Let's go.

103
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:26,582
Fukushima!

104
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:29,126
You're lucky.
What a nice boyfriend you've got.

105
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,862
Stop it! I hate you! I hate you!

106
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:44,504
Is Kiyone...

107
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:50,507
Yuka!

108
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:52,549
Rie...

109
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:58,380
No! Stop it, someone!

110
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,483
Don't listen, Moe.

111
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,552
Don't watch! Not like this!

112
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:07,996
You smell a little ripe.
When did you take a bath last?

113
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,368
Stop it! You're gross!

114
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,836
Stop it! It's dirty.

115
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:21,741
No, it's embarrassing!

116
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:36,752
I'll teach you what it tastes like.

117
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:55,275
Tell me. Do you like the way
that you taste?

118
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:58,313
Stop!

119
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,653
No, don't take it off!

120
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:06,084
You pervert! I'll tell
everyone what you've done!

121
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,253
You know, I like obedient women.
Now, shut up!

122
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,366
What have we here?

123
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,565
Hello girls.

124
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,237
Your nipples are getting hard.

125
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:25,902
Let's give them a little lick.

126
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:35,352
Not there!

127
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:37,089
You're gushing.

128
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,153
Are you doing it with Fukushima everyday?

129
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:43,190
Don't touch me. Please let me go.

130
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:46,130
We're comrades. Don't hate me so much.

131
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:57,766
I'll make you forget
that weakling, right now.

132
00:09:58,244 --> 00:10:01,645
Fukushima, help me!

133
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:05,917
It's so big, please!

134
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,248
No, don't move.

135
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:19,627
No, not there!

136
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:29,472
How does it feel
compared to Fukushima?

137
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:30,631
It's good!

138
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:39,006
You're big!

139
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:43,280
It's making me wild.

140
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:50,426
Fukushima, I don't want to feel it!
Help me!

141
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,333
How's that? Much better than him, right?

142
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:01,132
Yeah! Take it, take it all!

143
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:06,443
It's like doing it with a virgin.

144
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,949
More!

145
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:25,163
I can't bear it, it's so hot!

146
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,459
It's so great, I'm melting!

147
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:31,893
Getting hot enough for you?

148
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:33,761
It's so hot!

149
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:39,266
More.

150
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,728
I'm coming! I'm coming!

151
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:05,760
Faster!

152
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,146
Sounds like Hosokawa had a lot of fun.

153
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:30,227
I bet that softy, Fukushima,
knows what it's like to be in a battle.

154
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,529
Let's go, Moe.

155
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:34,559
Hey, where you going?

156
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,760
There might be enemies around.
You can't just leave.

157
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:39,126
Kiyone.

158
00:12:57,857 --> 00:12:59,381
I'm sorry, Moe.

159
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:02,586
I really didn't want you to see
the horrible look on Kiyone's face.

160
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:05,387
Are you telling me we'll all die?

161
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,289
No, that's not true.

162
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,661
We'll survive and join our friends, okay?

163
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,199
Please wait, Kiyone.

164
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:20,844
I can't turn against a veteran soldier.
Please understand.

165
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,542
Shut up!

166
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,352
Kiyone!

167
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:47,004
Kaoruko, will you help me over here?

168
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:50,101
That's my mom,
getting the laundry done...

169
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:53,077
in the bright sunshine
of an early summer's day.

170
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:57,347
The gentle breeze stirred the firm
petals of the rhododendrons.

171
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,875
Although everyday seemed to pass...

172
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:04,446
as if things remained the same,
our lives changed slowly and surely.

173
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:07,383
One day, Keita said to me...

174
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:11,122
"I'm going to join the army,
and I'll protect you, Kaoruko!"

175
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:15,966
I laughed and said, "How could you?
You're younger than I am."

176
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:19,499
"But all the adolescent boys
dreamed of being soldiers."

177
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,999
Having fun?

178
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:35,919
Kuroda, it's good, it's really good.
You're the best!

179
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:40,420
A lot deeper. Make me feel wild.

180
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:51,768
So, you lost both your mother
and father during that attack?

181
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:54,372
Yes. And Moe was raped.

182
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:57,606
Since then, her memory is messed up.

183
00:14:57,777 --> 00:15:00,109
I don't want her to experience that again.

184
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:03,648
My job, from now on, is to protect her.

185
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:09,878
That's why you stepped forward.
To protect Moe.

186
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:14,491
Yuka, it's okay. You can cry.

187
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:28,938
Good. It's deep.

188
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,846
You're making me feel wild, good!

189
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,038
You're good too, Aki.

190
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:41,519
It's so good!

191
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,654
Kiyone!

192
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:51,121
Yuka, both your child and husband.

193
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,523
When the town was attacked,
we got separated. I tried to find them.

194
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:59,000
But I believe they escaped
and are with the main force.

195
00:15:59,472 --> 00:16:02,464
Is it true?
Can we really join them?

196
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:06,677
The way it is,
we'll all either be killed or violated.

197
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:12,449
When push comes to shove,
let's escape alone without them.

198
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,809
Kuroda...

199
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:22,584
I can't take it anymore!

200
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:30,094
- It's tight!
- So hot I'm melting!

201
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:34,795
Come in deeper!

202
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,233
Kiyone!

203
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:12,144
Hey, you! Everything's quiet, right?

204
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:16,476
- All right then, it's my shift.
- Yes.

205
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:19,144
Kiyone's gone.

206
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:21,482
No need to keep it to yourself.

207
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:35,858
I just remembered.

208
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:44,042
Fukushima? Are you okay?

209
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,144
I was worried about you.

210
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:54,584
Rie...

211
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,618
You, bitch!

212
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:00,256
It was your fault that Kiyone was...

213
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:04,319
Stop it, Fukushima!
Please don't! Calm down.

214
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:13,765
Fukushima's been out there,
standing guard.

215
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,602
He's stressed out, don't interfere.

216
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:17,866
Moe!

217
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:23,308
All right, go for it, Fukushima.

218
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:24,246
Kuroda.

219
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:28,149
- No, I'm sorry. Forgive me.
- Kiyone's gone.

220
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:30,744
No, don't.

221
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:37,354
A pathetic man and a timid woman.
What a perfect match.

222
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:43,958
There was nothing we could do,
and I was scared.

223
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,196
Make no mistake about it.
Someone came by.

224
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:50,398
Crap! He's still following us.

225
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:53,168
I won't let him escape this time.

226
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:56,815
Let's split and search around
the school building. Don't lower your guard.

227
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:05,246
No, don't! Please don't!
Fukushima, please!

228
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:13,696
That's right. You won't survive
if you can't forget the dead.

229
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:21,165
Don't! Stop, please!

230
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,870
Fukushima! Fukushima!

231
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:27,270
Stop your whining!
If you don't lead me out of here...

232
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:33,542
- It hurts! You'll tear it off! It hurts!
- You're selfish, Fukushima!

233
00:19:33,686 --> 00:19:35,677
Want to give up Moe instead?

234
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:38,951
Unless he goes all the way,
he won't calm down.

235
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,150
See, look at his rage.

236
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,224
It was my fault. I apologize!

237
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:50,561
Kiyone won't return.

238
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:59,803
- I want to go home! Mommy...
- Shut up!

239
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:04,305
Fukushima's finally becoming a man.

240
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:10,913
Put it in your mouth.

241
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:47,015
It's coming. Drink it!

242
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,569
You bitch! I told you to drink it.

243
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:05,242
I thought Fukushima
was the submissive kind. Guess not.

244
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:10,538
I'm sorry. I'll drink it next time.

245
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:15,115
I'm sorry. Moe...

246
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:20,653
No, don't come near me.

247
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:28,929
Yuka, help me. Help me!

248
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:31,661
No please don't, I don't want it.

249
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,603
What're you saying? I just got started.

250
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:38,704
Isn't it enough, Kuroda?

251
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:41,245
Fukushima says he just got started.

252
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:45,616
No, don't take it off, please!

253
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:49,480
- It's embarrassing, no!
- Shut up!

254
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:58,051
A loud woman.

255
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:05,566
Disgusting. Not at all like Kiyone.

256
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:12,643
No, I'm scared!

257
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:19,482
It hurts, please pull it out!

258
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:26,754
No, don't, it hurts!

259
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:30,895
Stop acting as if you're in pain,
instead, why don't you enjoy it?

260
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:33,463
Please pull it out!

261
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:41,872
Stop, please, stop!

262
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:44,442
Please, it hurts, please, don't!

263
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:54,415
No, not like this, no!

264
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:59,984
Fukushima, I love you!

265
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:12,393
I'm hot, it's good.

266
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:15,032
Fukushima!

267
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:21,670
Fukushima, push more, my body...

268
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:26,206
Disgusting, it's responding shamelessly.

269
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:30,511
Feels good.

270
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:39,624
I can't stand it! I can't stand it!

271
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:46,798
I'm coming!

272
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:59,017
They get me excited.

273
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,611
Why don't we have some fun, too?

274
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:06,956
- Let's go, Fukushima.
- Yes, sir.

275
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:11,294
We're all going to die, aren't we?

276
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:16,025
That's not true. If we're together,
I'll protect you. I will.

277
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:25,904
We must escape, get away from them.

278
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,172
- What's up?
- See there.

279
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:32,481
Hosokawa?

280
00:24:38,357 --> 00:24:40,518
Keita and I visited a beach together.

281
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:43,560
It was our last trip before Keita
joined the army.

282
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:46,420
We did it because once
he became a soldier...

283
00:24:46,732 --> 00:24:49,200
we wouldn't be able to
see each other very often.

284
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:52,627
I was surprised to see
his muscular body.

285
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,201
He was so gorgeous that it was hard
to keep my face straight.

286
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,706
An empty beach in the early summer.

287
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:01,775
When he held me tenderly
I felt like telling him to do...

288
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:06,214
what his heart desired,
but all he did was to kiss me gently.

289
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:16,022
Wait! Rie's...

290
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,489
Don't give up!

291
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:29,335
Before they catch up with us,
let's join the main force.

292
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:32,439
The main force, are we really
on the right path?

293
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:37,813
Rie, we've come this far.
We're almost there.

294
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:41,414
You don't want them to violate you
anymore, do you?

295
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:42,551
No.

296
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:51,755
What happened? Killed again?

297
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:57,493
Got killed on her own. It's not our fault.

298
00:25:57,803 --> 00:25:59,737
Be quiet, Fukushima.

299
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:04,571
That's what happens
when you walk around without us.

300
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:06,235
Rie, she's dead.

301
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:57,319
In the next episode

302
00:27:57,656 --> 00:28:00,420
In a dream, I was at a beach with Keita.

303
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:04,494
There was a cute little girl
who ran right in front of us.

304
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:06,796
"Hey, Keita," I said.

305
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:10,000
"Wouldn't it be nice
if we could have a girl like her?"

306
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:13,900
Let's see. Our girl's name
would be, how about Moe?

307
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:16,471
Recovering my consciousness
in the cold rubble...

308
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:18,475
I aim at the next target.

309
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:23,874
Dark Shell: Lust in the Cage.

310
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:28,050
Episode 2: Skin That Cries.

311
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:32,814
Dark Shell: Lust in the Cage
Episode 2: Skin that Cries
