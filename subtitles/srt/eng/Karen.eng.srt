1
00:00:12,626 --> 00:00:17,359
Hurray, hurray To-Ai!

2
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:19,695
Hurray hurray To-Ai.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,865
Hurray hurray To-Ai.

4
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:42,314
What's wrong with you guys?

5
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:45,654
You sound dead out there.

6
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:49,593
You need to have more spirit out there!

7
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,868
Do you understand?!

8
00:00:57,337 --> 00:01:02,104
Ryo, we can't keep up with you anymore.

9
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:04,475
What?

10
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:08,377
Shut up,
you're not the captain of this squad!

11
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:19,385
Everyone wants to quit
the cheering squad along with me.

12
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:20,551
Huh?!

13
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:24,660
You demand too much from us.

14
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:29,726
You're not serious?

15
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:33,169
Yes...

16
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:37,736
We can't take it anymore.

17
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:41,779
Let's get the hell out of here.

18
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:44,916
Wait, wait.

19
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:51,256
lt would look bad for you
if we quit in middle of a game.

20
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:57,128
The squad's long ninety year history
end with you, captain.

21
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:02,800
Wait!

22
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:07,567
Please, you really aren't serious about this?

23
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:15,212
lt's too bad that the district head
of the cheering squad is watching.

24
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:16,510
What?

25
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:22,388
Don't do this.
l promise to be a better captain.

26
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:25,318
lf you insist.....

27
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:39,462
Get away!

28
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:41,732
l see...

29
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:49,513
You're supposed to be this tough girl,
but that's just an act, isn't it.

30
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,074
What do you mean.....

31
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:56,853
lf you want us to accept you
as our captain...

32
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:01,953
you'll have to prove yourself.

33
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:17,207
Can you finish the rest of the game
with this vibrator inside you?

34
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:23,675
lf you can keep waving the school flag
and cheer perfectly...

35
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,914
we will accept you as our captain.

36
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,054
Right guys?

37
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:33,520
That's right.

38
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:37,558
<i>I can't let them win like this!</i>

39
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:39,798
<i>I have to do this.</i>

40
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,664
l'll do it.

41
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:46,733
That's all l have to do?

42
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:48,970
Hand it over.

43
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:52,807
No, we'll help you, captain.

44
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,072
-Right?
-Right.

45
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:58,048
Wait a second...

46
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:15,262
Don't fuck up by having an orgasm.

47
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,441
We have to go back out there now.

48
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:42,158
Hurray, hurray, To-Ai.

49
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:47,292
Hurray, hurray, To-Ai, hurray, hurray, To-Ai.

50
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:52,162
Hurray, hurray, To-Ai.

51
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:56,766
Hurray, hurray, To-Ai, hurray, hurray, To-Ai.

52
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:09,648
Hurray, hurray, To-Ai.

53
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:14,123
Hurray, hurray, To-Ai, hurray, hurray, To-Ai.

54
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:19,091
<i>I can't...</i>

55
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:21,957
<i>The district head...</i>

56
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:25,128
<i>Mr. Akagi's watching me.</i>

57
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,900
<i>I have to finish this.</i>

58
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:36,981
Cheering Squad

59
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:42,811
You guys were kind of sad
during the first half...

60
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:46,325
but you really got going
during the second half...

61
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:48,759
when Ryo really started waving the flag.

62
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:49,988
Thank you!

63
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,358
No, thank Ryo.

64
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:52,557
Yes.

65
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:54,995
You did well.

66
00:05:56,536 --> 00:06:00,097
Waving the flag for 50 minutes
is a lot of work.

67
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:04,375
Just like the captain tryouts.

68
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:06,137
Yes.

69
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:11,411
This squad is usually only
reserved for the guys...

70
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:15,147
but you waved the flag the longest,
beating everyone else.

71
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,390
There were a lot of objections.

72
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:22,851
lt was a great decision, though.

73
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:25,153
Thank you very much.

74
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,905
l have to go; l know you will continue
to be a great squad captain.

75
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:37,404
Of course!

76
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:19,876
<i>Continue as captain...</i>

77
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,187
<i>Can I really continue to lead the squad</i>
<i>effectively after what happened today?</i>

78
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,024
What?!

79
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,567
Captain, we really have to talk.

80
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,104
l think it can wait!

81
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:43,235
lt's really urgent.

82
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:45,607
Fine, l'll get dressed right now.

83
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,413
Shit, what a bastard!

84
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:50,681
Wait...

85
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,378
Where's my uniform;
what is this doing here...

86
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:58,288
l think you would look much better
in that uniform.

87
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,351
Dojima....

88
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:05,497
You had better give me my regular uniform
for the squad right now!

89
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:07,591
l mean it!

90
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,266
What's wrong with that?

91
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:13,299
Shut up! Give it back!

92
00:08:14,174 --> 00:08:17,735
Besides, we need you to do something
important for the squad.

93
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:24,842
We want you to join the cheerleading
squad for just a few days.

94
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:27,143
l'm not a cheerleader!

95
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:30,089
lt's really not that different.

96
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:33,523
The fundamental concept
is the same, right?

97
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:34,715
What do you...?

98
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:39,523
You don't feel that
they are as legitimate as we are?

99
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,364
l didn't say that!

100
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:46,297
l think it's best for both squads...

101
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:49,773
if we improve our relationship
with the cheerleading squad.

102
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:51,869
Stop that!

103
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:56,573
l don't think you're in a position to argue.

104
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:01,748
You can't have us all quit, can you?

105
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:12,192
Besides, you really are the only one in the
squad that can do this, am l correct?

106
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:19,632
lt's the captain's job
to improve squad relations, Ryo.

107
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:27,537
<i>Isn't that Ryo?</i>

108
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:32,109
<i>I thought she was part of</i>
<i>the Male Cheering Squad?</i>

109
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:34,409
<i>Did she switch to cheerleading?</i>

110
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:40,991
<i>I think she looks pretty hot</i>
<i>in that uniform, don't you?</i>

111
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,066
Captain, you're walking kind of funny.

112
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:52,560
What?

113
00:09:57,477 --> 00:10:01,379
l know you're not used to skirts;
you must be uncomfortable.

114
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:03,406
None of your business!

115
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:05,807
No, let me help you.

116
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,251
-This should help you out.
-No, Stop!

117
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:20,497
How are you, Ryo and Dojima!

118
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:21,722
Hi Aki.

119
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:24,567
Ryo, you look good!

120
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:26,930
lt's cute on you!

121
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:34,337
lt's easy--
just do what they want you to do.

122
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,576
l'll keep your captain's uniform safe.

123
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:43,616
We're counting on you, captain.

124
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:50,559
Ok, 1!

125
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:58,493
Okay, stop!

126
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:00,304
Come on, Ryo!

127
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,208
You have to kick your legs up
higher than that!

128
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:07,636
Just like this!

129
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:13,443
Waving flags does absolutely
nothing for your flexibility.

130
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,223
Would you two show her
flexibility exercises?

131
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:23,317
Sure!

132
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:30,733
Ryo, flexibility is really important.

133
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,941
You can't cheer properly
if you're wooden like this.

134
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:40,412
Don't!

135
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,205
What are you doing?

136
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:45,310
We're not hurting you!

137
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:48,949
We have to do the other side now.

138
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:50,852
Wait!

139
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,789
Oh my Ryo!

140
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:59,731
You're not wearing any underwear!

141
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:05,662
And you're all squishy!

142
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:09,139
What were you thinking about?

143
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,936
l think we can take care of this.

144
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,911
-Over here.
-Yes!

145
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:19,745
This is how we punish bad conduct!

146
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:21,711
Stop!

147
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:23,578
No, don't!

148
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:29,350
Please!

149
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:44,235
Hey Ryo, is this vibrator yours?

150
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,777
That's not!

151
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:57,218
l'm not done with you yet!

152
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,420
No!

153
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:02,125
Stop!

154
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:15,831
You're still soaking wet down here,
you little slut!

155
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,275
l think l'm coming!

156
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:42,000
Ryo, eat my pussy.

157
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:43,257
What?

158
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:45,998
You don't want to taste my pussy?

159
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,232
B...but...

160
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:56,613
lf you don't, l'll stop what l'm doing.

161
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:02,276
l'll pull this out.

162
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,684
Your choice.

163
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:09,825
l'll do it!

164
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:14,290
l'll eat your pussy, so please don't stop!

165
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:18,767
Okay, l love getting my pussy licked.

166
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:29,844
Just like that,
tongue fuck me just like that.

167
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,715
l'm going to come!

168
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:45,291
You're really starting to like this,
aren't you?

169
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,223
l can't take anymore!

170
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,620
l'm... l'm coming!

171
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,767
l'm going to come, too!

172
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:41,309
Few days later

173
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,583
More, more!

174
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:58,767
l think you did a great job
at improving squad relations, captain.

175
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:03,738
You know about the rugby team, right?

176
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:12,741
They're at the bottom of the district.

177
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,614
They have not won a single game yet.

178
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:19,257
They need to win a game
for the athletic department...

179
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:22,783
to get full funding of
all the teams and squads.

180
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:26,758
Part of that money goes
toward supporting our squad.

181
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:33,432
l have a great idea that would make sure
we get full funding for everybody.

182
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:36,700
Rugby Team

183
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:48,648
Excuse me,
but l have an announcement to make.

184
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:51,622
The cheer squad has an offer to make.

185
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:53,049
Huh?

186
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:58,155
To all the players that score in the game...

187
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:03,526
our captain will gladly reward you
after the game with her body!

188
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:05,697
Right on!

189
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,367
l...l didn't agree to this!

190
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:11,569
You'll be helping the whole school out.

191
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:13,000
l can't.

192
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:17,243
You don't want the squad
to get fully funded?

193
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,975
They're losing....this might help.

194
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:46,634
Captain, hey, look over here!

195
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,886
She's waiting to reward you guys!

196
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:57,983
All right!

197
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:03,722
Hurray, hurray To-Ai!

198
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:07,755
Hurray, hurray To-Ai, hurray, hurray To-Ai!

199
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:14,005
Does she need vibrators on her nipples?

200
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:17,935
l thought the guys might like it.

201
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:21,106
See, they're winning the game now.

202
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:24,841
<i>I can't take this any more!</i>

203
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:34,393
<i>I think I'm going to faint!</i>

204
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,127
<i>No more!</i>

205
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:50,265
You're awake now!

206
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:55,075
Thanks to you,
the rugby team won the game!

207
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:03,682
l think someone needs to
keep their end of the promise.

208
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:06,516
This is fucking great!

209
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:10,524
No, Don't!

210
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:14,532
l never would have guessed
that she was such a hottie!

211
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,970
You think she can handle all of us?

212
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:12,520
She's good at blow jobs.

213
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,657
She's really tight.

214
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:33,108
l'll try out her ass!

215
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:42,010
Wait, not there!

216
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:48,418
Her ass is super tight!

217
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:54,993
She's really starting to get into this!

218
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,287
She likes sucking cock!

219
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:20,552
l thought she was a frigid bitch,
but she's all right!

220
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:23,392
This feels good!

221
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:27,023
l want more!

222
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:30,524
Fuck me!

223
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:32,868
Please, fuck me!

224
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:48,511
<i>I don't know why...</i>

225
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,754
<i>this feels so good.</i>

226
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,084
Shit, l'm gonna come!

227
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:06,561
<i>Am I just a slutty whore?</i>

228
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:09,367
<i>Have I become corrupted?</i>

229
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:12,639
Few days later

230
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:16,880
l don't know about joining the squad.

231
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:18,444
Me too....

232
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:22,047
l heard the captain was really tough.

233
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:24,613
Don't worry about it.

234
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,455
l've got the captain wrapped
around my finger.

235
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:34,896
Excuse me, l'm coming in!

236
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:39,827
Hi, l'm here to enlist new recruits
for the semester!

237
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,865
We're really not....

238
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:48,911
We both haven't really decided.

239
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:01,420
You can't even handle
being a recruiting officer!

240
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:05,057
Uh, l'm really sorry!

241
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:10,060
Our squad has to cheer as a united team.

242
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:13,670
Unity is the most important thing here.

243
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:17,173
For you to join the squad...

244
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:20,545
Wow!

245
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:26,381
l need to get to know you both very well.

246
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:31,689
l...l'm going to join!

247
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:32,913
Me too!

248
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:35,850
Great, let's start!

249
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:43,191
<i>I think I'm starting to</i>
<i>get the hang of being a captain.</i>

250
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:45,901
<i>I think this works best for me.</i>

251
00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:49,099
<i>It's important to know</i>
<i>my squad members well.</i>

252
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:53,671
<i>I think it only helps me</i>
<i>become a better captain!</i>
