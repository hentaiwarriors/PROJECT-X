1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,450
Almost...

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,780
two months...

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,810
already.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,450
I don't think...

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,950
I can...

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,440
make it...

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,750
anymore.

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,420
Strange...

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,330
no guards posted tonight.

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,400
I don't think...

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,260
I can escape...

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,230
anyway.

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,560
I didn't think you would be
the one to save me.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,760
But is it all right?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,830
Shouldn't we be on the run?

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,320
I'm sorry...

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,260
you've been...

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,360
treated very badly.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,500
That's all right.

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,100
Just answer my question.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,010
You should clean up first.

22
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,170
What do you mean?

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,250
This coming ceremony
is a very sacred event.

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,710
Everyone else except the head
priestess and her priestess...

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,980
is not allowed to stay in the castle.

26
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,460
That explains the absence of the guards.

27
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,290
This is the last stage here.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,030
Main characters are limited in any play.

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,870
Who?

30
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,240
I might only have a small role
if everyone forgets me so easily!

31
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,780
Ms. Eriko?

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,980
Who.

33
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,410
Is somebody here?

34
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,380
That can't be.

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,550
Mama said we were the only ones
in the castle.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,690
I thought there wasn't anybody here...

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,330
except for the two priestesses.

38
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,260
That must be the priestess.

39
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,240
Where's my underwear?

40
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,300
There!

41
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,580
Hiya!

42
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,600
You must be punished for your trespass.

43
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,440
Who are you?

44
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,210
Takuya?

45
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,050
Yu-No Episode 4

46
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,700
I'm sorry mama.

47
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,630
No, as long as you're all right.

48
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,480
But, I let all of them go!

49
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,680
Don't worry, just worry about
the upcoming ceremony.

50
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,820
Yes, mama.

51
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,040
That's really strange.

52
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,180
This area is protected by magic...

53
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,520
they shouldn't be able to move
freely around the castle.

54
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,500
It can't be him.

55
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,300
Who can he be?

56
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,740
Here, at Della Grand...

57
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,540
everything is considered very sacred...

58
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,150
and decisions made by the high priestess
is considered the word of god.

59
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,360
This is actually the real answer.

60
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,750
Everything in this world is...

61
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,800
controlled by this computer
network right here.

62
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,630
This place is like a diorama large scale.

63
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,530
I understand that.

64
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,170
But can somebody get me down?

65
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,810
I told you to just wear only your underwear.

66
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,320
Here, those with too much desire
will be restrained by it.

67
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,090
Your physical body is the only thing
that's really free.

68
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,030
Then you shouldn't be able
to wear underwear!

69
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,540
That's something I brought.

70
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
That's not of this world.

71
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,240
A bra?

72
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,270
Don't have one.

73
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,830
Takuya said it's not a good idea
to restrain breasts.

74
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,970
Wait, where did he go?

75
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,780
He wants to be alone now.

76
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:10,920
What?

77
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,950
He needs to concentrate his energy
on facing his fate.

78
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,980
You are so obsessed with the idea of fate.

79
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,730
I think it's comforting.

80
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,360
There's something of a bond
with the idea of fate.

81
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,400
Like you're not alone.

82
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,940
Stop that!

83
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,540
I think you will understand someday.

84
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,650
My life is in your hands, after all!

85
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,480
What's wrong?

86
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,760
I told you.

87
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,390
Here, those with too much desire...

88
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,260
are restrained by it in some way.

89
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,190
It's not much, but...

90
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm a related to the priestess in this world.

91
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:24,920
Papa!

92
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,560
No, stop that!

93
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,070
Stop, help me!

94
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,500
No!

95
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,610
Stop, don't!

96
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,050
Papa, Papa!

97
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,380
No!

98
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,970
We'll see each other again.

99
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,010
Must get revenge.

100
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,450
Very soon...

101
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,480
we will meet again!

102
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,620
Kaytia!

103
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,990
I think I'm all right.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,630
Don't worry about me.

105
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm glad.

106
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,740
A coin from this world.

107
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,310
When I was a little girl...

108
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,740
I found the same exact coin.

109
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,120
I don't know where I got it.

110
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,050
I carried it as a lucky charm.

111
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,220
I lost it when I dropped it in a well
in my back yard.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,760
It's a bond with this world.

113
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,260
A bond?

114
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,500
Then you've come here
for a very good reason.

115
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,700
Takuya.

116
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,880
Wait!

117
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,980
I have to go!

118
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,110
It's a bad idea.

119
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,750
He's not himself right now.

120
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,090
You'll see him soon enough.

121
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,650
I need to see him now!

122
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,090
I have so much I have to say!

123
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,900
You're going to be one with Grandia.

124
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,400
Just concentrate on that.

125
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,300
I know, that's why I was born,
and it's my fate!

126
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,840
I was born so I could save the world!

127
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,910
Him!

128
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,620
Why can't I stop thinking about him?

129
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,090
Watch out!

130
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,900
You are...

131
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,400
here again!

132
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,400
Takuya. Really.

133
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,780
Takuya.

134
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,450
Right?

135
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,410
Mama!

136
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,550
You've finally come here!

137
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:44,890
But how?

138
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,450
It can't be.

139
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,150
Ayumi.

140
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,460
You're late!

141
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,740
I was waiting a long time for you.

142
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,970
Mama, you know this man?

143
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,170
Who is he?

144
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,910
Sorry to interrupt this reunion.

145
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,080
Leave, I know you have
other things to do.

146
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,240
I don't need you to tell me.

147
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,190
Mama, tell me who he is!

148
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,620
His identity is not important
to you right now.

149
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,490
Now, come with me!

150
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,030
Yes, I know.

151
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,530
Wait!

152
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,800
Go, out of my way!

153
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,930
I'm your only opponent right now, Takuya.

154
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,570
So, you don't remember me anymore, I see.

155
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,320
You're Toyotomi!

156
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,450
I'll tell you something interesting.

157
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,650
You know Selles?

158
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,090
She's my sister.

159
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,530
Takuya!

160
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,990
We're not related by blood!

161
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,030
We were both orphans back then.

162
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,740
A priestess named Kaytia adopted us.

163
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,400
We were brought up as a family.

164
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,280
Stop it!

165
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,410
Mi yo?

166
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,680
Get out of my way!

167
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,430
The idea of a priestess saving the world
is just a fable!

168
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,030
You don't have to sacrifice yourself!

169
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,530
We'll meet again.

170
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,770
We have a special bond
between us called family.

171
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,480
But I don't want you to go!

172
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,840
You're all I have in the world!

173
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,980
Kaytia!

174
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,550
I wanted to see her again.

175
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,460
So I wandered all over the world.

176
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,330
Even wandered different dimensions, but...

177
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,190
When I finally found her at last,
she was already dead...

178
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,040
She died, to give birth to you!

179
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,970
Do you see?

180
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,600
Keiko Arima!

181
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,940
Your dead mother is Kaytia, my mother!

182
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,880
You aren't here at random,
you're here because of a connection.

183
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,550
You have had everything
I ever wanted out of life!

184
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,830
A mother's love.

185
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,460
A mother's warmth!

186
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,160
And my mother's blood!

187
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,130
Please, stop now!

188
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,390
I have reason to hate you!

189
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,040
I have every reason to take
everything you have!

190
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,280
Give No back!

191
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,160
Kaytia's blood!

192
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,260
I have it! I finally have it!

193
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,160
More, I want more!

194
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,300
I want to feel her presence!

195
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,140
More!

196
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,780
I'm coming to see you Kaytia...

197
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,150
right now...

198
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,930
The head priestess.

199
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,910
Can you feel Grandia?

200
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,820
I think I'm almost there!

201
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,060
We need to hurry, we don't have time!

202
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,590
We have to finish this very soon!

203
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,200
Takuya?

204
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,900
Stop Ayumi!

205
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,710
Please explain what's going on here!

206
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,410
Tell me where Yu-No is, first!

207
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,840
I know you know.

208
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,610
<i>How does he know about me?</i>

209
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,280
She isn't...

210
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,050
She's no longer your daughter.

211
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,990
Not anymore.

212
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,320
You're too late, you see.

213
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,730
You didn't arrive here until too late.

214
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,920
Just answer me!

215
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,560
Where the hell is Yu-No?

216
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,320
Don't hurt my mother!

217
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,290
Get out of the way!

218
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,400
Wait!

219
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,040
Takuya, that girl in front of you is Yu-No!

220
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,840
Are you...

221
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,620
really...

222
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,190
Yu-No?

223
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,490
Who are you?

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,400
I don't know who you are at all.

225
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,340
Yu-No!

226
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,840
I really don't know!

227
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,410
Takuya!

228
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,080
Takuya, are you okay.

229
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,580
This man is your father.

230
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,650
My father?

231
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,980
Papa?

232
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,390
This...

233
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,460
could be!

234
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,030
This event trigger something?

235
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,940
We must continue the ceremony!

236
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,270
Grandia!

237
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,140
But...

238
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,140
Hurry, now!

239
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,310
Right now, you have to stay
by your father's side!

240
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,110
You said you loved him more
than anybody else!

241
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,850
You have to hurry, No!

242
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,720
The fate of the world is in your hands.

243
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,090
Yes, I have to go.

244
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,060
Stop, wait a minute!

245
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,360
Just leave us alone!

246
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,740
Canna!

247
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,710
You can't leave us, Canna!

248
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,550
It's okay.

249
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,220
It's my fate, you see!

250
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,290
Just stop it with this fate thing!

251
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,160
I'll see you again!

252
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm sure of it!

253
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,630
I'm sure we're bound together by fate!

254
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,040
No, Canna!

255
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,570
Canna!

256
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,810
Hurry, No, now!

257
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,640
Can't you see!

258
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,010
Evoking Grandia's presence
won't change anything.

259
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,880
And how do you know this?

260
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,590
Grandia, the creator
of this planet, Della Grand.

261
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,650
The tragic fate of this world is part
of her ultimate plan.

262
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,490
But that can't be!

263
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,130
The fate you are facing
is not from natural causes.

264
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,330
Let go!

265
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,840
Hurry, you need to be by your father's side!

266
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,410
No, I was born to save this world!

267
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,550
Please, listen!

268
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,280
Unfortunately, I know that
he wasn't looking for me!

269
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,250
What?

270
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,360
You're the only one that can save him!

271
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,930
Please!

272
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,700
See, there!

273
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,510
A strange scientist just moved
into that house.

274
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,300
It's really weird.

275
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,880
As soon as he saw my face...

276
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,840
he said "I wasn't from this world"
like he's some kind of psychic.

277
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,180
But, I saw his wife,
and she's really beautiful!

278
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,520
They said their expecting their baby soon.

279
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,500
What was my father like?

280
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,130
I want to know just a little bit.

281
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,700
Tell me please!

282
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,070
Why didn't Canna.

283
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,630
Why didn't she tell me anything about this?

284
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,540
I'm waiting.

285
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,580
Mom in the future.

286
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,240
I promise to be a good mother.

287
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,260
I'll raise you right!

288
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,230
No.

289
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,330
You are Takuya.

290
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,330
I'm papa.

291
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,830
Papa?

292
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,110
Here!

293
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,440
A lucky charm.

294
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,610
For when we meet once again.

295
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,090
Selles!

296
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,860
Yes, I understand!

297
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,510
Grandia's leaving now!

298
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,230
Ayumi.

299
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,840
She might be the biggest victim
out of anybody here.

300
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,490
Ayumi.

301
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,230
No, this can't be!

302
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,970
Things weren't supposed to go
like this at all!

303
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,470
I was going to be able
to fix everything!

304
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,440
It's okay.

305
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,340
It's really okay now.

306
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,180
I'm the one at fault here.

307
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,420
I was just looking out for me.

308
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,620
Instead of those important to me.

309
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,220
I didn't mean to leave you.

310
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,690
Takuya, don't!

311
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,460
Run, Ayumi!

312
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,470
Wait, Takuya!

313
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,960
I waited!

314
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,370
I waited!

315
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,510
Takuya!

316
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,280
Takuya!

317
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,150
You're going?

318
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,690
It's my fate.

319
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,260
It's all right.

320
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,960
I'm sorry.

321
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,910
I held you responsible for so much!

322
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,130
What you do now will not
change the fate of this world...

323
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,180
or anything else.

324
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,270
Grandia...

325
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,380
she's calling me...

326
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,470
to her.

327
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,780
Besides.

328
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,560
You remember now?

329
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,290
That's impossible, she can't bring back
any of her memories.

330
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,100
In order to be a priestess,
you have to forget everything.

331
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,600
I promised already.

332
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,630
I really can't remember who he is.

333
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,370
I have to go.

334
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,370
I don't want regrets.

335
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,340
No!

336
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,440
I hear her.

337
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,160
I hear Grandia's voice,
she's calling me!

338
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,460
Please take responsibility.

339
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,770
Hi Mitsuki!

340
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,140
I thought you'd be here.

341
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,920
This is my favorite, special spot!

342
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,790
How about here?

343
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,860
It's reserved just for you.

344
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,600
I'm late!

345
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,710
I'll help you out, then!

346
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,040
Wait, that's my food!

347
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,110
Have fun!

348
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,960
Did you sleep?

349
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,120
Let's leave for school.

350
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,390
You're sure?

351
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,430
Of course.

352
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,200
Hey, Miyo!

353
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,140
Is there somebody in there with you?

354
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,370
No, you have to go!

355
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,740
But how do I get out of here?

356
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,410
Hurry, out the window!

357
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,780
This is the 2nd floor!

358
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,090
I'll introduce you to my dad soon.

359
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,260
He said we'll meet again!

360
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,360
Maybe this charm didn't work.

361
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,730
I can't stay in this world.

362
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,540
How are you?

363
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,700
You are...

364
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,840
Sorry I'm late!

365
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,420
Can I ask a question?

366
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,490
Sure.

367
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,720
I tried hard, but I really can't
remember who you are.

368
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,450
Do I have to be your daughter?

369
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,130
I think...

370
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,930
I'm falling in love with you.

371
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,710
Can... I... Can I love you as a woman
and not a daughter?

372
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,810
With mom's blessing.

373
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,400
I never used to like predictable
happy endings.

374
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,770
But this is all right.

375
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,870
I hope to see them again.

376
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,750
No, I'm sure I will.
