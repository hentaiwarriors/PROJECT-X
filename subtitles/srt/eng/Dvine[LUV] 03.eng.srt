1
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:12,417
Please, no more.

2
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:17,531
Help!

3
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:42,781
No more.

4
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,225
No!

5
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,507
Miss Mia!

6
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,952
Miss Mia.

7
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,962
Help me.

8
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:26,424
Miss Mia.

9
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:39,109
You're right. Even Dr. Shizki
cannot cure some diseases.

10
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:43,917
You're talking about the Suhyle lady.

11
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,447
I've heard she's suffering
from a serious disease.

12
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:50,356
I've heard she's suffering
from a serious disease.

13
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:53,951
They decided to use a very
dangerous medicine.

14
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:56,156
And then what happened?

15
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:59,326
The medicine worked all right,
so she is cured of the disease.

16
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:02,371
She is cured, but it had
a strange side effect.

17
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,038
Sakra side effect?

18
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:07,440
Yes.

19
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:09,511
What kind?

20
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:13,446
Well, that is...

21
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,712
She's become a slut.

22
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,214
Sakra, a what?

23
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,915
Is there a medicine like that?

24
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:26,587
I've heard about it!
Elixir, the legendary secret medicine.

25
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:29,591
I really don't know the details.

26
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:33,327
A few days ago, Priol, who works
at the Suhyle Mansion came by...

27
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,669
and I just overheard when she
was consulting Dr. Shizki.

28
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,872
Hyde.

29
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,533
Dr. Shizki.

30
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,402
Are you making progress in searching
through the Cave?

31
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,382
Well, I've been quite busy
with this and that recently.

32
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:52,416
Who knows what keeps you busy.

33
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:13,907
I see. So she took the Elixir.

34
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:15,808
Yes.

35
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,537
She's suffering every night ever since.

36
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:20,340
No wonder.

37
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,583
What can we do?

38
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,515
- Give her a man.
- What? A man?

39
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:30,257
Once she experiences a man,
the side effect will cease.

40
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:32,727
That's what I hear.

41
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:34,857
No way.

42
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,583
If the old man Folkiss finds me
here at this hour...

43
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:33,144
- I won't be able to get away alive.
- Don't worry.

44
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:36,123
The master has business
in the town of DayVeen.

45
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,183
He won't be coming back tonight.

46
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:43,756
Right here, in this mansion,
there are only you, me and Miss Mia.

47
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,430
And, what's up?

48
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:49,830
Is it about that medicine?

49
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:51,237
Yes.

50
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:55,841
Just the other day, Miss Mia's condition
got worse all of sudden.

51
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:58,207
She took that medicine.

52
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,641
So she finally took it.

53
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:03,610
It worked very well.

54
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:06,314
It was you who saved Miss Mia's life.

55
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:09,656
We all thank you very much for that.

56
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:13,421
Miss Mia, the Master,
and even I thank you for that.

57
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:17,730
I couldn't do anything to help her.

58
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,566
That's not true.
It was only because of your last...

59
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,838
act of dedication that I got it.

60
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,305
Silly.

61
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:28,106
To be honest with you...

62
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:32,938
I wouldn't ask you to do
something like this.

63
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:37,309
Something like what?

64
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,200
Hey.

65
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:00,139
Mr. Hyde, I didn't know you were here.

66
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:02,334
How are you feeling?

67
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:04,307
Well.

68
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:07,641
I seem to have been cured
of the disease itself.

69
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:10,515
Thank you very much for the medicine.

70
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,186
I'm so glad that medicine worked so well.
I would like to say so.

71
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,718
Priol called for me today.

72
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,489
She told me about the side effect.

73
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:26,359
I asked her to ask you to come over.

74
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:28,770
I know I'm causing trouble
asking you something...

75
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:30,829
like this all of the sudden.

76
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,747
Mia. Let me.

77
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:44,175
Yes. I like you, Mr. Hyde.

78
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,584
I like you, too, Mia.

79
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:03,937
Should anything happen to Miss Mia...

80
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,673
I won't let him get away.

81
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,380
I'm the same age as Priol...

82
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:16,584
but my breasts are not as big as hers.

83
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:18,643
I like you just the way you are.

84
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,124
You're very pretty.

85
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,786
You mean it?

86
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:47,579
Come on, don't try to slip away.

87
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:49,617
But...

88
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:50,841
No!

89
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:05,727
Come on, let go.

90
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,063
Okay.

91
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,614
No!

92
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:29,683
I have to get you really ready.

93
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:32,861
But maybe this is the side
effect of that medicine.

94
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:34,896
You're so very wet.

95
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,066
That bastard.

96
00:09:28,717 --> 00:09:30,446
Are you ready?

97
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:34,317
Yes.

98
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,960
I feel...

99
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:08,145
I'm putting it in.

100
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:09,321
Yes.

101
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,322
Hot! Your cock is hot!

102
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,890
Doesn't it hurt?

103
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:19,733
No.

104
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,328
Mia. We're one now.

105
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:27,600
Look.

106
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:31,477
Now, I'm moving a little.

107
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:32,807
Yes.

108
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:45,154
Mr. Hyde.

109
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,297
Mr. Hyde.

110
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:17,224
Mia, you're petite, so...

111
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:23,097
let's do it like this.

112
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:30,300
I don't have strength.

113
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,675
It's getting good for me, too.

114
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:27,392
Mr. Hyde.

115
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:30,025
Mr. Hyde.

116
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,385
I can't, anymore.

117
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,315
No more!

118
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,474
Mr. Hyde.

119
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:17,979
Mr. Hyde...

120
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,301
Mr. Hyde.

121
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:58,580
Hyde, wake up already!

122
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:22,239
Hyde, what were you
doing last night again?

123
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,942
My dear, Sakra...

124
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,045
It's all a misunderstanding, Sakra.

125
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,348
Let's put aside the question
of what I'm misunderstanding.

126
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:36,590
Eura is gone.

127
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,216
What?

128
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:42,258
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

129
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:46,198
It is not for you to apologize.

130
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:48,427
Teres is gone, too, which means...

131
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:51,069
They are both in the Cave.

132
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,501
I'm sorry.

133
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,007
Then I'd better get going.

134
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:00,979
Hyde.

135
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:02,208
What?

136
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:06,146
Tell me all about last night
when you get back.

137
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:10,281
See you later!

138
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:33,081
Somehow, all the monsters
are very rambunctious today.

139
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:48,552
Finally you are here.

140
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:08,815
Eura! Teres!

141
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,378
I'm tired of waiting for you.

142
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:16,021
Is it you? Do you have it?

143
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,852
What are you talking about?

144
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:21,521
The amulet. Give me the amulet.

145
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,533
I shall exchange it for the two girls.

146
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,672
I cannot do that.

147
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,065
The Stormbringer isn't it?

148
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,279
Hey, are you all right?

149
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,450
Yeah.

150
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,686
You want this?

151
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,922
I can smash this into pieces right now,
right here.

152
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:24,877
All right. I don't need this girl.

153
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:41,569
But I won't give you this doll
until I'm done with it.

154
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:44,002
Doll?

155
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:47,199
You're here and you don't even know that?

156
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,610
This is the very key to open the gate.

157
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:58,149
Once the gate is open...

158
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,617
I won't need it anymore.

159
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:03,117
So, give me the amulet!

160
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:40,754
Just watch.

161
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:14,953
Kill them.

162
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,634
Eura!

163
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:48,460
What?

164
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,659
What the heck?

165
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:09,509
Hyde, destroy that sphere!

166
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:35,300
Hey, are you alive?

167
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:41,074
What the hell was that?

168
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,512
It must have been a type of magic
organism created by the spirits.

169
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:01,257
Eura...

170
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:04,302
I am not human.

171
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,875
No, don't touch me!

172
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,876
Hyde, not you!

173
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:16,016
- Where's Teres?
- She's gone after Slain.

174
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:17,549
What?

175
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:19,620
Why don't you go after Teres?

176
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:23,982
Why me? She's one of your men, isn't she?

177
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,159
We had a little fall out. Besides,
I really don't know what to do with her.

178
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,288
What?

179
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:33,629
Don't worry. I'll take Eura
to that lady doctor.

180
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:38,570
You why do you know everything?

181
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:43,067
Who the hell are you?

182
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:46,007
If you don't hurry, Teres might die.

183
00:23:57,652 --> 00:23:59,142
Nice place, isn't it?

184
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:02,717
This is my hideaway,
rather, my supply base.

185
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,172
Why did you help me?

186
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,751
I came in here, ready to die.

187
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:45,690
But I even failed at that.

188
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,267
What are you talking about,
why do you have to die?

189
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,401
I took Eura with me, because...

190
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,803
I meant to use her as bait.

191
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,006
But that didn't work with Slain.

192
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,950
I can't even avenge my friends.
How could I?

193
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:08,820
If I live any longer,
I'd be just shaming myself.

194
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:13,190
That's not cute.

195
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:16,860
I can't depend on others.

196
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:21,233
If I depend on others,
I'll only get them involved.

197
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:25,838
I'll only get them killed.
I get everybody killed.

198
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:52,529
No more. I don't want it anymore.

199
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,760
I don't want to lose people
important to me anymore!

200
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,398
I don't want to suffer like that. I can't.

201
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,234
I don't need friends.

202
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:11,413
That's enough.

203
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:14,985
You're not alone. Not now.

204
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,485
Not anymore.

205
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,689
That bastard's thing,
that was following him...

206
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:23,492
around like a fish crap?

207
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,758
That magical organism?

208
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:27,828
I killed it.

209
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:33,536
Don't worry.
I can't get killed that easily.

210
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:39,036
Don't be nice to me.

211
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:45,347
Don't worry. I won't die.

212
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:54,124
Hyde.
