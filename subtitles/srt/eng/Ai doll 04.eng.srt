1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:04,267
<i>After my mother's death, I was</i>
<i>raised at a convent where I was</i>...

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:07,170
...<i>subjected to indescribable disgrace</i>.

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:11,038
<i>During that time my ray of hope was</i>...

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,547
...<i>the brief moments I spent with</i>
<i>Andrew, the Prince of this country</i>.

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,378
<i>Later my uncle, Duke Dusse,</i>
<i>took me into his care</i>.

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,079
<i>Under my uncle's orders I</i>
<i>started the harsh training</i>...

7
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:25,284
...<i>to become a Love Doll,</i>
<i>the flower of high society</i>.

8
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:29,626
<i>My uncle's gaze upon me</i>
<i>can be as cold as ice</i>.

9
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,021
<i>But at times, it can</i>
<i>be unbelievably tender</i>.

10
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,936
<i>Several months have passed since</i>
<i>I came to my uncle's manor but</i>...

11
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,563
...<i>I have yet to understand him</i>.

12
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:47,235
Love Doll Episode 4

13
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:24,212
Madame, the usual gentleman
is at the back door.

14
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,944
I see. Will you go get Marsha?

15
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,011
Her again!?

16
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,883
The gentleman requests
her so don't make a fuss.

17
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,430
Fine then.

18
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,625
Dear.

19
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,563
What a troublesome customer.

20
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:52,200
Mr. L, I have readied the usual girl.

21
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,802
Please, go upstairs.

22
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,783
Marsha, Mr. L is coming!
Get yourself ready!

23
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,757
I'm ready whenever.

24
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,129
Jeez!

25
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,590
Don't be such a bitch just because
you have a high paying client!

26
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,806
<i>People are attracted to others of</i>
<i>equal or higher stature, you know</i>.

27
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,269
<i>A client like him</i>
<i>will be of good use</i>.

28
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,181
<i>It's my chance to regain</i>
<i>my elite status</i>.

29
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,119
<i>I'll do anything for that!</i>

30
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,488
What would you like
to do today, Mr. L?

31
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,622
I had an acquaintance make
this. I want to test it out.

32
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,532
Oh what is that?

33
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,231
Get on the bed.

34
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,303
As you wish. Do
whatever pleases you.

35
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,722
It's amazing... that thing...

36
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:41,484
It's so good...
It's amazing, Mr. L.

37
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:49,555
Mr. L, I've been satisfied
more than enough.

38
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,821
It's your turn now.

39
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:03,903
Is your dick hard from
watching me get so hot?

40
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,648
It seems it's not hard yet.

41
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,708
Let me pleasure you with my mouth.

42
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,479
That's enough.

43
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,652
Do not worry. It's not because
you did anything wrong.

44
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,589
Will you come again?

45
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,330
Yes.

46
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,738
Mr. L, you're a great client.

47
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:46,217
But I've decided to exploit
your secret for better profits.

48
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,753
You hear?

49
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,324
Rachel.

50
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,897
The date for your debut as
a Love Doll has been set.

51
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:03,832
Yes.

52
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,000
It is a ball with the royal family,
appropriate for Lady Rachel.

53
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,970
I've heard that Prince Andrew
who has graduated from...

54
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,980
...the Royal University
will also be present.

55
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,011
I'm sure it will be
a glamorous ball.

56
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,147
<i>Andrew!?</i>

57
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,257
<i>Andrew will be</i>...

58
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,829
Lady Rachel...

59
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,273
...to fulfill your duty
as a Love Doll...

60
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,507
...I imagine that you will be bedded
with many different types of men.

61
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,716
Tonight's lesson is to
bear in mind...

62
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,217
...the man who will bed a woman
for the first time.

63
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,521
<i>I'll get to see Andrew soon</i>.

64
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,819
<i>I could bear anything in order to</i>...

65
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,729
I've been awaiting you, My Lady.

66
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:24,178
What's wrong? If you're so shy,
we won't be able to do anything.

67
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:26,950
S-sorry.

68
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:46,560
Can you take charge
from here, please?

69
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,939
Yes... you're doing great.

70
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,610
Okay.

71
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:11,357
It feels so good. It feels strange
down there. Like it's aching.

72
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,593
Please, don't stare.

73
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,560
It's embarrassing.

74
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,820
I'm sorry.

75
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,092
It's okay.

76
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,323
You're still hard.

77
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,837
It feels like you
can keep going.

78
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:30,832
If we stop here it would be
somewhat unsatisfying, wouldn't it?

79
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:48,860
If feels wonderful.
You're doing great.

80
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,124
<i>Andrew</i>.

81
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:01,105
<i>When I think about seeing you soon,</i>
<i>I can endure any kind of hardship</i>.

82
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:08,311
<i>It's a lesson and I'm having sex</i>
<i>with a man I don't even know but</i>...

83
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,846
...<i>If I think you</i>...

84
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,249
<i>Rachel</i>...

85
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,946
<i>I love you</i>.

86
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,010
Huh?

87
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,248
<i>Andrew!?</i>

88
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,664
Please, don't stop. I want
you to hurry and cum.

89
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,929
Okay.

90
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,246
<i>Oh Andrew</i>.

91
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,638
Excuse me, miss! What do
you think you're doing!?

92
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,842
I don't know how much you
spent to bribe the Madame but...

93
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,970
...it's quite bothersome if
you're going to work here!

94
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,211
Do you understand?

95
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,978
This place isn't for you!

96
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:20,777
You hear!?

97
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,378
Today will be the last
time you come here!

98
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,624
<i>Rachel!?</i>

99
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,154
<i>Marsha!?</i>

100
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,472
I heard about your house.

101
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,840
How unfortunate.

102
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:51,175
You say that but you're probably
thinking I deserved it, aren't you?

103
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,810
After all, your bully's
house went bankrupt.

104
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,478
Of course not!

105
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,749
I was really worried.

106
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,050
Well it doesn't matter, whichever way.

107
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:07,791
I was getting bored of living
in high society anyway.

108
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,231
Marsha.

109
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,497
In any event...

110
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,439
...why are you roaming around here?

111
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,377
I thought your rich uncle was taking
care of you? It's really strange.

112
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,839
Th-that's...

113
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,351
No difference between the rich and
the poor in shady business, I guess.

114
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,057
Oh yes!

115
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:36,424
My frequent client seems to be
a nobleman of high status but...

116
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,827
...his dick is useless.

117
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,291
I heard it's because of an injury
he sustained in the battlefield.

118
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,929
He may be a noble,
but that's pathetic.

119
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,601
I wonder if you're one of
those pathetic nobles too?

120
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,871
I'm trying to find out some
stuff about this man.

121
00:11:55,948 --> 00:12:01,147
He wears a mask to hide his face
but I don't think that's all he's hiding.

122
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,117
He probably lost his right eye.

123
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,589
His right eye?

124
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,561
Isn't that a great mark?

125
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,825
Do you know of any nobles like that?

126
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:17,395
If you know something,
tell me. We're old friends.

127
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,006
It would be good of you to tell
me if you know something.

128
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,167
Seems like you're going
through tough times too.

129
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,776
<i>He probably lost his right eye</i>.

130
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,183
<i>Uncle?</i>

131
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,680
Rachel, do you...?

132
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,849
I'm sorry. I...

133
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,586
...have a carriage waiting, so I must go.

134
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,688
I'm glad I saw you. I won't
come here anymore.

135
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,060
I promise.

136
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,874
<i>Uncle is</i>...

137
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,019
...<i>impotent?</i>

138
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,623
<i>Could it be?</i>...

139
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,932
Miss.

140
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,736
Sorry to keep you waiting.

141
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,676
The head editor is in the
carriage on top of this bridge.

142
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,339
I see. Thank you.

143
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,904
Hold on a sec!

144
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,081
I don't know why you
asked me to steal...

145
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,916
...the Aristocratic Registry List
from the newspaper company...

146
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,718
...but you've put me
in a real tight spot.

147
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:52,865
So if the information you're about to
give the editor is some stupid lead...

148
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:57,165
Rest assured. Your
efforts will be rewarded.

149
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,869
I'll be counting on it.

150
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,907
Sure.

151
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,615
It's interesting
information but...

152
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,818
...without any proof, you
can't expect me to buy it.

153
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,427
I understand.

154
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:25,056
He's supposed to come
tomorrow night at eleven o'clock.

155
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,564
Take your pictures or
whatever you need then.

156
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,397
Sounds fine. That'll
be the plan then.

157
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,029
I'll pay you afterwards.

158
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:33,935
Okay.

159
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:39,939
Anyway, is it true that a girl named
Rachel is at that Duke Dusse's place?

160
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,913
That's certain, but why do you ask?

161
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,576
Oh no reason.

162
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,978
<i>Poor Rachel</i>.

163
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:54,381
<i>Your uncle is about to be ruined</i>
<i>and everything will fall apart</i>.

164
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,428
<i>All because of me</i>.

165
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:02,262
<i>You'll be out on the</i>
<i>streets, in the filthy world</i>.

166
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,735
<i>And I will make my return to</i>
<i>the glorious world of the elite</i>.

167
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,944
Lady Rachel.

168
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,785
I have made the arrangements
about the whore.

169
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,419
Are you sure about this?

170
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,455
Yes.

171
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,858
Please go ahead.

172
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,128
Yes, my Lady.

173
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,291
<i>Marsha</i>.

174
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,131
<i>Forgive me</i>.

175
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,297
<i>Everything is for my uncle</i>.

176
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,939
<i>For my uncle</i>...

177
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,364
Rachel.

178
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:16,700
Yes.

179
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,208
I need to talk to you.

180
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,310
Have you discovered...

181
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,183
...my secret?

182
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,488
Secret? W-what are
you talking about?

183
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,692
There's no need to hide it. What
the slut was saying is true.

184
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,900
That's all. Return
to your lessons.

185
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,597
Uncle.

186
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,661
What?

187
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,106
The story that you sustained
an injury in battle must be a lie.

188
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,042
If it was a physical injury...

189
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:58,243
...you can't expect it to heal
by going to a place like that.

190
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:03,721
Did you have some sort of mental
shock or did something else happen?

191
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,953
It did, didn't it?
Is that it, Uncle!?

192
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,460
Leave.

193
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,655
Uncle!!

194
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,232
Just get out!!

195
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:21,732
I don't understand. I don't
understand what you're thinking.

196
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,110
Uncle...

197
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,913
...you're the only relative
I have left in this world.

198
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,352
Please tell me, Uncle.

199
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,184
I...

200
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,020
I'm not afraid to know
what happened to you!

201
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,429
After going through the
lessons of a Love Doll...

202
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,798
...I've nothing left to fear!

203
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:46,856
No!

204
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:47,694
Get out!!

205
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,736
Why? Do you hate me, uncle?

206
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,105
That's not it.

207
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,133
Then why?

208
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,904
It's because...

209
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,468
It's because you resemble
my sister too much!!

210
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,575
My mother!?

211
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,783
I was in love with
my own sister.

212
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,222
I was in love with your mother!!

213
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:26,536
My sister was the most
important part of my existence.

214
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:35,780
But the day came when
my sister was to marry.

215
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:48,320
In despair, to distract my mind, I
was intimate with countless women.

216
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:54,422
But that was only an empty act.

217
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:02,566
To find a new meaning for my
life, I left for the battlefield.

218
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,485
I learned of my sister's death in a
letter delivered on the battlefield.

219
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,357
Since then, I haven't been
able to get an erection.

220
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,665
Poor uncle.

221
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,159
I'm such a fool.

222
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,672
Of all sins, I was in
love with my own sister!!

223
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,473
W-what are you doing!?

224
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:51,220
I was able to train as a Love
Doll thanks to you, uncle.

225
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:56,125
If I can help with the things I've
learned, I'll gladly do anything!

226
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,898
Uncle, please let me help you!

227
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,292
I swear I'll cure you!

228
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,630
I swear.

229
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,433
No!!

230
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,334
How can I be forgiven...

231
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,678
...for having sex with my niece
who's the very image of my sister!

232
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,747
But... Why uncle?

233
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:24,255
I just want to help you.

234
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,252
Uncle!

235
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,527
Uncle!!

236
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,110
Mother!?

237
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,445
Please, explain. Why is...?

238
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,655
After my sister's death...

239
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,661
I claimed her body and secretly
moved her to this room.

240
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:42,692
I had her body completely preserved
and gave her eternal beauty.

241
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,901
Rachel.

242
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,731
Forgive me.

243
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,237
Uncle.

244
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:58,979
As my only relative, you should
be living your life as an aristocrat.

245
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,179
But I have forced you take
the path of a Love Doll...

246
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,348
...knowing it to be one of
the hardest ways of life.

247
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,086
It was because you looked
exactly like my sister.

248
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,659
The strict training as a Love Doll...

249
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:16,131
...was meant to make
you into my ideal woman.

250
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:21,229
It was the method I chose to make
you into a reincarnation of my sister.

251
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,466
Uncle.

252
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,105
Forgive me.

253
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,502
There's nothing to forgive.

254
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:35,516
I'm overjoyed to find out that your
love for my mother was so deep.

255
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,355
You lost the drive to have sex...

256
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,791
...because of your grief over
the loss of your beloved.

257
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,255
You have such a tender heart.

258
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,191
Rachel.

259
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,734
Dusse.

260
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,578
I am not dead...

261
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:04,775
Come... If you love me from
the bottom of your heart...

262
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,317
...be strong and embrace me.

263
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,481
Sister...

264
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:26,398
<i>For uncle, my mother holds the</i>
<i>same place as Andrew does for me</i>.

265
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,869
Uncle!!

266
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,235
It feels so good.

267
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,461
It's wonderful.
It's so good, uncle.

268
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,637
Uncle.

269
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,439
What is it?

270
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,675
You're fingers are great but...

271
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,477
...I want your...

272
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,541
But I...

273
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,155
Don't worry, uncle.

274
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:20,417
Look. It's really hard now uncle.

275
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,752
Uncle, please come in me.

276
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:44,234
It's in me. Your dick is inside me.

277
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,744
Rachel.

278
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,183
Rachel.

279
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,854
It's amazing! The inside
of my body is getting hot!

280
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,493
It's so wonderfully
numbing... My pussy is...

281
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,965
Uncle.

282
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,342
Rachel... I'm going to...

283
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:25,005
Oh uncle... Hurry... Hurry...

284
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:47,702
Uncle.

285
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,664
Uncle.

286
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,981
Uncle.

287
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:23,924
Tonight I will make my debut as a Love Doll.

288
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,789
I have endured such harsh
training to reach this day.

289
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:42,508
I am sure my mother and
uncle are watching over me.

290
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,596
No!
