1
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,600
This place is huge.

2
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,450
Please keep an eye out for your
children to avoid any injuries.

3
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,180
I can't wait!

4
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,180
We will now lower the safety bar, be careful.

5
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,740
Please enjoy the show.

6
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,480
It's been days since Kagano said her goodbye.

7
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,550
There hasn't been any rapes since then.

8
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,530
And everyone forgot about her existence...

9
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,660
I thought I would never see her again.

10
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,370
I also felt that something of me was missing...

11
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,970
See, he's right here!

12
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,480
We were looking for you!

13
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,210
What are you doing, Onii-chan?

14
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,950
Here, I bought you lunch.

15
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,520
Let's eat together.

16
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,060
Onii-chan, here. Fried noodle bread and milk.

17
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,560
Thanks.

18
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,290
Huh, where is Chie-chan?

19
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,290
Chie got the cold since yesterday.

20
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,330
I see, too bad.

21
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, she sounded sick on the phone.

22
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,110
Let's go visit her.

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,870
Yeah, but Chie's mom said
we should leave her alone.

24
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,050
I see.

25
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:13,150
Onii-chan, today is minimum day so
let's all go out somewhere after school.

26
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,620
OK, Miahiro-senpai?

27
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,660
Akitoshi, I want to ask you something later.

28
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,600
Kagano!?

29
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,430
Hey, Onii-chan!

30
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,640
Okajima-kun?

31
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,770
Kagano!

32
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,810
Uh... wrong person...

33
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,050
What's this!?

34
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,190
I'm so happy you asked me out!

35
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,100
That voice, is it Chie-chan?

36
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,300
What did you want to talk about?

37
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,500
What is this!?

38
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,870
What's wrong!?

39
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,600
No, no, something is crawling up!

40
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,670
No, it's so sick!

41
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,870
It's coming inside my panties!

42
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,310
Chie-chan, what's wrong!?

43
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,520
No, don't come. Please stop!

44
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,290
What's going on!?

45
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,890
Chie, Chie-chan!

46
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,050
What is this!? What's going on!

47
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,560
It hasn't finished yet...

48
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,990
Hasn't finished?

49
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,040
Kagano?

50
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,070
Yes...

51
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,940
It hasn't finished... beware of the ones dear to you.

52
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,670
Okajima-kun?

53
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,940
Okajima-kun?

54
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,100
Onii-chan?

55
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,240
Akitoshi!

56
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,980
Kagano...

57
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,950
Okajima-kun, are you ok?

58
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,750
Onii-chan, what just happened?

59
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,650
Miahiro and Touru?

60
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,530
Chie-chan! Is Chie-chan alright!?

61
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,160
What are you saying, I told you
she's been sick since yesterday.

62
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,100
What...?

63
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,990
Don't you remember Yua-chan said she has a cold?

64
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,090
What's wrong, Akitoshi?

65
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,670
Onii-chan, what's wrong?

66
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
Oh, food!

67
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,240
Was that Kagano?

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,970
No, something was different.

69
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,380
Akitoshi, Akitoshi!

70
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,410
About that question, may I please ask Yua-chan...

71
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,520
out on a date?

72
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,150
Hmm, yeah...

73
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,390
She said it wasn't finished yet...

74
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,690
Is it about the rapes?

75
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,560
More monsters!?

76
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,030
...beware of the ones dear to you.

77
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,600
So it's OK with you if I ask Yua-chan?

78
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,340
Uh... yeah...

79
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,840
Yes, alright!

80
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,140
Not... finished?

81
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,350
Coming.

82
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,420
Hello, Okajima residence.

83
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,990
Akitoshi-chan, dinner is ready.

84
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,080
Please tell Yua to come home.

85
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,680
Huh, Yua?

86
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,330
Oh, Yua isn't there?

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,370
It's 8 o'clock, where could she be?

88
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,230
Did she tell you anything?

89
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,670
Out on a date?

90
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll go look for her.

91
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,140
Oh, thank you.

92
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,650
Wassup Akitoshi?

93
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,280
Touru, you know where Yua is?

94
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,350
Oh, Yua-chan and I separated at the park.

95
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,450
The park?

96
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,390
Hey, you said I can ask her out on a date.

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,930
Oh yeah... but where is Yua?

98
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,630
She said she forgot something
inside the park and went back inside.

99
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,930
Yua isn't back yet?

100
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,070
Yeah, not yet.

101
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,940
Want to go look for her at the park?

102
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,800
Yeah!

103
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,310
Alright, I'll wait for you at the park entrance.

104
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,960
I overslept! Where is this?

105
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,670
This is the park...

106
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,680
Chie, don't scare me!

107
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,850
What are you doing here, Yua?

108
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,740
Huh, didn't you have a cold, Chie?

109
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,480
I do, but I was worried about
you so I came looking for you.

110
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,260
Really? But what about you?

111
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,830
Anything for Yua.

112
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,630
Yua, I always thought you were so cute!

113
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,830
Chie, you're acting weird.

114
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,940
Chie, you're scaring me.

115
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,640
I love you.

116
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,010
Yua...

117
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,880
Crap!

118
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,550
What is Yua doing!

119
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,900
Akitoshi, over here!

120
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,840
No, Chie, what's wrong!?

121
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,420
Don't run, Yua.

122
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,750
Chie, what happened, what's going on!

123
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,290
I'll be gentle...

124
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,280
Yua...

125
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,530
Chie is a monster!

126
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,190
Yua...

127
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,070
So cute...

128
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,000
My first kiss... taken by Chie.

129
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,140
So happy...

130
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,010
No!

131
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,250
Wait up, Yua.

132
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,920
So mean, thought we are friends.

133
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,160
No, stop it!

134
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,130
No, no, Chie stop!

135
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,760
Not like this, no!

136
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,100
Quiet down, Yua.

137
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,170
Good girl.

138
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,600
Looks delicious.

139
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,300
Cute breast.

140
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,310
No Chie, stop!

141
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,910
Yua, so cute.

142
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:20,940
Chi...!

143
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,890
No!!

144
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,260
No, No! Chie, let go!

145
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,130
I loved you since we met.

146
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,690
I want to have you every way possible!

147
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,870
Not there!

148
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,740
No, not the butt!!

149
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,710
Touru, you sure she's here?

150
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,330
It's locked.

151
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,770
I'll go from behind, you stay here.

152
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,600
Hey, Touru!

153
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,350
Is someone there!

154
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,650
Who is it!!

155
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:53,770
Yua!

156
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,480
Hey, what are you doing!?

157
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,920
Oh, Okajima-senpai. You here to pick up Yua?

158
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,450
Too bad, she doesn't want to go home.

159
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,590
Onii-chan...

160
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,400
Yua!

161
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,830
Now it's Chie-chan? It didn't finish!?

162
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,460
Senpai, let's have fun together.

163
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,430
Onii-chan... come...

164
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,100
Yua, wake up!

165
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,300
Chie, realize what you're doing!

166
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,670
What? I can't hear you from over there.

167
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,910
Senpai, what is it?

168
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,680
Senpai, you love Yua too, right?

169
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,090
You can touch her breast
and lick her womanhood all you want.

170
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,320
Oh, you have never seen it before?

171
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,330
Here, let's show him closely.

172
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,300
So cute, look at him Yua. He's flushing red.

173
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,500
Onii-chan, look at me and make me feel good...

174
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,580
Stop it! Stop it, Yua!

175
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,310
You're so stubborn.

176
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,180
Yua, let's team up to make him feel better.

177
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,880
Huh?

178
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,260
Yua, stop it!

179
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,370
Stop it, Yua!

180
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,830
Senapi, you were quick.

181
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,540
Was Yua's mouth that great?

182
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,550
But it's only the beginning.

183
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,350
What are you...

184
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,880
But... there's one thing I want you to tell me.

185
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,790
Who is Kagano Ai?

186
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,780
Who is Kagano?

187
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,250
Oh, I think you know her very well.

188
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,430
No one named Ai is in my class.

189
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,060
I never said your class...

190
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,570
See, you know.

191
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,360
It's her, right?

192
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,410
Who is she... what is she to you?

193
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,680
I told you, I don't know!

194
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,420
I see... if you don't tell me, Yua will be...

195
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,420
Chie-chan, stop! What are you doing!?

196
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,930
If you don't tell me, Yua's pussy will get penetrated!

197
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,660
Stop! I really don't know!!

198
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,140
Senpai, Yua is still a clean virgin.

199
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,340
See, it's tight.

200
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,880
But, if you don't tell me...

201
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,110
Feel like talking?

202
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,810
Senpai?

203
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,450
Chie-chan, I beg you. Please stop!

204
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,390
No! It hurts!

205
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,900
Really, I really don't know anything!

206
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,370
Stop lying!

207
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,430
Onii-chan, it hurts!

208
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,410
She told me not to ask anything!

209
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,340
You think I will believe that?

210
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,010
Stop it, stop it!

211
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,320
It hurts, it hurts! Onii-chan!

212
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,780
Stop it, please stop it!

213
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,130
You are stubborn...

214
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,720
Yua, I'm sorry but blame your brother.

215
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,540
Yua, sorry... l'm sorry...

216
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,860
Who is it!

217
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,390
I'll tell you...

218
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,020
Right there!

219
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,110
I am Ai.

220
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,840
Kagano!

221
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,480
Ai...

222
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,180
No worries, I cut off the tentacles controlling her.

223
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,130
Ai...

224
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,830
Kagano, you came back!

225
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,670
I just have unfinished business...

226
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,500
Oh, Akitoshi!

227
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,740
Touru...

228
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,180
Yua-chan! Chie-chan!

229
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,610
Why are they naked?

230
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,880
What happened?

231
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,560
Wha!? Touru!

232
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,070
Forgive me, Akitoshi.

233
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,610
You finally show yourself.

234
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,870
Touru?

235
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,640
I've been waiting for this.

236
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,170
I thought you've gotten away
after that fight with Harumi-sensei.

237
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,860
Stop it Touru!

238
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,500
This is the end of the magical warrior...

239
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,440
Touru, why are you doing this?

240
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,540
This is revenge... to all humans.

241
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,710
What do you mean!?

242
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,010
Akitoshi, I've been attending
the school before you have.

243
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,320
It was when I barely started the school...

244
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,290
An older schoolmate asked me out...

245
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,090
That's nothing to hold hatred against.

246
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,220
What if it was... a man?

247
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,500
Let me tell you I don't swing that way.

248
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,910
When I declined his offer...

249
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,980
He called me out and...

250
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,590
And raped me with 3 others...

251
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,020
The insult of being sprayed with their cum...

252
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,830
People came and looked...

253
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,440
But no one came to the rescue...

254
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,670
Despair...

255
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,670
Akitoshi, do you know?

256
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,650
How I cursed being called cute!

257
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,010
But...

258
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,750
I came to a conclusion, to have revenge!

259
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,120
With powers that no one can come close too!

260
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:30,190
Touru. I know how you feel, but stop this!

261
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,390
You know how I feel?

262
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,560
How is that possible, you didn't experience it!

263
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,670
But...

264
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,940
Fine, Akitoshi. You think you
can stand the pain I experienced?

265
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,630
Well, do you think you can!?

266
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,420
S... op... Sto... p, Touru...

267
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,450
My pain is not even close!

268
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,120
How do you like my power, Akitoshi?

269
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,830
If I wanted to, I can snap you half.

270
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,960
...op, st... p, Touru...

271
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,040
You are...

272
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,530
pathetic.

273
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,110
You can't do much with those powers!

274
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,340
What!?

275
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,650
You are pathetic.

276
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,980
Your powers are not yours.

277
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,580
You are being controlled.

278
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,280
The real you is a puny bastard!

279
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,320
Is that all you have to say?

280
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,630
Fine, let me show you your so called weak powers!

281
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,770
Wait, you won't be able to use this rod.

282
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,970
If you want to use the rod, split Akitoshi with it.

283
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,170
Shit!

284
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,870
Do you have anything else to say?

285
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,650
I get excited when people rebel against me.

286
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,220
Wildly, that is!

287
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,290
Hah, do you like the pain!?

288
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,610
I hope you understand my pain at least a little.

289
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,410
I see, so you want to play tough... alright!

290
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,750
I will never surrender to you.

291
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,520
Touru, aren't you satisfied?

292
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,680
Stop it!

293
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,060
Your blood is delicious.

294
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,500
I'll suck your insides from down there!

295
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,230
Touru, Stop! I beg you!!

296
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,730
Akitoshi, you're annoying.

297
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,200
Shut up!

298
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,370
Peace and quiet at last.

299
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,470
I see...

300
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,150
So you don't want to open your legs.

301
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,820
However...

302
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,730
There is no blind spot for a woman's body.

303
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,030
This is what you get...

304
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,230
for insulting me!

305
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,700
You can not get away from me...

306
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,610
I will keep violating you!

307
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,010
Until you die!

308
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,760
The liquid being released is a deadly poison...

309
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:03,060
When absorbed during climax
you will keep climaxing until you die!

310
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,780
Until you die...

311
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,450
I will never forgive you!
