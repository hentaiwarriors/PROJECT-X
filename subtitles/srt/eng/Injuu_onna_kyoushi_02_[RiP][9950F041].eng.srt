1
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,683
Copter 1, Copter 1.
Give us your altitude.

2
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:25,054
Our altitude is currently 600 feet.

3
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,393
Please confirm our target.

4
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,960
Copter 1, you are currently right on target.

5
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,127
Confirmed.

6
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,583
Location confirmed.

7
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,848
We will land as soon as possible.

8
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,123
Confirmed.

9
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,751
Send a seven-man team
to investigate, as planned.

10
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,387
Roger that. Out.

11
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,234
There's debris in the air.

12
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,661
It's coming from the ground.

13
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:12,600
The ground?

14
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,871
What could it be?

15
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,380
School of Darkness 2

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,687
Report!

17
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,086
Ready, sir!

18
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,624
Prepare to land!

19
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:33,917
Yes, sir!

20
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,085
Lower the ropes!

21
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,462
Lowered, sir!

22
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,657
Attach your clips!

23
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,565
Equipment check!

24
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:46,732
Ropes, check!

25
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:47,432
Harness, check!

26
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,336
Three: Gloves, check!

27
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,100
Seat, check!

28
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,402
Other equipment, check!

29
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:53,578
Report!

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,840
Number one.

31
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:55,471
Number two.

32
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,048
Number three.

33
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,911
Number four.

34
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,473
Prepare to descend!

35
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,686
Let's go!

36
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,492
Team one, head west,
team two and three, head to the north.

37
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:16,227
Yes sir!

38
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:21,735
Whoa!

39
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,406
What is it?

40
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,875
Something has caught my leg, sir.

41
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,348
I need more detail, give me a report.

42
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,746
Yes sir, it's a vine of some sort, sir.

43
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,614
A vine of some sort?

44
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:40,984
A report, sir!

45
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,721
This whole area is covered
with these vines, sir.

46
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:45,490
What?

47
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,531
This area was battered by a storm
two days ago.

48
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,866
Did that have anything to do with this?

49
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,470
It looks like blood.

50
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,240
Maybe this was the debris we saw in the air?

51
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,647
I have never seen anything like this, sir.

52
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,476
Continue, but be very careful.

53
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:07,986
Sir!

54
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,688
Did all you guys have to dress like that?

55
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:21,233
But you said we could wear
what we wanted!

56
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,633
I heard you say that, too.

57
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,795
I heard that, too!

58
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,169
We're going camping
in the mountains, girls.

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,401
I heard you say that, too.

60
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,205
You guys just don't get it.

61
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,642
It's so damned, fucking hot.

62
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,510
Yuko, can't you do something about it?

63
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:40,041
Now, what makes you think I have control
over the heat?

64
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,644
Kyoko, all you've done is complain.

65
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,589
But it's just too damned hot!

66
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,920
Just get over it.

67
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:50,895
You said earlier that you didn't like
the air conditioning on.

68
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,631
We'll stop for a break soon,
so be patient, okay?

69
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,928
Damn it.

70
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,902
I can't stand it anymore!

71
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,863
Kyoko!

72
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,553
Hi!

73
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,419
She's a slut, as you can see.

74
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,461
Her name is Kyoko Sahara,
the troublemaker.

75
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,799
She likes video games and picking up men.

76
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,301
She'll try anything, as long as it's fun.

77
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,767
She's has a lot of experience with men.

78
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,701
I don't know how she does it.

79
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,580
Check this out!

80
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,614
She's known for her fresh
and healthy beauty.

81
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,055
Yuko Koizumi.

82
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,821
She's brilliant, and athletic.

83
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,892
She's also got a great body.

84
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,021
Tons of guys are after her.

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,693
She has absolutely no interest
in men, though.

86
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,405
Shit, I quit!

87
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,102
Akemi, take my place.

88
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,805
I'm not any good.

89
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,846
This is Akemi Yashiro, the quiet one.

90
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,711
She's really shy.

91
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,348
Akemi and Yuko have been
best friends for a while...

92
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,552
and Akemi's always hiding behind Yuko.

93
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,731
Here, put down this card.

94
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,324
Thanks!

95
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,630
There's something going on with these two.

96
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,334
That's not fair!

97
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,170
It's not fair to help her out like that!

98
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,071
And, this is me.

99
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,809
My name is Shiori Tachikawa.

100
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,511
I'm very popular, and sweet.

101
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,383
I'm cute and I'm smart.

102
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,047
I'm the most popular girl in school!

103
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,918
Okay, enough self-praise for now.

104
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,263
We have a storm moving in
from the western coast.

105
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:08,324
Please expect unpredictable weather
in the west and south counties.

106
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,403
The mountains should expect
some severe weather.

107
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,406
By nightfall, they should expect heavy rain
and thunderstorms in that region.

108
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,668
Please use extreme caution
if you are heading out this weekend.

109
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,807
Will we be okay, Tatsuya?

110
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,611
We'll be just fine.

111
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,873
The forecast is never right
when I go camping.

112
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:25,849
Don't worry.

113
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,443
Okay.

114
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,821
Sorry about the delay!
These two are the main characters.

115
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,761
This gorgeous lady
is our high school teacher.

116
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,228
Yayoi Mizuno.

117
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:45,628
Her beauty is like the beautiful flowers
on our campus.

118
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,366
Her smile is innocent, like a young girl.

119
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,544
Her figure is lean and very graceful.

120
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,707
She's understanding and kind.

121
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,448
But there's something else about her.

122
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,281
She is undeniably very sexy.

123
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,457
She is our idea of an ideal woman.

124
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,427
We want to be a wonderful teacher,
just like her.

125
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,060
But she is about to be married soon...

126
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,307
to Tatsuya Kubo, the biology teacher.

127
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,500
Who knows what she sees in this jerk.

128
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,375
We really can't believe it, but...

129
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,247
she's getting married to this stupid idiot
this summer!

130
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,982
So, us four members
of Ms. Mizuno fan club...

131
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:40,151
have decided to crash their camping trip
this weekend...

132
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,753
as a farewell party for Ms. Mizuno.

133
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,864
But Ms. Mizuno looks very pretty today.

134
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,829
And very happy.

135
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,964
We're here, guys!

136
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,984
How pretty!

137
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,197
Hey, let's go check out the lake!

138
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,027
Yeah, I want to ride on a boat!

139
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,202
How about it, Akemi?

140
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,028
Sure!

141
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,570
Let's go, then!

142
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,801
Not to rain on your parade, but...

143
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,513
You guys need to start unpacking
your things first.

144
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,044
Shoot, I forgot!

145
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,785
Well, let's go.

146
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,215
Have fun guys!

147
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,956
You too, Kyoko!

148
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:19,986
Damn it!

149
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,525
I need to go pee.

150
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,405
They'll take care of it.

151
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,443
I didn't come here to raise tents.

152
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,010
I can get other things to rise up, though.

153
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,354
Wait, I really have to go pee now.

154
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,453
I'll do it here.

155
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,547
You shouldn't pollute nature.

156
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,480
I don't like to hold it in, so bug off.

157
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,113
You don't have any paper to wipe yourself.

158
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,619
Then clean it with your tongue.

159
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,024
What!

160
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,915
Hey, I meant down there.

161
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,283
You're a demanding slut.

162
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,554
Smells like piss!

163
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,632
Don't you like it?

164
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,629
I haven't tasted enough to know.

165
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:25,983
More!

166
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,053
You can't have all the fun.

167
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,622
Suck on my cock, for a change.

168
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,289
I'd love to.

169
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,430
You have a nice, big one here.

170
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:43,930
I know.

171
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,234
I'm coming!

172
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,106
Here!

173
00:12:59,245 --> 00:12:59,904
Got it.

174
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,240
Let's see.

175
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:07,076
Hi there, do you need a hand?

176
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,318
I'm fine, thanks.

177
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:14,250
I know that pail is probably really heavy.

178
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,890
We can handle it just fine.

179
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,590
Let us help you.

180
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:20,791
Here, hand it over.

181
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,372
Look, you're bleeding.

182
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,173
Want me to lick it clean?

183
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,248
No thanks.

184
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:39,844
Don't touch Akemi!

185
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,452
Let go, you asshole!

186
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:46,517
Akemi!

187
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,856
Let go, and don't you dare touch her!

188
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,729
We'll take good care of her.

189
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,060
You guys suck at picking up women.

190
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,131
Fucker!

191
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,185
You are...

192
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,583
Tetsuji!

193
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,582
Are you okay.

194
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,348
Akemi, are you sure you're okay?

195
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,392
I'm all right.

196
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,556
Thanks to Tetsuji!

197
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:24,887
Yuko...

198
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:25,988
Let's go, Akemi.

199
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,461
Before any more creeps show up.

200
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:36,503
Yuko.

201
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,489
Pervert.

202
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,652
You're a peeping tom, aren't you?

203
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,888
That was a coincidence.

204
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,761
Whatever.

205
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:02,765
You're the easy, cocksucking, little slut.

206
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,599
You're the one that's getting
the enjoyment out of this.

207
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,268
You're having fun, too.

208
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,135
Maybe!

209
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,006
You're too damned good.

210
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,905
You've fucked a lot.

211
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,079
How about this?

212
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,321
That feels fucking awesome!

213
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,594
How about this?

214
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,797
How about a golden shower.

215
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,728
Wait, hold it!

216
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,837
Did I scare you?

217
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,500
That wasn't funny!

218
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:01,850
Yes, yes!

219
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,429
How about I play with these?

220
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,389
Yes!

221
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,027
More!

222
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:13,463
God!

223
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,702
Yeah!

224
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,131
I've brought something very special
for you today.

225
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,679
You want it that bad?

226
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,618
Here, take your time and enjoy it.

227
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,531
Now, you've also learned the taste of blood!

228
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,139
We were preparing dinner at that time.

229
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,219
Nobody had any idea of the terrors...

230
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,447
that we would face in the near future.

231
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,259
Wow!

232
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,932
This is beautiful, it's really pretty.

233
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,002
I thought you would like it.

234
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,547
You're so beautiful.

235
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,752
That white flower looks good on you.

236
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,756
Thanks.

237
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,825
White flowers are my favorite.

238
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,380
I love you, Yayoi.

239
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,250
Me too, Tatsuya.

240
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,988
You're gorgeous.

241
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,404
What's wrong?

242
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,337
I felt like someone was watching.

243
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,458
Your mind's just playing tricks on you.

244
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,591
You think so?

245
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,884
So, Yayoi.

246
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,892
We should head back now.

247
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,828
We can't keep the girls waiting for us.

248
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,858
All right.

249
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:18,912
That night...

250
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,148
we were finally finished
with all the cooking.

251
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,413
It looked okay.

252
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,355
Although it could have
probably tasted better.

253
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,694
Thank you, everybody!

254
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,266
Thanks, guys.

255
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,962
This guy here is Tetsuji Tsuchiya.

256
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,502
Kyoko's boyfriend.

257
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,601
He's known as a troublemaker...

258
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,112
but he's nothing compared to Kyoko.

259
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,612
She asked him to come...

260
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,583
so he rushed over here with a gift.

261
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,384
Thank you, Tetsuji.

262
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,686
The champagne must have been expensive.

263
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,826
Not really. It's no big deal.

264
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,056
Here, Akemi.

265
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,366
Thanks!

266
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,305
Hey, let's open it!

267
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,209
Okay, hand it over.

268
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,208
No, I'll open it.

269
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,886
I said hand it over!

270
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,680
No way!

271
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,023
Shiori!

272
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,328
I like Ms. Mizuno the best, so there.

273
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,995
No, you liar, give it up!

274
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,658
If you shake it, it's going to...

275
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,167
Explode like this.

276
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,382
It was a really great, fun party.

277
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:03,919
Everyone lost track of time, partying.

278
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:07,092
We laughed, and joked around
with each other.

279
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,151
We must have looked like one big,
happy family.

280
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,928
But...

281
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,795
that was to be our last dinner together.

282
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:41,624
Hey Yuko, did you notice?

283
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:42,925
What?

284
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:46,956
Tetsuji kept looking at you
since this afternoon.

285
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,960
Really?

286
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,195
I think he likes you, Yuko!

287
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,504
Men are such a pain in the ass!

288
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,834
I really could care less.

289
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,506
You really mean that?

290
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,676
Not even Tetsuji?

291
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,404
Really?

292
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:03,973
You swear?

293
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,617
Akemi...

294
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,011
Are you worried?

295
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,311
You're silly.

296
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,122
Yuko!

297
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,051
Will you?

298
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,800
You are.

299
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,684
Before any more creeps show up.

300
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,453
Bitch!

301
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:58,433
I wonder what those two are up to by now?

302
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,261
Who?

303
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,338
Mr. Kubo and Ms. Mizuno.

304
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:07,234
I'd bet you money that they're doing
it right now.

305
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,979
Doing it?

306
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,407
I'm going to go out.

307
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:16,586
Wait, Kyoko! That's a bad idea!

308
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,947
You sicko, I'm going to go pee.

309
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,817
Okay.

310
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,060
You scared me!

311
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,262
Until Kyoko said it...

312
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,892
I never thought of Ms. Mizuno like that.

313
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:32,366
I never saw her as a sexual person.

314
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,432
All of a sudden...

315
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,041
Ms. Mizuno felt so far away...

316
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,302
as if she was in
a completely different world.

317
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,878
I immediately felt like I was abandoned.

318
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,549
I felt as if she had left me behind.

319
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,289
Ms. Mizuno.

320
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,365
You look pretty.

321
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,184
I can't wait.

322
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:07,795
Yes!

323
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,679
You're so wet, Yayoi.

324
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,643
Look at my fingers!

325
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:28,715
Jerk!

326
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:29,915
Yayoi!

327
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,419
I promise to protect you forever.

328
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,592
Tatsuya!

329
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:44,734
Ms. Mizuno, my favorite teacher.

330
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,795
I worshipped her.

331
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,838
It was only an illusion...

332
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:53,238
but I thought we would
all be together, forever.

333
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,195
Please, Ms. Mizuno!

334
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,830
Don't leave me behind!

335
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,872
I soon found my fingers...

336
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,882
furiously playing with my wet pussy.

337
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:01,544
Promise, you'll never look at anyone
else like this.

338
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,327
That's my...

339
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,670
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

340
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,769
No, Yuko!

341
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,445
Forgive my weakness.

342
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,810
No, that's not true.

343
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:37,541
What?

344
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,184
I like you just the way you are.

345
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:44,854
Akemi.

346
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,822
I swear I'll do anything for you.

347
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:57,697
Yuko?

348
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,501
Yuko isn't interested in you.

349
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,336
What?

350
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:08,645
Now you know.

351
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,644
Yuko only sleeps with women.

352
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,515
Kyoko, did you know about this?

353
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,674
Akemi!

354
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,170
Yes.

355
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,911
I love you.

356
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,723
Look, isn't this your favorite?

357
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,354
Yeah, will you?

358
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,375
Cry out if you want to.

359
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,082
Please, don't torture me any more!

360
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,519
I love that expression on your face.

361
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,562
Yeah!

362
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,260
You're so hard and big tonight!

363
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:50,276
This is the very best!

364
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,749
Yuko, come for me!

365
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,985
Akemi, yes!

366
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,349
I'm coming!

367
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,164
Yes!

368
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,180
I'm going to come!

369
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,980
Yuko, come with me!

370
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,793
God!

371
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,694
Shit, it's a thunderstorm!

372
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:11,662
We need to get everyone.

373
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,457
Yes!

374
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,361
The storm was fierce.

375
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,769
It happened so suddenly.

376
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:26,173
We were battered by thunder,
relentless rain and blistering winds.

377
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,973
Shit! Run inside the forest!

378
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,156
All we had were our clothes.
We left everything behind.

379
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,691
We were just trying to find a safe spot.

380
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,422
We wandered through the dark forest.

381
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,156
We eventually lost our way back...

382
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,233
and could not get back to the camp.

383
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,064
We sat down, exhausted and scared.

384
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,297
Akemi, what's wrong?

385
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,267
Are you okay?

386
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,287
All right, we need to gather anything
that's edible.

387
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,557
If anything at all.

388
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,609
Gross.

389
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,046
Tatsuya?

390
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,551
That's...

391
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:45,553
That was the very last
of my emergency food.

392
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,050
I didn't have enough to share.

393
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:53,028
Look, we are their teachers.

394
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:57,133
We're the only ones that can lead them.
We have to stay healthy.

395
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:01,664
We still need to look for more food.

396
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:04,804
Sure.

397
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,582
We gathered as much as possible...

398
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,413
but it wasn't very much.

399
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,649
Was that all you could find?

400
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,391
Go back and bring back more food, damn it!

401
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,519
Tatsuya, stop!

402
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,597
We were worn out from exhaustion
and hunger.

403
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,901
Mr. Kubo unleashed his temper at us.

404
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,108
He started to scream at us
for the smallest things.

405
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,429
What's in there?

406
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:15,135
What is this?

407
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,277
It's sweet.

408
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,101
Tatsuya!

409
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:43,003
Yayoi, I found a flower in this cave.

410
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,035
It's dripping with sweet nectar.

411
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,675
Go and have some.

412
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,978
Tatsuya, you're acting strange?

413
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,607
What's going on?

414
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,012
Just come with me!

415
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,311
Stop, Tatsuya!

416
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,856
What's wrong?

417
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:05,822
What has gotten into you?

418
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,762
Yayoi, let's fuck.

419
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,299
What are you talking about?

420
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,239
Come on, we're going to be married soon.

421
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:23,505
I want to.

422
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:26,942
Stop it, Tatsuya, please stop!

423
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,152
Let go, Tatsuya, please don't!

424
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,630
Yayoi!

425
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,311
Who are you?

426
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,607
What are you doing?

427
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:32,377
Did you have any of the flower's nectar?

428
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:36,510
The flower? What flower?

429
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:41,515
Excuse me, but will you please
untie this rope?

430
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,730
What was that for?

431
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,736
I can give you some food.

432
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:53,896
I don't want it.

433
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,366
What a fine body.

434
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,203
Please stop, don't touch me!

435
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,439
I haven't had a woman in ages.

436
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,309
No, stop it!

437
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,439
No, stop it!

438
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:35,474
Please, let me go now!

439
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,113
Let me go, just stop it, stop!

440
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,652
No!

441
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,688
Why are you...

442
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:50,250
I'm going to teach you the taste
of the Garanta, too.

443
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:54,691
No, don't touch me, no!

444
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:58,224
Just let me go, and get away from me now!

445
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:01,497
- Get away from me, let me go!
- Yayoi!

446
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,654
Tatsuya!

447
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,188
You can nibble on this.

448
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,998
Is this is it, don't you have more?

449
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,570
If you want food,
then you need to do as I say.

450
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,836
You can undress this woman.

451
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:44,748
No!

452
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,478
What, aren't you hungry?

453
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,651
Tatsuya!

454
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,421
What are you doing to me?

455
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,231
You can endure this.

456
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,261
No, stop it Tatsuya, stop!

457
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,074
Here!

458
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,983
This is the nectar that I was talking about.

459
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,390
Don't!

460
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:37,901
Stop!

461
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,366
Once this enters the bloodstream...

462
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:44,236
it will highly increase your sexual appetite.

463
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,370
Stop, don't, please let me go, stop!

464
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,040
I like fighters.

465
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,081
No!

466
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,892
You're getting so wet already.

467
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,602
The flower will eventually call to you...

468
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,763
and you will mate with it.

469
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:31,247
Fifty years ago,
I worked for the government.

470
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,157
I was researching biological weapons.

471
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,821
I was cross-breeding different plants, and...

472
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:44,868
made countless number
of genetic mistakes, until...

473
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,903
I succeeded with the Garanta.

474
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,438
Once inside the human body...

475
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:54,802
it clouds the mind and changes
the genes of its hosts.

476
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:59,747
A perfect weapon, it eventually developed
defense mechanisms.

477
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,912
When we were transporting
the first specimen...

478
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,657
an accident occurred.

479
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,234
The plane crashed into this mountain.

480
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:26,242
I was miraculously, the only survivor.

481
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,911
Since then, I've lived with that plant.

482
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,183
Fortunately...

483
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:39,149
this climate was absolutely perfect
for the scattered samples.

484
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,723
Living off of various plants...

485
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:44,294
it continued to evolve.

486
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:48,057
Finally, it became the creature it is now!

487
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:53,300
The Garanta has never seen
a human woman.

488
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:07,150
I'm going to make sure the Garanta
really likes you.

489
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,220
No!

490
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,091
Yayoi?

491
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:18,123
Yayoi!

492
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,521
It's no use.

493
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,399
You can't escape from Garanta's forest.

494
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:29,202
Yayoi!

495
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,706
Go away, go away!

496
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,415
No!

497
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,898
Tatsuya!
