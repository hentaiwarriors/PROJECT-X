1
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,660
Delicious!

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,140
Ten of these per day is just not enough.

3
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,310
Maybe l should tell my grandfather to increase the limit.

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,950
You're eating them all by yourself.

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,680
How's the progress?

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,920
There hasn't been much progress.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,790
l'm sorry.

8
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,000
Geez.

9
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,330
l'm going to have a bad after taste by looking at your face!

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,270
l only want to hear good things! You know that!

11
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,340
Yes.

12
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,180
Come with me.

13
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,650
Tomomi-san, someone might see us like this.

14
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,670
You're the one who's rock hard.

15
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,140
But...

16
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,640
Look, l see some juice pouring out from your tip.

17
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,210
lf l rub this against the tip, it becomes a lubricant.

18
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,710
lt feels good!

19
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,120
You've become very sensitive.

20
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,760
l can see your ballsack is getting bigger.

21
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,030
A man's body is very interesting.

22
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,070
Are you going to climax?

23
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,910
Yes.

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,680
Then do the rest on your own.

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,770
What?

26
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,280
No fair!

27
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,680
Just do it.

28
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,920
Tomomi-san...

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,270
l'm coming, l'm coming.

30
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,860
l'm coming!

31
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,270
Tomomi-san...

32
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,750
l did a huge favor for you, so you better do a good job.

33
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,940
Got it?

34
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,950
Yes, l'll do my best!

35
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,900
<i>Princess 69 - Midnight
Gymnastics Vol. 2</i>

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,400
Now, let's begin.

37
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,460
Ready?

38
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,190
Smile Koyuki-chan!

39
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,760
Smile!

40
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,020
Okay.

41
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,390
Ouch!

42
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,410
Fubuki-chan, are you okay?

43
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,880
Koyuki-chan, you almost snapped off my cock.

44
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,480
l need you to concentrate more!

45
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,580
l'm sorry.

46
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,210
Maybe l'm not good enough for this.

47
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,120
Don't be pessimistic.

48
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,780
You can do it!

49
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,230
Let's give it our best.

50
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,230
Midnight Gymnastics...

51
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,030
Okay.

52
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,810
We're going to practice here?

53
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,970
Yeah, you need to be able to express your feelings.

54
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,080
But...

55
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,310
Think of these people around you as judges and spectators...

56
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,480
...for the Midnight Gymnastics, okay?

57
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,160
Koyuki-chan, you're already wet.

58
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,130
You're excited.

59
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,970
No...

60
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,630
Don't say no.

61
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,240
lf you're excited, then say it.

62
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,400
l can't...

63
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,480
Just pick it up.

64
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,420
No!

65
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,120
What are you embarrassed about?

66
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,380
lf you're excited, then you have to let them know.

67
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,290
That's why we're doing this.

68
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,890
l'm sorry...

69
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,200
Here we go Koyuki-chan.

70
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,660
Ready?

71
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,310
Koyuki-chan, does it feel good?

72
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,680
l don't know...

73
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,060
You're excited right?

74
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,550
lt feels good right?

75
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,280
Be honest.

76
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,460
lt feels so good.

77
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
Then smile!

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
Express your feelings with your smile!

79
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,430
But...

80
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,170
These people are here to see your cute smile!

81
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,670
You don't want to disappoint them.

82
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,640
l can't climax here...

83
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,250
lt's embarrassing...

84
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,290
No, l...

85
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,930
l...

86
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,590
Me too!

87
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,260
You were able to do it until the end.

88
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,540
Yeah.

89
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,710
That smile.

90
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,610
That smile will get you a perfect ten from every judge!

91
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,200
The world revolves around me.

92
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,230
But l'm not satisfied.

93
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,230
This world is boring.

94
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,240
This world should be destroyed with my command.

95
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,320
l'll never be happy.

96
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,050
l'm just a sad, miserable woman.

97
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,420
l'm tired.

98
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,650
Yo!

99
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,660
Thanks for cleaning up.

100
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,120
Where's Fujimiya-san?

101
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,430
She's in the shower.

102
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,670
Speaking of Fujimiya...

103
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,800
l'll show you something good.

104
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,430
Who is he?

105
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,470
Fujimiya's boyfriend!

106
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,210
l have more.

107
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,080
Give me that!

108
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,340
Give it back!

109
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,380
Where did you get that?

110
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,550
l saw them near a convenience store.

111
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,560
They seemed very happy, they're madly in love.

112
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,760
Koyuki-chan?

113
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,590
You took a candid shot?

114
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,790
How rude.

115
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,500
What, are you jealous?

116
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,470
You're jealous, aren't you?

117
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,400
Don't worry, you'll never get a boyfriend.

118
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,170
What did you say?

119
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,070
You have no boobs nor sexiness.

120
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,740
Who are you to say such things?

121
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,080
Hey, who's this in the picture?

122
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,180
My boyfriend.

123
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:51,850
This one.

124
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,550
That's my second boyfriend.
This one

125
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,420
How about this?

126
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,680
Probably my fourth.
How about this?

127
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,810
Fubuki-chan.

128
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,710
Lie against the wall and sit down.

129
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,150
What are you going to do?

130
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,620
Stay still.

131
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,620
Excited?

132
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,190
You probably get excited with any man you do it with.

133
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,160
What?

134
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,600
Fubuki-chan, what is this training?

135
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,610
This isn't training.

136
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,440
What?

137
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,610
No!

138
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,440
This is a punishment.

139
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,380
l can't let you see other guys behind my back.

140
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,620
What do you mean?

141
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,960
Don't fool with me.

142
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,690
Stop!
Don't fool with me.

143
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,420
My stomach hurts.

144
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,190
Please stop this Fubuki-chan.

145
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,790
Who's that guy you were with?

146
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,890
You two seemed very friendly.

147
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,730
No! That was...

148
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,600
lt hurts... My stomach will burst.

149
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,610
Please, let me go to the bathroom.

150
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,240
My stomach hurts!

151
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,180
l'll put a cork in it.

152
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,690
That guy was banging you like this, right?

153
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,460
My ass hurts...

154
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,590
lt'll burst!

155
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,670
You were having lots of fun behind my back, right?

156
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,490
l didn't do anything!

157
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,230
There's been a misunderstanding!

158
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,270
No!

159
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,240
No, no, no!

160
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,240
Oh no, it's flowing out...

161
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,600
Painful, right? Unbearable, right?

162
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,240
My heart feels the same way!

163
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,420
No...

164
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,680
l feel sad that you can't trust me!

165
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,450
lf l'm with you, l can do anything.

166
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,490
Trust me, Fubuki-chan.

167
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,260
l want you to trust me.

168
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,930
Then who was that guy?

169
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,630
l've known him since l was little, he's a childhood friend.

170
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,430
What?

171
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,340
l bumped into him by accident.

172
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,670
Then what happened?

173
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,310
He wanted to go out with me, but l refused.

174
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,640
That's all.

175
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,510
That's all l did!

176
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,650
Koyuki-chan!

177
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,990
l'm sorry Koyuki-chan.

178
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,820
l'm sorry.

179
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,450
l'm happy if you're satisfied.

180
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,860
But l can't hold it in!

181
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,900
Don't look...

182
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,230
Don't look...

183
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,320
Tomomi-san usually acts tough but l think she might be lonely.

184
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,370
She might kill me if l say that.

185
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,110
She's cute when she's quiet.

186
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,780
l want her to be more honest.

187
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,990
Why did she turn out like this?

188
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,960
Oh no!

189
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,450
l fell asleep.

190
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,890
l finished cleaning.

191
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,390
You didn't clean my area.

192
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,890
l'm leaving so you can clean the rest.

193
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,160
You better do a good job.

194
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,170
Do you smell something?

195
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,500
Smells like ink.

196
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,170
l don't smell anything.

197
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,010
Okay, then do a good job with the cleaning.

198
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,680
She's leaving early again?

199
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,910
She does whatever she wants...

200
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,820
Huh?

201
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,860
Oh no!

202
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,530
Huh?

203
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,960
These are...

204
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,040
Nobody can step into my heart.

205
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,840
Nobody...

206
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,720
Nobody...

207
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,440
Nobody...

208
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,560
Nobody...

209
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,530
Why don't you go accompany her?

210
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,160
You're right.

211
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,800
Nurse's Offiice

212
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,800
What? She's not here?

213
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,650
What are you doing?

214
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,060
Classes are in session.

215
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,250
What are you doing here, Tomomi-san?

216
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,160
Me?

217
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,260
l'm trying to maintain peace for this academy...

218
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,930
l see.

219
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,560
Come on, where are you going?

220
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,230
Koyuki-chan supposedly went to the nurse's office but she's not there.

221
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,800
Fujimiya?

222
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,880
She better not have ran away.

223
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,880
That's impossible!

224
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,940
Could it be...

225
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,920
Fubuki-chan!

226
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,930
Koyuki-chan, what are you doing?

227
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:33,370
l know classes are in session but l couldn't take it anymore...

228
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,940
l see...

229
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,940
l'm sorry for being so selfish.

230
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,640
lt's okay.

231
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,150
You were able to be honest with your feelings.

232
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,310
You became the girl l was hoping for!

233
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,950
Fubuki-chan, make love to me.

234
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,050
lt feels good.

235
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,990
You make me feel so good.

236
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,790
Fubuki-chan...

237
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,990
More, more...

238
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,290
Koyuki-chan!

239
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,910
l'm coming Koyuki-chan!

240
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,130
Me too!

241
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,400
l want you to climax with me!

242
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,010
l think we can do it now.

243
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,210
Yes.

244
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,420
Koyuki-chan, don't forget to smile.

245
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,090
Yes.

246
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,010
That's it Koyuki-chan!

247
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,270
Keep some distance between our bodies.

248
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,040
Yes.

249
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,460
We did it! lt's perfect!

250
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,060
Thank you Fubuki-chan.

251
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,980
Good job.

252
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,480
You did better than l expected, Fujimiya.

253
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,050
You did real good, l'll give you credit.

254
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,490
lt's all because of Fubuki-chan.

255
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,230
You're lucky to have such a good coach.

256
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,800
Yes.

257
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,800
l need to talk to your coach, so can you leave us?

258
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,240
The darkness of Midnight Gymnastics...

259
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,010
...is a condition where you stop opening up to others.

260
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,750
lf you don't accept Midnight Gymnastics in your heart...

261
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,250
...your feelings of denial eventually take over you...

262
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,850
...and prevents you from opening up to other people.

263
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,350
l see.

264
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,190
Koyuki-chan was able to express her feelings honestly.

265
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,820
That's why the darkness didn't take over her.

266
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,830
Really?

267
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,040
So in order to get my sister back to normal...

268
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,400
...we just have to start over from scratch.

269
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,840
Of course, l'll be the one to help her.

270
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,500
Tomomi-san?

271
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,980
You're just too good.

272
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,850
What do you mean?

273
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,250
Do you still believe in these Midnight Gymnastics?

274
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,260
What do you mean?

275
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,060
That was all a lie.

276
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,570
You were too serious, so l just wanted to tease you.

277
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,600
lt can't be...

278
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,260
You're kidding right?

279
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,440
You were too serious about all this.

280
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,340
You must be kidding me.

281
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,570
lt can't be...

282
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,970
But l can tell you one thing.

283
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,850
That Fubuki Haneoka was a real good toy.

284
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,080
l'm just your toy?

285
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,890
Am l wrong?

286
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,960
l know you care about your sister.

287
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,190
But who's dumb enough to dress up like a girl...

288
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,560
...to go to an all-girls academy?

289
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,600
l can't believe you even wore leotards.

290
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,240
What's the matter?

291
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,840
You realized how dumb you were?

292
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,270
You're a really sad person.

293
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,040
Huh? What are you saying?

294
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,880
Those are...

295
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,920
This is the reason why you stopped opening up to others, right?

296
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,290
You're just trying to forget this humiliation...

297
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,300
...by pretending you're a person of strong will.

298
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,870
You're the one who's caught in the darkness.

299
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,430
So what?

300
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,940
Are you threatening me with those photos?

301
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,480
How much do you want?

302
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,340
Ouch!

303
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,220
Let me go!

304
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,080
What are you doing?

305
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,590
Now, let's begin.

306
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,100
We'll start training for the Midnight Gymnastics.

307
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,630
l'll teach you real good.

308
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,170
My hands...

309
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,230
They'll snap off.

310
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,690
Ouch, ouch!

311
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,260
My boobs will be uneven! My nipples will come off!

312
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,060
Let me go.

313
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,730
Let me go.

314
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,100
Shut up!

315
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,020
You don't need these!

316
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,080
No.

317
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,020
lt hurts!

318
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,020
lt hurts?

319
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,090
Stop lying!

320
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,690
What's this?

321
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,460
l'm asking you to answer me!

322
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,460
You get excited with things like this!

323
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,340
Be honest, you want more stimulation.

324
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,470
lsn't that right?

325
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,010
No!

326
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,480
You want more? Huh?

327
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,310
Okay, let's move on to the back.

328
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,390
Can't you hear me?

329
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,480
Right here!

330
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,160
l'm gonna stick this in here.

331
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,250
Stop!

332
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,230
Anything but that!

333
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,100
Shut up!

334
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,600
So tight.

335
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,140
But now the front is all vacant.

336
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,710
l'll fix that.

337
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,450
No, stop it!

338
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:31,710
You probably don't know this but your oblique teeth feel real good.

339
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,040
l'm coming again.

340
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,090
This is yours, wear it!

341
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,400
Get up!

342
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,490
No!

343
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,340
