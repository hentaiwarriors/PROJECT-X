1
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,287
Are you awake yet?

2
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,355
Uh... yeah...

3
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,357
Morning!

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,484
Breakfast is almost ready.

5
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,373
Well, I'll see you later!

6
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,175
Hurry home, dear!

7
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,136
Wait.

8
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,889
What's wrong?

9
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,351
I'd prefer this... to a kiss.

10
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:05,264
Hey!

11
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,402
Instead of a "good-bye kiss" how about some "good-bye" hanky-panky?

12
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:13,439
Idiot! What are you saying, this early in the morning...!

13
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,044
Aw, come on - it's okay...

14
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,374
S-S-Stop it!!!

15
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,789
Are you all right? You look like you're having a nightmare.

16
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,724
Hey! Teach, let up!

17
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:45,104
Just a dream...

18
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,485
Ah-hah! He's rock hard!

19
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,845
Idiot! Stop that!

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,083
That must have been some sexy dream. If that's the case...

21
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,457
how about continuing where you left off?

22
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,547
<i>I'm Tokiro Ehara, in my first year of teaching.</i>

23
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:31,717
<i>Through a lot of different circumstances, one of my students, Miyako Hase,</i>

24
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:35,588
<i>has come to be living together with me. The past two months have gone by fast...</i>

25
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,858
HOMEROOM
AFFAIRS

26
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,929
<i>An 19 Year Old High School Senior Is Hot for Teacher.</i>

27
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:49,877
Part 2: I Was Born Reckless!

28
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,130
Teach... I'll wash your back for you.

29
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,163
Okay, Okay. You're wearing a swimsuit again, right.

30
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,676
Uh-huh. You can't take me by the same way twi... yi!

31
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,682
And you can make me clean, too.

32
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,885
You must be kidding!

33
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,226
Oh no, come on, pull it together.

34
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,232
Ouch... Look, will you please out the pranks...

35
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,570
I'm sorry. Did it hurt?

36
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,130
<i>What's with her, her attitude's changed all of a sudden...</i>

37
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,758
<i>Oh no, she won't trick me like that!</i>

38
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,595
And stop teasing people too, while you're at it!

39
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,499
Trying to seduce me all the time. It won't work!

40
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,311
I wasn't teasing you...

41
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,312
I didn't think you'd be that dense, teach! And if you're going to be...

42
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,782
like that all the time then you should stay a virgin!

43
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,817
Hey!

44
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:48,871
Who do you think you're talking to like that? That's no way to talk to an older person!

45
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,431
Even though she's always kidding around,

46
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,058
she was really angry...

47
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:12,044
It couldn't be...?

48
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:21,237
<i>Where do the lies stop and the truth starts?</i>

49
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,066
Bye-bye! See you tomorrow!

50
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,337
Miyako! Let's go home together!

51
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,592
I heard the small shop by the station is having a sale.

52
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:43,876
Really?

53
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,012
Let's stop in on the way home.

54
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,347
Conference on the way home?

55
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,266
Oh, it's you, Mr. Ehara!

56
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,979
Ah, you're lucky!

57
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:56,421
I've got a teacher's meeting right now so I don't know what time I'll be getting home.

58
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,061
Don't be too late on your way home, ladies!

59
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:03,570
Yes, sir!

60
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,708
Hey, guys!

61
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,127
Don't you think Mr. Ehara's kind of cute?

62
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,880
Is Mr. Ehara your type, Emi?

63
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,925
Well, these days he's been wearing those worn-out shirts.

64
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,887
Whenever I see that kind of thing I just can't leave it alone!

65
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,023
I'd like to go to his house and iron his shirts for him.

66
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,518
You've got the mothering instinct, Emi!

67
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,828
How about stopping by his house?

68
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,146
That's all right!!!

69
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,482
I'll be careful to see that that sort of thing doesn't happen again!

70
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,028
What sort of thing will you be careful about, Miyako?

71
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:54,480
Now then, I'd like to hear the opinions of the teachers concerned with this problem...

72
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,086
<i>That Miyako... I wonder if she's still angry...?</i>

73
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,289
...your opinion, Mr. Ehara?

74
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,009
Mr. Ehara!!!

75
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,136
Mr. Ehara!

76
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,099
Yes, sir!

77
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,729
Mr. Ehara, you really shouldn't let your attention wander...

78
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,740
during a staff meeting. It slows things down.

79
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,149
Yes, sir.

80
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:28,531
Ehara, you too are a teacher in this elite school of ours, so give it your all!

81
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,118
If you can't, there will be trouble...

82
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm sorry, sir.

83
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,463
Long time no see, Miyako.

84
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:50,985
Kou...

85
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,390
'Been looking all over for you, Miyako.

86
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,712
Well, let's not stand out here. We can talk more inside.

87
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,780
No!

88
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,183
Not here, not this room!

89
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,720
It'd be bad for your "older brother", huh?

90
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:16,495
I know everything. You've been flirting around with him here, haven't you?

91
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,709
Okay, if here's no good then follow me.

92
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,917
<i>That was a long time ago...</i>

93
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:42,755
<i>It was a night when... Oh, I don't know why, I just didn't want to be alone.</i>

94
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,124
<i>So I went out for a walk.</i>

95
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:50,279
<i>Kou called out to me.</i>

96
00:08:55,285 --> 00:09:00,248
I don't need it. I have enough money so give me something tangible!

97
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,814
<i>Whenever he chooses something to give to me he'll be thinking of me.</i>

98
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,302
<i>He'll recall everything about me.</i>

99
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:18,850
<i>My feelings of loneliness would then disappear.</i>

100
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:24,981
<i>And we continued on like that. Live and let live.</i>

101
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,858
We're here.

102
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,997
There's nothing to be embarrassed about now, is there?

103
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,463
<i>Looks like she's still angry.</i>

104
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:06,063
Oh well, this will be the first time in a long time I can make myself at home.

105
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,549
Look, I just...

106
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,019
Shall I wait for you outside the school tomorrow?

107
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:22,154
That... That would be...

108
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,042
Trouble, huh? A guy like me hanging around the grounds of the...

109
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,712
high-class Mitsuba Girls' School.

110
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,038
Miyako, come over to my place.

111
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:45,111
Your pop's business is gone, you got no place, right? So...

112
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,188
won't you stay with me?

113
00:10:47,786 --> 00:10:49,015
Kou...

114
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,485
I'm serious.

115
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,602
Hey, Miyako, is dinner ready...?

116
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,774
Yeah...

117
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,168
It's peaceful when she's not around.

118
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,371
Too peaceful...

119
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,813
Stop it!

120
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,848
What's wrong, all of the sudden?

121
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,318
I forgot it's that time of the month for me.

122
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,707
Even though you're not wearing a tampon or napkin...

123
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,746
How did he...!?

124
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:11,022
Why are you so unwilling? Is it the guy you're with now?

125
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:15,635
I've been with you longer. You may have forgotten that...

126
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,863
but I bet your body remembers!

127
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,410
Now relax a little more.

128
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,385
<i>What's the matter with me?</i>

129
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:36,355
<i>Not too long ago I was bopping along without a care.</i>

130
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:41,327
<i>Not too long ago I was by myself but I didn't feel lonely, still...</i>

131
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,056
<i>Ever since I've been staying with Mr. Ehara...</i>

132
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:48,668
<i>it seems like I'm doing the worst thing possible.</i>

133
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,939
<i>Ever since I've been living with Miyako...</i>

134
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,108
<i>whenever she's not around I feel empty inside.</i>

135
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,071
<i>Teach!</i>

136
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,951
<i>I... need her!</i>

137
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:10,489
Teach...

138
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,259
I gotta pee!

139
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,828
What!? Now!?

140
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,765
Please let me go to the toilet! Else I'm going to let go right here!

141
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,430
Hurry up and go!

142
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:42,355
At any rate, this buys me a little time. But what am I going to do now?

143
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,946
Uh... Hi there!

144
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,951
Miyako! How long are you going to be in there?

145
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:15,388
She... she didn't...?

146
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:24,463
I don't believe this!

147
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,935
This is the fourth floor!

148
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,350
Teach.

149
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,419
Miyako!? Where are you!?

150
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:47,566
SAGAYA STATION

151
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,871
Miyako!

152
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,081
Teach!

153
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,518
You're late, teach!

154
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:19,986
Miyako...!

155
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,462
You stupid idiot!

156
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:35,902
What in the world happened? You've got no shoes on, and in a place like this...

157
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,572
Would you crouch down for a sec?

158
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,574
What's wrong?

159
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,244
I'm not wearing any panties.

160
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:49,958
The truth is, just when I was about to be raped by the demon king up in his sky castle...

161
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,852
he traded me my shoes and panties in exchange for my body.

162
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,821
Who would believe such a ridiculous story!?

163
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,626
I'm looking like this cause I escaped in the middle of it, aren't I?

164
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,797
The only thing that makes sense around here is nonsense.

165
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,937
Anyway, let's go home. I can hear all the details later.

166
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,305
Okay!

167
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,645
What's wrong?

168
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,652
I'm so relieved that I can't stand up.

169
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,596
Teach, I'm not too heavy, am I?

170
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:38,731
Oh, for the love of Christ!

171
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,383
Say, Miyako... I realized something today. While I was waiting for...

172
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:01,812
your call, I was by myself for the first time in a long while...

173
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,293
Uh... How can I put it...? I've been thinking about your...

174
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:11,739
Miyako...? She's sleeping.

175
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,372
<i>Figures I couldn't say it.</i>

176
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,892
Look, uh... Miyako...

177
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,227
What?

178
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,796
About yesterday...

179
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,865
You don't have to worry about a thing, really?

180
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,141
Let's go! We'll both be late!

181
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:00,162
Yeah!

182
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,495
Aren't you the close-knit pair this morning?

183
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,217
Kou!

184
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,836
Who are you?

185
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,873
Miyako's "significant other".

186
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,526
You look like you had some success too.

187
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,654
Using a homeroom teacher's standing to shack up with one's own student.

188
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,951
I bet you had a good time last night, huh?

189
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:42,955
After all, Miyako's quite the little technician.

190
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:47,026
You put on such a proper face but what goes on underneath?

191
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:50,630
That's why you can never trust a teacher!

192
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:58,304
Stop it! I apologize for yesterday, all right?

193
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,173
Anyway, go on home.

194
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,243
"I apologize, so go home", you say?

195
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,914
How long do you think you can keep playing with people, huh?

196
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,592
Take your hand off her!

197
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,929
Hmph, it doesn't matter.

198
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,957
Today my business is with you.

199
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,294
I wonder if you'd meet with me this evening for a little bit?

200
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,422
I'll contact you later at school as to where.

201
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:37,969
I'll give you them back to you then, Miyakok's shoes, that is...

202
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,112
'Later!

203
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,988
Miyako... I want an explanation.

204
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,131
You went with him to a hotel?

205
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,702
Well, there was no help for it, was there?

206
00:20:02,863 --> 00:20:06,581
If I didn't he said he'd come to the school.

207
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:14,046
But believe me... nothing happened yesterday.

208
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:21,787
Nothing happened... not one thing...

209
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,723
That's why I didn't have any panties on!!!

210
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:28,261
If I'd done it I'd have had my panties on and left the hotel!

211
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,564
You're a teacher...

212
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:33,699
and you can't even understand that...!

213
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:40,406
Jesus, that's not something you go shouting about like that!

214
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:44,744
After all, I was telling the truth. You didn't believe me so I had to.

215
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:52,118
Your appointment with Kou... please break it.

216
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,922
He used to be with a gang, he's got a rough disposition, too.

217
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,723
If you go he won't just let you leave unharmed!

218
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:11,137
That's all the more reason to go then. Don't worry.

219
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,528
<i>So, she couldn't play false. That guy and Miyako have up to now been...</i>

220
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:37,078
Mr. Ehara of Class 2-5, there's phone call for you.

221
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:39,045
Please come to the office as soon as possible.

222
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,804
We repeat: Mr. Ehara, there's a telephone call for you.

223
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:48,274
Please come to the office as soon as possible.

224
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:50,710
Hey, Miyako...

225
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,047
Miyako!

226
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,050
What is up with you?

227
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:01,053
You seem awfully worried about something.

228
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:04,223
You don't think, is it that time of the month?

229
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,392
Uh... yeah... maybe that's it...

230
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,660
Will you quit it, it's lunch time!

231
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,299
Oops, sorry!

232
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:24,210
Look! I'm not taking you with me!

233
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:27,647
Come on! If you go alone, Teach, I'll be worried.

234
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:30,816
If you're there I'll really be worried.

235
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,986
You know nothing about Kou, Teach!

236
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:37,290
Anyway, go home!

237
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,826
The meeting time is probably about five or six o'clock.

238
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:43,896
The place is some area where not many people come to.

239
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:45,731
"And make sure you come alone."

240
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:49,168
How do you know the content of our phone conversation?

241
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,804
That's the way his kind thinks.

242
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:58,811
Kou is a lot more dangerous than you imagine, Teach.

243
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:03,816
The reason he quit school was because he beat up his homeroom teacher.

244
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:19,524
So please don't go!

245
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,540
No, I have no reason to run.

246
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,549
Then, I must be there with you.

247
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,018
Miyako...

248
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,376
Who are these guys!?

249
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:06,487
Old friends of mine from school.

250
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:11,217
I see the student you've been blissfully banging has come to plead your case.

251
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:14,954
Heh heh... Look, he's got stubble.

252
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:18,758
You wouldn't think he could do it with a girl years younger than him!

253
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,093
And at a famous school to boot!

254
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:27,533
Uh-huh... His type is always arrogant. Well, I'm not putting up with it!

255
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:32,171
Will you get real!

256
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:35,975
How long do you plan on keeping up this ridiculous shit!?

257
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,252
Miyako!

258
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:49,088
Miyako!!

259
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:53,559
Teach!

260
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:56,362
Evil man, seducing a student from a girls high school.

261
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,097
Guys, punish this bastard!

262
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:00,700
Are you all right, teacher?

263
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:03,135
It's a little early...

264
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:05,204
to be taking a nap!

265
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,907
Stop it!!!

266
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:10,760
Please! Say something to make them stop!

267
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:13,625
Leave him!

268
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:16,182
What!?

269
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,753
He's got no guts. Come on, make it interesting!

270
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,732
Look at that clumsy body. He's got no strength, either.

271
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:28,569
Yet he's full of arrogance before everyone.

272
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:31,989
Teachers — they're all the same!

273
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:36,502
Kou... could it be like it was before...

274
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,081
Miyako...

275
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,790
Yeowww!!!

276
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,633
Miyako...

277
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:09,035
Not so fast.

278
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:13,239
It's not enough to just cut his arm. You still haven't paid for your sins!

279
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:14,824
Damn right!

280
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:16,809
Take him out! Yeah!

281
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,911
Hey, everybody!!!

282
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:24,984
Why that...!

283
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:39,866
Whoa!!!

284
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,868
Super!

285
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:44,687
Don't look!!

286
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:52,044
Oh, shit!

287
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:53,346
Somebody must've reported the noise!

288
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:54,714
Run!!

289
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,987
Hang in there, Teach!

290
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,193
Nooo!!!

291
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:32,051
Mr. Ehara...

292
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,953
Where... where am...

293
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:38,124
Emergency hospital. You're all right, you just got a light concussion.

294
00:27:38,384 --> 00:27:39,350
I see...

295
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,960
Ow ow ow ow!

296
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:43,454
Uh-huh, you've got to rest.

297
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,878
There should be no complications.

298
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:54,574
At any rate, shall we contact the school?

299
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:59,111
Since it's a famous school like Mitsuba we should do it first thing.

300
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:09,789
Miyako, I'm sorry. I...

301
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:14,927
The truth is, I had to protect you.

302
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:19,131
Teach...

303
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,291
Well, I'm going!

304
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:54,200
Miyako, today's the same as yesterday, be careful.

305
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,035
Okay.

306
00:28:56,236 --> 00:29:01,207
Jeez, your behavior is so reckless it's dangerous. Look, I'm on edge here.

307
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:07,847
Don't you ever pull a rash stunt like yesterday's again, understand?

308
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:29,936
Bye!

309
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:37,276
Th... that girl...

310
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:41,814
I was born reckless!

311
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:46,285
<i>She had the nerve to do it then.</i>

312
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:50,957
<i>Still...</i>

313
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:55,294
To get my first kiss at age 26...

314
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,501
What a homely face.

315
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,840
Pardon me.

316
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:10,009
No, the fault was mine.

317
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:15,681
Kou! Try anything funny and I'll yell "Help, pervert!"

318
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,874
Don't worry. So, now what happens?

319
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:21,821
I don't know!

320
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,826
Miyako, why did you strip down that time?

321
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:33,099
If the police hadn't come then...

322
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,234
you'd have been gang banged.

323
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:37,904
Didn't you think things out that far?

324
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:42,375
I was so carried away I didn't have time to think about it.

325
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:56,720
Well, you can tell him for me if he's going to protect you he needs to get tougher.

326
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,431
I mean, what do you see in him, anyway?

327
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:10,469
I mean, he's not rich, no ladies man, he's weak.

328
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:13,940
Now that you mention it, you're right.

329
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:15,374
Oh, come on!

330
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,479
I hadn't thought about what I see in him.

331
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:26,118
<i>After all, he's always angry, he's clumsy, his serious nature is his one good point.</i>

332
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:29,455
<i>He's really not my type at all.</i>

333
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:34,160
You know, I wonder what do I see in him.

334
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:43,503
Myoga Station. Myoga.

335
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:47,607
Bye, Miyako!

336
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:55,202
Kou...

337
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:05,625
"What do I see in him", huh? When you say you don't know what you like...

338
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:09,695
about someone it means you like everything about them.

339
00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:19,505
<i>Good-bye, Kou.</i>

340
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:28,573
<i>Still, it's funny.</i>

341
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:34,554
<i>That first time we met all I'd thought was to seduce him.</i>

342
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:39,058
<i>But since we've come to live together, since Dad's company went bust...</i>

343
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,297
<i>lots has happened in the course of things. Still...</i>

344
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,567
<i>All of a sudden...</i>

345
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:17,630
Miss Miyako Hase of Class 2-5, am I right?

346
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:21,200
I'm Mr. Kishida, the vice principal.

347
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:26,281
You won't need to go to class today if you would come with me.

348
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:28,040
Okay...

349
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:54,433
Principal's Office

350
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:56,669
Come in.

351
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:02,625
Teach!

352
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,126
Miyako!

353
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:06,587
So you're Miss Miyako Hase?

354
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:07,914
Yes.

355
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:13,553
Now then, Tokiro Ehara, homeroom teacher of 2-5...

356
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,270
Last night, we were contacted by the police.

357
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:25,690
The two of you were attacked by thugs, it seems.

358
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:28,501
Yes.

359
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:29,936
And the reason?

360
00:34:30,504 --> 00:34:32,038
That... I cannot say.

361
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:36,075
So it would seem.

362
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:40,780
Ehara, we know everything.

363
00:34:41,014 --> 00:34:44,750
After yesterday's incident, various matters were looked into.

364
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:50,256
First, we know of the honorless tale...

365
00:34:51,024 --> 00:34:55,011
which one of the thugs the police captured put Mr. Ehara in.

366
00:34:55,395 --> 00:35:02,577
For the honor of the school, I made a confirming call to the super of your apartment.

367
00:35:02,905 --> 00:35:03,970
After that...

368
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:08,374
the two of you are living together, aren't you?

369
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,844
This is a mess!

370
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:15,648
There has never been such a scandal in the entire proud history of our school!

371
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:21,754
If word of this ever leaked to outside sources our school's status would fall.

372
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:25,424
We could never face the PTA.

373
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:30,530
<i>Finally the time I feared has come.</i>

374
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:33,432
<i>I don't care what happens to me...</i>

375
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:44,110
<i>But somehow, I've got to protect Miyako! But... but how... what should I do!?</i>

376
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:49,440
Ehara, you will decide to quit this school, I expect.

377
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:54,445
As for Miss Hase, we'd like her to leave voluntarily.

378
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:57,590
But... but that's...

379
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,620
Let's take care of the formalities quickly.

380
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:04,664
Just one minute!

381
00:36:05,966 --> 00:36:08,634
We... we are not just living together.

382
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:11,604
The truth is... we...

383
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:15,049
We're getting married!!

384
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:21,597
We started living together as a prerequisite to our getting married.

385
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:24,517
Her parents also agreed to this!

386
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,520
Certainly there is no school regulation...

387
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:30,523
which states "teacher may not marry a student"!

388
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,066
Well...

389
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:35,069
But if this leaks to the outside!!

390
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:40,533
If Miyako's expelled I'll inform them myself.

391
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:45,371
And the media will be laughing loud and long.

392
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:05,258
I don't believe it! I just do not believe it!

393
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:10,596
We are getting married! You would stay the first thing that came into your head!

394
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:16,469
At any rate, thanks to that little scene we got a temporary reprieve.

395
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:20,540
<i>It wasn't the first thing that popped into my head.</i>

396
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,542
<i>There was truth in there, too.</i>

397
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:32,285
Oh now! What am I going to do?

398
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:39,834
Uh, listen... It wouldn't work?

399
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:44,363
What I said back there... It wasn't just off the cuff. Really...

400
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:47,300
Won't you marry me?

401
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:17,430
Maybe it's unbelievable something like this could happen so suddenly.

402
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:19,866
But I never...

403
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:23,002
No.

404
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:26,706
Getting married at my age? You must be kidding!

405
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:30,409
I don't want to even think about things like that!

406
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:35,414
Yeah, there's that, too. Hah hah hah hah!

407
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:40,753
<i>I said, didn't I?</i>

408
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:48,394
Was it that much of a shock?

409
00:38:48,795 --> 00:38:50,096
Miyako?

410
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:56,102
That was just a lie! If it's with you, Teach, okay!

411
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:59,405
Miyako!

412
00:39:01,808 --> 00:39:06,779
After all, no one else has been so protective of me up to now.

413
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,649
Hey, look over there! Oh wow!

414
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:11,817
Whoa! Go ahead, girl!

415
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:17,456
Isn't that Mr. Ehara? Oooh, I'm so jealous!

416
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,488
Hey, that's Miyako and Mr. Ehara!

417
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,499
I don't believe it!

418
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,505
To behave so shamelessly in such a place!

419
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:40,505
If I'm going to be your wife I'll give you lots of service.

420
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:52,525
Idiot! Will you stop! Not in public!

421
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,195
Now, now. It's okay, isn't it?

422
00:39:56,563 --> 00:40:00,533
If we're going to be husband and wife we can have sex unashamedly.

423
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:14,580
Oh, your face is red! You are so naive, Teach!

424
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:21,504
Hey!!

425
00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:26,592
Will you stop making fun of people!

426
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:37,103
Hang in there, Mr. Ehara!!

427
00:40:57,891 --> 00:41:00,393
Why'd you lock the door!? Let me in!

428
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:02,712
No, you'll peek.

429
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,714
I'm not going to peek!

430
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:07,884
No matter what you say the answer is no.
