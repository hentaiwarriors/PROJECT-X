1
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,773
Luric Ruleek, the path of
no return.

2
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,071
Showing you the road eight times...

3
00:01:27,178 --> 00:01:29,840
...those with courage
returning three.

4
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:34,316
What do you mean?
I have no choice but to go!

5
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:33,568
Why are the shriekers after us?

6
00:02:33,678 --> 00:02:36,579
There're after women.
Human women.

7
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:37,375
What?!

8
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:40,183
I heard these guys...

9
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,254
...reproduce using human women
to plant their eggs in.

10
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:44,983
What?

11
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:49,519
I summon the protection
of the house of Yugdrasil...

12
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,528
...Ehwy Ahweh, Loki, oh, Loki...

13
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,927
...hear my voice.

14
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:57,160
The sword of Ruun,
show me a miracle!

15
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,840
It didn't work!
There's too many of them!

16
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:14,476
Muppa!

17
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:21,382
Take that!

18
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:34,161
Ew Woowy Neu Teel Teel,
grant me the power!

19
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,402
No!

20
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:49,514
No!

21
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:03,966
No!

22
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,770
No!

23
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,035
No!

24
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:40,357
When the power of the
constellation of Lukes...

25
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,592
...descends upon us...

26
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,692
...the evildoers shall be
condemned.

27
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,170
Evoke Lukes Anti Viru!

28
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,297
Ateriel!

29
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:02,878
Grant me the power!

30
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,512
In this moment in which
I possess the wisdom...

31
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:07,784
...thou shall strike down...

32
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:10,053
...the soulless scourge!

33
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:13,886
Evoke Ignis Fireball!

34
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,188
Hey, wake up! Hey!

35
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:44,094
You all right? Hey! Hey!

36
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:54,093
Thank you.

37
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,454
She seems to be sleeping well.

38
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,290
I'm glad my potion worked on her.

39
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,730
She's a sorcerer of the craftsman
level like you.

40
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,301
She is?

41
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,701
Yes. Frenieple Slaipny Sen.

42
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:29,295
She's our master.

43
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:31,904
My name is Liao.

44
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,170
I'm a monk of the Deepankala Sect.

45
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:37,113
I'm Meruru Sheckle.
Nice to meet you.

46
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:40,677
Is that insignia from Riledihaim?

47
00:07:40,785 --> 00:07:43,379
Don't tell me you came all
the way from there?

48
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:44,785
It's the edge of the world...

49
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:47,119
Oh, I'm sorry.

50
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,221
Don't worry about it. It's the truth.

51
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,959
My home is in Selica.

52
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:56,226
I'm a barbarian from beyond
the edge of the world.

53
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,201
Are you awake? How do you feel?

54
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,699
All right...

55
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:07,667
I'm all right now.

56
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,248
What? You're after the Likuu
book of sorcery too?

57
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:13,783
Yes. I take it you are?!

58
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:16,683
I guess those going in for
sorcery are all the same.

59
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:20,214
Then you must be seeking
the Lanini monastery as well.

60
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:22,182
Yes, that's right.

61
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,458
Then, let's go together.

62
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:25,855
I'd love that!

63
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,954
The good will of travel companions...

64
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:31,125
...begets a party of
strong travel partners.

65
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:33,703
What a party! What a party!
How auspicious!

66
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:25,143
Ehwoh Eyaweh Yawoh...

67
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,241
...Ansaz Ansab, hear my voice.

68
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:31,344
We are your daughters,
Yellar Aluchis.

69
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:34,515
Come forth. We are your disciples.

70
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,389
Ehwoh Eyah Woh Yahwoh.

71
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:41,261
Ehwoh Eh Yahwoh, Ingis Ingis...

72
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:45,563
Lord, our father...
Come forth to Ruun.

73
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:14,588
This is no good.

74
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:17,133
I think we got lost.

75
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:20,567
Leave this to me.

76
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:23,170
As my spirit melds with...

77
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:25,265
...the spirits of the Vintos...

78
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:28,174
...grant me wings for my soul.

79
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,646
Evoke Vintos Locate!

80
00:11:46,263 --> 00:11:49,391
Thunderbolt of Ruun!
Give me a miracle!

81
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:51,594
Jurido Blasting!

82
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:12,215
SAHAGI NA FALLS

83
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:14,655
The bridge must've been
washed out by the flood.

84
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,994
There's no way we can swim
to the other side.

85
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,600
I never learned Aqua Breaching...

86
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,694
...or Hydro Walking.

87
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:31,204
Levitation won't get me
across either.

88
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:37,175
We'll just have to go to the
other bridge upstream.

89
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,306
Let's just pray it wasn't
washed out too.

90
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,386
Liao!

91
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,894
Bolboi.

92
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:58,289
We're lucky this year.

93
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:03,898
We should be able to produce
strong babies with these bodies.

94
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:06,629
Babies? What do you mean?!

95
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:08,466
Don't play dumb.

96
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:11,234
We're gonna lay eggs
in your body...

97
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,640
...and we're gonna fertilize them.

98
00:14:13,744 --> 00:14:17,578
And that baby's gonna eat
your bodies alive.

99
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:19,679
You've got to be kidding.

100
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:21,842
We're not some kind of shellfish!

101
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,283
I'd say you're pretty much
the same thing.

102
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:27,781
You guys, that's not
all there is to it.

103
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:30,156
How about the part about
coming in the mouth?

104
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,958
What are you talking about, Geri?!
How could I forget that!

105
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:36,561
In the mouth?!

106
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,157
What are you scheming?!

107
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:42,465
Listen, first you lick this here.

108
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:45,440
Then you take it in the mouth
and suckle on it.

109
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:48,102
Then you move it up and down,
side to side...

110
00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:50,908
...until your jaw seizes up.

111
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:55,349
Then you take what comes
and swallow it all.

112
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:56,077
What...?!

113
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,585
Fellatio...!

114
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:59,018
How could they...!

115
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,178
No way!

116
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,022
Don't you get uppity with me!

117
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:04,519
What about you?!

118
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:07,825
It's your misfortune that
you came after us.

119
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,060
That's the spirit, Meruru!

120
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,727
Teach them that people aren't
who they seem at first.

121
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:14,235
Awaken!

122
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:17,034
The wise redeemers
of darkness and fury.

123
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:21,243
There's no green far and near.
May our fertility sustain us.

124
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:24,837
Deliver us from this ugliness
as our hearts deserve.

125
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:27,349
Evoke Tella and Teneble!

126
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:29,043
Metamol Fas!

127
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,714
What?!

128
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:40,088
It's because I don't have
my Charles Rod!

129
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:43,528
And my parchment was washed
away in the river.

130
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:46,364
Even without my Rod...!

131
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,695
Grant me, the miracle
of metamorphosis.

132
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:53,038
I shall then wield a spider web.

133
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:57,239
I shall dance, floating on the air,
and capture you in my web!

134
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,549
Evoke Tella and Vintos!

135
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,380
Magic Web!

136
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:07,918
Oh, no! Meruru!

137
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:13,022
They're nothing more than
mummies wrapped in bandages!

138
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,257
They sure fell into a hole this time.

139
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:17,060
No!

140
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:19,533
Well.

141
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:27,040
No...!

142
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,083
Get that ass up in the air!

143
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:36,883
No...

144
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:40,387
Freni!

145
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:44,552
Shut up! I'll do you in a minute.
Just sit tight and watch!

146
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:55,633
Here we go!

147
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,039
No!

148
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,406
Hey, Geri! Let us have a go at her!

149
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:09,274
Let me just finish up here.

150
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:15,110
Freni!

151
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,586
Oh, yeah! I'm gettin' pretty horny!

152
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:44,280
I'm about to come!

153
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:58,526
Now, it's your turn.

154
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,491
All right!

155
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,392
No...!

156
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,682
How about we give this one
a little bit of love?

157
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:22,944
All right, it's your turn.

158
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:24,944
Yeah!

159
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:02,304
No...!

160
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,411
What are you talking about?

161
00:22:04,514 --> 00:22:06,812
It's only just beginning.

162
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:10,080
Please stop! Stop it!

163
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,923
Now, suck it! Suck it!

164
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:53,858
You idiot! Don't spit it out!

165
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,599
What's that look for?

166
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:06,764
All right, you swallow too! There!

167
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,708
My turn! My turn!

168
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:21,317
And you too!

169
00:23:24,294 --> 00:23:27,127
Let it all out. All of it!

170
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,946
Now, we're gonna rip your arm
and leg tendons apart.

171
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,481
And then it's over.

172
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:20,245
Metamol Fas!

173
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,850
This must be...!

174
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,953
They must be down there somewhere.

175
00:24:32,963 --> 00:24:34,123
Oh, Meruru...

176
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:36,062
You are already aware.

177
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:40,569
The thunderbolt that destroyed the
man-eating ogre, and this spell.

178
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,968
As long as sorcery lives in the Rod.

179
00:24:43,073 --> 00:24:47,100
In other words, the secret effect
of the Spell Enhancer.

180
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,043
You know that it is not
your own power.

181
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:52,080
My Rod is there to save you.

182
00:24:52,182 --> 00:24:55,777
However, Meruru, if you have the
will, you must carry on your quest.

183
00:24:55,886 --> 00:24:57,979
To the deep bosom of your master.

184
00:25:46,636 --> 00:25:47,660
We're saved.

185
00:25:47,771 --> 00:25:50,797
But eggs have been laid inside us.

186
00:25:50,907 --> 00:25:54,707
It's okay. I have a potion
that my master gave me.

187
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:55,937
If we take that...

188
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:57,607
Really?!

189
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:56,016
Hear me. Hear my voice.

190
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:57,684
And answer me.

191
00:28:57,794 --> 00:29:02,493
Cloaked in red and a banner of
blue like the beasts of fury...

192
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:05,799
...commanding great power,
bringing good fortune upon thee...

193
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:07,893
...but then only to take it away.

194
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:12,998
Broadening the power deep within,
the ones which bring to focus.

195
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:15,611
Thou great power of
meritorious deeds.

196
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,543
The glory of thee and
your supreme valor.

197
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:21,174
Bring to me once again that which
was fulfilled in the past.

198
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:22,744
Grant me the power!

199
00:29:22,852 --> 00:29:25,650
In this moment in which
I possess the wisdom...

200
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:30,419
...thou shall strike down the
repugnant and soulless scourge.

201
00:29:30,927 --> 00:29:33,225
To the spirits of Ignis
and Framma...

202
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:34,557
...I need your power.

203
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:38,100
Gather forth in this place, and
show me your supreme valor.

204
00:29:38,201 --> 00:29:40,101
Let me be your sword!

205
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:45,932
Evoke Ignis Fireball!
