1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:13,080
Magical Twilight

2
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,930
This is impossible!

3
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,720
Who'd have thought such a hot
little number would come on to me!

4
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,450
I can't take it!

5
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,690
Please pass your papers
to the student behind you.

6
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,750
All those who have turned in your papers may leave.

7
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,260
Those having to take the practical exam, it will begin in one hour.

8
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,860
You will all be notified of the results of your test.

9
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,950
We'll take a break until then.

10
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,220
So, teacher, how about doing something
about my written exam scores?

11
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,600
Are you crazy? I cant't do anyone a favor like that!

12
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,340
It would have helped if you had taken the damn test!

13
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,070
Besides, you seduced me!

14
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,580
Quit whining! Even human school girls have a price.

15
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,190
And you're smart enough to know, nothing's free!

16
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,710
So don't go thinking your're getting
off with any freebies from me!

17
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,220
Come on. I'm sure you could do something.

18
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,374
It would be so sad if I had
to tell the Great Principal.

19
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,512
Expulsion from the Magical World
is so extreme!

20
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,750
You had this whole thing planned!

21
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,670
What a bitch!

22
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,830
Thanks for everything, teacher.

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,270
I'll be counting on you!

24
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,730
Chipple! How'd it go?

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,100
Your third Graduation Exam?

26
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,460
It'll be a major miracle if I pass!

27
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,130
Chipple... Wait!

28
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,580
Have you seen Irene?

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,470
She was supposed to take her exam today
too, but we haven't seen her all morning...

30
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,360
I wonder what could have happened to her?
I don't see how she could have forgotten...

31
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,740
I really don't care!

32
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,260
How can you say that? Hasn't she been
your best friend since you were little?

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,780
No, she wasn't, not ever! Our houses
were just close together that's all!

34
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,790
Why are you so angry?

35
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,130
Because I

36
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,810
HATE IRENE!

37
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,140
But why? Irene is such a nice girl!

38
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,650
That's right and she's so sweet and generous!

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,900
Right!

40
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,110
Boy, has she got you fooled! She's as sweet
and innocent as the cat who ate the canary!

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,320
You wouldn't belive the things she's
tried to do with me when we were alone!

42
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,100
Just because she's stronger and more powerful,
she thinks she can get away with murder!

43
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,620
She's a two-faced pussy!

44
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,490
Meow.

45
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,540
Hi, Chipple!

46
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,020
What's that about a pussy?

47
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,040
Irene!

48
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,130
My stomach...

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,570
Are you alright, Chipple?

50
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,240
I'm okay. It's okay. Don't worry.

51
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,140
I'll just go see the nurse...

52
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,820
Take me out of the path of danger...

53
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,710
The Great Principal bids
the next examinee to enter.

54
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,650
Yes sir!

55
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:30,830
Student number 15,103.
Ellington, Chipple.

56
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,640
Yes sir.

57
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,780
You have failed to achieve a passing
grade on your written examination.

58
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,400
Yes sir.

59
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,170
Do you want to give up now?
Or will you take the practical exam?

60
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,040
Of course I'll take it!

61
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,640
This is the third time I've
taken that exam this year...

62
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,600
I really, really want to graduate this time.

63
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,570
My only dream is of becoming a good witch!

64
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,770
Yes, you've certainly been among
our most willing students...

65
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,250
You may not be aware that I personally grade
all performances on the practical exams

66
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,400
even if you failed the written portion

67
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,100
on my grading curve it's still
possible for you to graduate.

68
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,040
Simply do the best you're capable of.

69
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,280
Yes sir!

70
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,060
Now, about the exam. First, you must
go down to the surface.

71
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,310
To the surface?
To the Human world?

72
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,890
To the surface!

73
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,410
Alright! I'm going to do everything
I can to pass the test!

74
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,620
At last, I'm here!

75
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,140
Beautiful!

76
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,490
Chipple!

77
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,060
Chipple, you were flying like a
runaway express train!

78
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,750
Irene! What are you doing here?

79
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,420
I've got the same assignment for my
practical exam as you do, Chipple.

80
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,190
He said that we had to do it together.

81
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,930
Just how can you be taking the practical
exam without taking the written exam first?

82
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,520
Oh, I took it orally.

83
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,850
My written essays were
in body language.

84
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,640
I should have known.

85
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,560
Oh, by the way, could you tell me
the details of our assignment?

86
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,430
What? You mean nobody told you?

87
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,860
I thought I could get
what I needed from you.

88
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,550
I can't belive how pathetic you are!

89
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,920
Alright, I'll tell you just once.

90
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,560
We've been assigned to move
into a human household.

91
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,750
We must strive to make a good
impression on our test subject.

92
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,510
if the subject's impression is
favorable enough, we pass the exam.

93
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,920
And who's our human target?

94
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,540
Tachibana Tsukasa

95
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,850
He's a 19 year old student,
currently preparing for college.
That's all the information I have.

96
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,770
I hope he's not too ugly.

97
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,070
Why must you be like this?

98
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,310
He's the only test subject we've got!

99
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,750
Well, these are the details! Bye!

100
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,670
Hey! Wait for me!

101
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,710
Please... stop...!

102
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,940
Another dream about being killed...

103
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,970
Excuse me, please?

104
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,180
Yes?

105
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,610
Good morning!

106
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,680
Hello, we're two apprentice witches
from the world of White Magic.

107
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,420
Witches?

108
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,210
That's right.

109
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,210
I'm not interested!

110
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,020
Crap! He's got some nerve, brushing
me off from behind a door like that!

111
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,410
Uh, Irene...

112
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,150
You're just a lousy human!

113
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,180
I won't forgive you!

114
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,230
You idiot!

115
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
I think you went too far, doing that.

116
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,370
He asked for it.

117
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,090
Well, I guess we've lost a few points.

118
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,130
This is all your fault!

119
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,580
What's going on?

120
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,020
Is it still morning? What happened?

121
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,870
Hey dude, what are you doing here so early?

122
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,490
You look like shit.

123
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,580
This crazy girl forced her way into my house
and wouldn't let me go back to sleep.

124
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,450
Oh yeah? And since when have you
been going out with this chick?

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,630
It's not like that.

126
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,520
These two girls just showed up this morning.

127
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,710
What? Two girls? You lucky son of a bitch!

128
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,680
You don't understand, they're both witches!

129
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,270
Huh?

130
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,850
Pretty funny! That's a good one, Tachibana!

131
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,850
I've been thinking...

132
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:50,410
these awful dreams I've been having.
Maybe they're connected somehow to those two.

133
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,400
Hmm, you're pretty sharp!

134
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,620
Huh? What the hell?

135
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,610
You've got to be jokeing...

136
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,430
Jokes aren't my style

137
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,450
Where the hell did she come from?

138
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,470
What is it?

139
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,170
That's her! The girl who
comes to me in my dreams.

140
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,900
You're not here to kill me, are you?

141
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:19,740
Bingo! I sent those dreams to psych
you up for your impending death!

142
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,560
Yo! Yo! Babe, Where are you from?
What's your name?

143
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,240
My name is Liv, a witch from
the Black Magic World.

144
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,420
Another witch!

145
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,850
Of course, I'm not really a full fledged
witch. I still have to pass one last test.

146
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,000
That's right. Those other two were
saying something about that.

147
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,560
I see, so that makes this chick
witch number three, right?

148
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,730
Number three?

149
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,260
In any case...

150
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,680
Why are you so set on killing me?

151
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,110
Because killing you is the practical
portion of my final exam, of course.

152
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,540
Noway!

153
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,080
Well, I'm going to let you go this time.
Besides, it looks like I've got something
else to take care of.

154
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,960
Tachibane, I don't know what's going
on, but I'll bet it gets pretty interesting!

155
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,330
I'm going to die!
This is no time to make jokes!

156
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,990
She's cute.

157
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,050
No, no. This is the old "a girl looks
best working in the kitchen" trick.

158
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,700
What's wrong?

159
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,800
What the hell is going on here?

160
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,160
A witch is trying to kill me, and you idiots
show up in my apartment and ask what's wrong?

161
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,160
Kill you?

162
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,610
Your friend showed up at school
and told me all about it!

163
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,640
She said that killing me
was part of her final exam!

164
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,930
Damnit! I've got my own test to take
and if I fail it'll be my third time!

165
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,260
Get out of here! Both of you!
This is my house!

166
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,920
There's no need to be so rude
about it, you know!

167
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,080
What?

168
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:02,070
I've got an exam to pass, too!
Stop thinking of no one but yourself!

169
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,500
You brainless bimbo! Why should I
give a damn about your problems?

170
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,810
That does it, I've had it with you!

171
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,890
What the hell are you doing?!

172
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,270
So, there are White Magic students
taking exams here too.

173
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,210
You really did have a rough night, didn't you?

174
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,770
So, how did you get rid of those two?

175
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,520
Oh, that was the easy part.

176
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,930
If I don't have any favorable impressions
of them, they'll fail their final exams.

177
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,510
Scaring them away was as easy as
telling them what kind of grade
they'd get if they didn't leave!

178
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,940
I see, but don't you miss them?

179
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,810
It's not healthy for you to eat
the same thing everyday.

180
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,250
Please, try this. I made it just for you.

181
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,630
Leave me alone!

182
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,980
Tsukasa-kun, please listen to me.

183
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,150
Shut up! I told you not to come here!

184
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,020
Tsukasa-kun, I... I've failed
this exam three times already.

185
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,690
That might not be the only reason but I feel

186
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,770
I do understand how you're feeling right now.

187
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,720
I just wanted to see if I could
cheer you up a little... that's all.

188
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,610
That's all I wanted to say, please eat well.

189
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,240
Bye!

190
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,690
Wait up!

191
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,010
You're... Chipple, right?

192
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,900
You can call me Chipple. And...?

193
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,100
That food of yours...

194
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,160
Yes?

195
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,350
Since you already brought it...

196
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:54,980
Yes?

197
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,950
Let's eat it together!

198
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,720
This one and that one.
That one is really good.

199
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,290
This one?

200
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,410
Yes, it's very good.

201
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,410
Let's see...

202
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,730
And...?

203
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,550
Yes! Delicious!

204
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,490
I knew you'd like it!

205
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,060
That's great!

206
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,870
What did you want to talk about?

207
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,218
That you're a little sneak!

208
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:29,466
I can't believe you pulled that sorry
"Home Cooking" stunt on me!

209
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,170
That was never my intention!

210
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,940
Forget it! But remember this!

211
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,290
From now on I'm going
to do things my way!

212
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,300
You mean you're going to stoop
to your usual dirty tricks!

213
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,501
You got it!

214
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:46,054
And if I don't work quickly, that Black
Magic witch is likely to kill Tachibana.

215
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,350
I mean to have my way with him
before she finishes him off!

216
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,390
That's your karma, I guess.

217
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,350
Why's she so set on
killing Tsukasa, anyway?

218
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,190
You really don't know?

219
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,856
In order to receive a Black Magic License...

220
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,475
...a student has to kill a human
to pass the practical exam.

221
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,780
I see. They're a little more extreme
than us White Magic users, aren't they?

222
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,753
Ah! But that means we can't
ever leave him alone!

223
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:10,422
Not with that Black Magic
student out to get him.

224
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,900
You mean that one?

225
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,580
That's her!

226
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,820
Shes's heading towards his apartment!

227
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,070
I'm not letting her get away with this!

228
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,430
Hey, I'm not going to
let you sneak off again!

229
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,030
Oh... Chipple... I...

230
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,360
Your happy dream ends right here!

231
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,800
I'm here to turn your worst
nightmare into reality, as promised!

232
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,600
You again!!!

233
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,048
I won't hold you to that promise!

234
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:55,817
You really didn't have to get up so
early to ruin my Sunday, did you?

235
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:58,400
"Good deeds should be done
quickly, without hesitation!"

236
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,440
Good deed? You're trying to kill me!

237
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,419
Which is a very good thing, from
a Black Magic point of view.

238
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,088
Now, prepare to die...

239
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,410
No! Stop!

240
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,510
Die!

241
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,660
Don't get too far ahead of yourself!

242
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,760
Chipple!

243
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,290
You must be one of those children
from the White Magic World.

244
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,170
If you make any attempt
to harm Tsukasa-kun

245
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,040
you'll have to answer to me!

246
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,530
Chipple.

247
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,230
Alright, if that's the way things are,
I'll eliminate you as well.

248
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,410
I might even accure bonus points
on the exam for taking you out!

249
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,800
What'll I do? My magic's
not even as powerful as Irene's...

250
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,950
Here!

251
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,730
Chipple!

252
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,040
I'll make you forget about Chipple.

253
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,020
How is it? Are you cuming?

254
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,870
Chipple!

255
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,390
Tsukasa-kun!

256
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,280
Hmm! Should I kill you both at once?

257
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,210
Get out of here! Chipple! Hurry!

258
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,640
Tsukasa-kun!

259
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,380
What can I do?
I don't have the power to beat her!

260
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,250
Go on! Get out of here now!

261
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,460
I'm going to hurt you, slowly but surely.

262
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,150
Chipple! Hurry!

263
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,010
Tsukasa-kun!

264
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,260
This is quite unexpected!

265
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,860
I never would have believed that such a powerful
witch could exist in the White Magic World.

266
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,220
But, the next time we meet,
it will be I who prevail!

267
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,390
Prepare yourself!

268
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,240
That means she's going to try
and kill me again, doesn't it?

269
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,250
Hey you!

270
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,830
Hey, you're that witch chick, aren't you?
Decided to give me your phone number yet?

271
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,780
Are you crazy? Is your friend
Tachibana here today?

272
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,290
Well now, I don't think
I've seen him around...

273
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,800
Is he out someplace with
that White Witch bitch?

274
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,200
So, I can't do anything about him yet.

275
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,010
Yo! Yo!

276
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,830
You can do something
with me, though!

277
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,030
I don't have any business with you.

278
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,290
Hey! It's Tachibana!

279
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,750
Where?

280
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,520
I've got a lot of business
to do with you, witch!

281
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,920
What's going on???

282
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,440
Don't worry, this is the school nurse's office,
and I made sure no one else can get in.

283
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,220
You bastard! Do you really think you can
get away with doing this to a witch?!

284
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,780
Strangely enough, it's not against
the law to do anything to a witch.

285
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,670
That's not my point!

286
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,140
What point would you like to make?

287
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,480
Stop it! Don't touch me!

288
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,220
Sorry, I've got to teach you something
that's a lot more fun than killing people!

289
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,340
Stop...

290
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,360
What's so urgent all of the sudden?

291
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,740
I've made up my mind!

292
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,830
About what?

293
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,200
Just stay here, and make sure
you lock the door!

294
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,190
Now I understand! Chipple's going to...

295
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,610
Chipple!

296
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,750
I'll make you forget all about that
goody-two-shoes Chipple!

297
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,470
Shall we pick up where we left off?

298
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,690
I can't move!

299
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,930
I can feel her presence. Somewhere nearby,
is a Witch of the Black Magic World.

300
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,570
She's in there.
The witch is in there!

301
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,510
If I can't take out this Black
Magic user, Tsukasa-kun will die!

302
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,430
I may not survive, but this is for him.
I will protect Tsukasa-kun!

303
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,330
Hey, babe! What's shakin'?

304
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,530
I've decided not to kill Tachibana.

305
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,450
In fact, I've quit being a witch. I don't
want to be parted from this man of mine!

306
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,270
So, you must be Chipple, right?

307
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,020
You heard what the lady said,
tell Tachibana that everything's cool.

308
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,110
Magical powers are one thing, but they
can't stand up to my magic wand!

309
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:02,120
This will definitely bring me up for graduation, yes!

310
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,200
Irene.

311
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,480
What the hell have you been doing?!

312
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,620
Chipple!

313
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,600
You used your magic to force him
to do this, didn't you?

314
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,960
Perhaps, but his body certainly
hasn't voiced any complaints!

315
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,970
I'm going to make
you very, very sorry!

316
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,410
Chipple, you don't really
think you can beat me?

317
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,110
That's unimportant! This is for Tsukasa-kun!

318
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,130
Don't be stupid! You know that falling
for a human's only a waste of time!

319
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,650
If I do this for Tsukasa-kun, it won't be a waste!

320
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,120
You're out of your mind!
I'll make you understand!

321
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,960
Come on!

322
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,690
Stop it!

323
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,220
Don't you lay a hand on Chipple!

324
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,120
If you're going to do
something, do it to me!

325
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,860
If you're going to do it, do it to me.

326
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,150
Tsukasa-kun!

327
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,060
Chipple...

328
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,880
I'm here.

329
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,280
What a bunch of crap!
I can't take anymore of this!

330
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,600
So... I won't be able to see you again?

331
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,980
We may not live in the same world, but...

332
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,160
I guess there are things no one can control.

333
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,770
This one time, it was real.

334
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,940
Our first time, our last time, together.

335
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,450
Good-bye, Tsukasa-kun!

336
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,570
That stuff's not very good for you...

337
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:01,390
It's unhealthy, eating that stuff everyday.

338
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,510
What?!

339
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:06,700
Here!

340
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,430
How is this possible?

341
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,630
I flunked.

342
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,700
You must go back to Tachibane's place
once more, and retrain yourself!

343
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,090
I'll phrase it like that anyway!

344
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,380
That's what he said!

345
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,940
That means...

346
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,710
I guess I'm going to be
a student forever!

347
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,040
Chipple!

348
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,650
From now on, I'm not going anywhere!
