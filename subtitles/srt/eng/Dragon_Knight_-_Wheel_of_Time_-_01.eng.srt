1
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,892
Long... Oh, so long ago.

2
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,588
So long ago that I can't\Nremember anymore...

3
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,690
I was in a war.

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,276
It seemed I had been in\Na war for a long time.

5
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,642
But against who? And why?

6
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,714
The war... I wonder what\Nhappened to it?

7
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,583
And why am I...

8
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,727
Why am I still alive?

9
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,210
There's no time to explain.

10
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,104
Marlene?

11
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,014
Come, put this on.

12
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,392
This was your most\Ncoveted possession.

13
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:12,396
If only... If only I had\Nlistened to you before.

14
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,170
To me?

15
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,374
{\kf900000}Kakeru, I beg you. Please do as I say.

16
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,841
Take this.

17
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,001
What is this?

18
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,810
Now, hold this stone\Nagainst your chest.

19
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:35,588
Please believe in me, and pray hard\Nso that your wish will be granted.

20
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,055
Wish what?

21
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:42,195
Kakeru, do you wish to remain here\Nand rot until the end of time?!

22
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:45,632
You must go back to the\Npast and persuade me.

23
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,968
Lucifon's powers can be\Ncountered if I am with you.

24
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,639
Go back to the past\Nand persuade you?

25
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,106
That's right.

26
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,777
I can go back?

27
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,244
Yes, you can.

28
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,782
But there is something\Nyou must never forget.

29
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:06,819
You must never allow your past\Nself to know who you really are.

30
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:07,649
Is that clear?

31
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,859
I don't quite get what you're saying.

32
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:17,125
Do not worry. As long as you\Nremember what I have said,

33
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,332
it will be fine.

34
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,130
But what about you, Marlene?

35
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,400
I can't leave you here alone.

36
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,471
As long as you have such\Nkindness in your heart,

37
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,013
you will overcome\NLucifon the next time.

38
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,380
Marlene, we'll run away\Ntogether! Okay!

39
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:45,080
Don't be alarmed. Once you change\Nthe past, I will no longer be here.

40
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,930
You must hurry.

41
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,330
Lucifon will be here in no time.

42
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,056
He will kill you.

43
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,000
If you should die,\Nit will mean the end.

44
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,899
Please pray.

45
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,606
Nothing's happening.

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,411
Kakeru, can you recall Natasha's end?

47
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,221
Kakeru!

48
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,588
Natasha! Grab my arm!

49
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,197
Do it, now!

50
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,040
I can't! My grip is so weak!

51
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,101
No! You have to force\Nyourself to grab on to me!

52
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,536
I can't! Kakeru, I just can't!

53
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,790
Kakeru, please let go. I don't\Nwant you to fall with me.

54
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:06,105
I don't care if I do fall down\Nwith you! So please, hold on to me!

55
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:10,443
Kakeru... You've done all you can.

56
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,910
I'm sorry...

57
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,520
Natasha!

58
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,337
Natasha's life is gone forever\Nunless you change the past.

59
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,671
I want to go back!

60
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,399
I want to go back to the past and\Nsave Natasha, keep her from harm.

61
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,314
I've got to save Natasha!

62
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,417
Yes, pray even harder.

63
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,589
To save her, you must\Ngo back in time.

64
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,457
You must go back! To the past!

65
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,657
I want to go to the past!

66
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,792
Yes, to the past.

67
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:13,536
To the past. To the past! I\Nhave to get back!

68
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:20,041
Now, I will return back to the past!

69
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,066
Forgive the sad state of my castle.

70
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,101
Alas, most have run off.

71
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,437
We are the few that\Nhave remained behind.

72
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:49,841
And so, you are the heir\Nto Sir Takeru the Brave?

73
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,343
Heir?

74
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,282
He is asking if you are Takeru's son.

75
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,786
Oh, yeah, sure. My name's Kakeru.

76
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,423
And he's Burn's son, Seil.

77
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,993
I ask you, then. Where are\NSir Takeru and Sir Burn?!

78
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,052
Well, they're at home!

79
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,256
That's why Seil and I came.

80
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:21,937
What shall we do?

81
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,200
Are you aware of the Black Mist\Nencroaching from the western skies?

82
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,181
The Black Mist?

83
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:33,252
Yes, anyone engulfed in the\Nmist is said to turn to stone.

84
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:37,712
What?! Then does that\Nmean... My dad is...

85
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:44,725
If Sir Burn is still in the town\Nof Sogya, then I'm afraid he too...

86
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,367
Oh, no!

87
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,669
The Black Mist was dispatched\Nby Lucifon, a man who appeared

88
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,673
in the far eastern\Nkingdom of Reimling.

89
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,442
Lucifon has employed\Nsorcery to deceive people,

90
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,045
compelling them to send\Ntheir armies against us.

91
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,105
There is word that even dragons\Nhave been dispatched against us.

92
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,751
Dragons! Ain't that cool, Seil?!

93
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,253
Yeah, sure...

94
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,288
{\kf900000}Wow, that's so awesome.\N{\kf900000}Wish I could see them!

95
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,823
Such idle talk!

96
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,257
When even Sir Takeru has\Nbeen turned to stone!

97
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,430
It was absolutely imperative\NSir Takeru the Brave

98
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,160
and Sir Burn rallied to our cause.

99
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:25,393
My daughter was being married\Ninto the Reimling royalty.

100
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:33,079
No matter now. The Black\NMist is almost upon us.

101
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,412
There is nothing we can do anymore.

102
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,851
Let them retire.

103
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,977
{\kf900000}Yes, Sire.

104
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,625
Kakeru, what should we do?

105
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,263
So that's the Black Mist.

106
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,738
Its color really is black!

107
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,002
Well, isn't that rather obvious?

108
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,848
I'm not sure I can make it\Nif I'm with you, Kakeru.

109
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,873
Kakeru! Kakeru!

110
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:17,213
What are you doing here?!\NWe need to run! Come!

111
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,659
Hurry, there's no time to waste!

112
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,160
Who are you, old man?

113
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,863
I am not an old man! You can\Ncall me older brother!

114
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,532
But there's no time for that! Just run!

115
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,935
Who does this geezer think he is?

116
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,098
There's no time! Just\Nhurry and run! Now!

117
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,636
Yeah, sure. Let's get\Nout of here while we can!

118
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,145
Just run! Everyone!\NRun toward the east!

119
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,045
Run! Run!

120
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,806
I can't go any further.

121
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,642
We'll be safe here for the moment.

122
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,310
So who are you, old man?

123
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,945
I am not an old man!

124
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,649
Enough of that, already.\NI'm asking your name.

125
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,253
Oh, I see. Yes, well, uh...

126
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:25,212
That's it! Eto! My name is Eto.

127
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,962
Our town...

128
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,429
Mommy!

129
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,460
Who would do such a...

130
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,201
Everyone listen to me!

131
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,398
Everybody, please hear\Nwhat I have to say!

132
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:47,002
We need to defeat that mist, and\Nrestore those turned to stone!

133
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:51,317
To do that, we need to defeat the\Nperson who unleashed that mist!

134
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,486
So you're talking about Lucifon?

135
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,953
That's right!

136
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:58,420
Lucifon is in the Reimling kingdom\Nlocated far to the east!

137
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:03,551
Just now, the forward forces of his\Narmies are just about to reach us.

138
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,090
So, we're between a rock and a\Nhard place if we do nothing.

139
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,232
We will embark upon a\Njourney to the east.

140
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,839
This will be a long journey where\Nwe aim to defeat Lucifon's armies

141
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,966
and take down Lucifon!

142
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,238
And here with us is Takeru\Nthe Brave's son, Kakeru,

143
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,979
and Burn the Dragon\NKnight's son, Seil!

144
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,246
They will come with us!

145
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,790
Come, those who boast\Ngreat skills in combat!

146
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,224
Champions of courage\Nand noble at heart!

147
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,757
Rally to our cause and\Njoin us in our odyssey!

148
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,298
Days of fighting begin yet again.

149
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,027
Though my view has changed,\Nthe fighting is familiar.

150
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,531
The same encounters repeated again.

151
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,174
The same unfortunate souls\Ndoomed to die once again.

152
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:02,550
But I have to change the course\Nof events, no matter what!

153
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,527
What? The Lucifon forces\Nare petty wimpy.

154
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:12,098
My, my heart, still going\Na mile a minute.

155
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,666
I'm so scared.

156
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,726
Don't let your guard down.\NWe've only just begun to fight.

157
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:21,335
Let's go! Let's make it\Nto the town before dusk.

158
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,044
Once we make it to the town,\Nrelax and get rested, everyone.

159
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,205
Make sure to grab something\Nto eat and tend your weapons.

160
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:54,540
I used to be held captive by the\NLucifon forces. Please let me join you!

161
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,842
Sure, no problem. Right, Eto?

162
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,344
Of course.

163
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,881
{\kf900000}I'm still a beginner sorceress,\N{\kf900000}but I'll work hard!

164
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,576
I won't forgive the Lucifon forces!

165
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,853
Forward march!

166
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,532
Heed my call, travelers!

167
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,501
I am the Knight Charon!

168
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:30,176
I found this woman collapsed\Non the road to Lavinnia,

169
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,634
but I am traveling to Lavinnia to\Nconfront the Lucifon forces there.

170
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,050
I ask that you take her\Nand tend to her care.

171
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,517
Natasha!

172
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,887
Seil, help Nereid!

173
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,389
Yeah, sure.

174
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,651
{\kf900000}Easy now, easy...

175
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,387
But what is Natasha doing here?

176
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,166
My type...

177
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,259
Natasha! Natasha!

178
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,334
Ka... Kakeru...

179
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,441
Kakeru!

180
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,243
Natasha...

181
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,710
Natasha!

182
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,672
Horrible...

183
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,661
{\kf900000}This is so awful...

184
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,311
She's alive! This lady's still alive!

185
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,572
Wow, she sure is a beautiful lady.

186
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:52,221
They were all murdered.

187
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:57,162
As a proud elfin tribe, we told\Nthem we would never join them.

188
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,598
You should save your strength.

189
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,897
Eto, let's get her\Nunder a roof somewhere.

190
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,633
Eto! What's the matter?

191
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,143
Oh, what did you say, Kakeru?

192
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,670
I said we should get her\Nto a safe place and rest.

193
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,514
Oh, yes...

194
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,884
Certainly, sounds good.

195
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,453
Eto, what's wrong?

196
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,512
Oh, nothing. I'll carry her.

197
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,956
Just as you pleaded with me to,

198
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,062
I've come back, Marlene.

199
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,680
I beg you. Please do not\Nleave me behind.

200
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,481
Please take me with you!

201
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,482
But...

202
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,786
{\kf900000}I know a thing or two about archery.

203
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,449
I will not let myself\Nbecome a burden to you.

204
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,125
Sure, okay.

205
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,592
Right, Eto?

206
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:08,131
In any case, with this rain, we\Nmight as well stay here to rest.

207
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,410
Natasha...

208
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:50,499
Huh? It's Natasha. You\Nsure are awake early.

209
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,344
Humph.

210
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,148
{\kf900000}Wow, is it like, you're seeing me off?

211
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,183
Oh, don't flatter yourself!

212
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,819
I was taking a stroll thinking\Nover things, and by coincidence...

213
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,388
This early in the morning?

214
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,855
Oh, be quiet!

215
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,594
I bet you're gonna feel\Nlonely when I'm gone.

216
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,290
That's not likely. Why should I?!

217
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:16,268
Yeah, I suppose so. You wouldn't\Nmiss me a bit, I guess.

218
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,135
Oh, I just wish you would go\Nfar way and never come back.

219
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,772
I'll finally be able to walk safely\Nwithout you messing with me.

220
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,140
You're right. I'm sorry, Natasha.

221
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,714
Well then, bye-bye, Natasha.

222
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,718
Bye-bye? Wait, Kakeru,\Nare you leaving already?

223
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,219
Yup!

224
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,454
{\kf900000}Kakeru! Kakeru!

225
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,921
I said wait!

226
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,554
Here, take this with you.

227
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,465
What's this?

228
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:50,169
I made this... cursed talisman!

229
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,703
A cursed talisman?

230
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,137
Yes, that's right.\NA cursed talisman!

231
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,774
What?

232
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:01,135
Thank you, I'll take it since you\Nwent through all the trouble.

233
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,274
Take care, Natasha!

234
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,451
Kakeru, you big jerk!

235
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:23,469
Kakeru... You've done all you can.

236
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,870
I'm sorry.

237
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,236
Natasha!

238
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,209
Yes, pray even harder.

239
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,337
To save her, you must\Ngo back in time.

240
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,597
Eto!

241
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,133
Hey!

242
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,807
There you are. Let's go!

243
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,002
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

244
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,115
Right, let's go!

245
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,840
Aeolus Blade!

246
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,412
Get set to take the fort!

247
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,192
Help me!

248
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,763
Help! Help me!

249
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,398
Who the hell are you?

250
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,300
No! Stop this!

251
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,461
I'm in the middle of something.

252
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,305
Why don't you take a hint?

253
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,806
Marlene!

254
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,932
{\kf900000}Yes, Sir.

255
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,680
Listen while you\Nstill have your ears.

256
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,749
We've defeated everyone\Nin your little group here.

257
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,410
What?!

258
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,885
Beat it! I don't have the time to\Nmess with small fish like you!

259
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,567
No, wait!

260
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,757
Who is it?

261
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,224
Well...

262
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:42,031
I was in such danger. I must\Nthank you for saving me.

263
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,534
No, I did nothing special.

264
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,979
Is there something else?

265
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,743
I, well...

266
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:11,396
It's all right. It'll be all right.

267
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,864
Claris...

268
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,834
The Lucifon forces... My\Ntwin sister, Claris, was...

269
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,336
Did they murder her?

270
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,600
{\kf900000}No, they took her away.

271
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,538
Then don't lose hope, Mayfair.

272
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:28,042
Everyone with us has lost a father, a\Nmother or siblings in this war.

273
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,218
We aim to defeat Lucifon so there\Nwon't be any more needless victims,

274
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,277
to put an end to the\Npeople's suffering.

275
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:39,421
Those separated from loved ones\Nmight still be rejoined with them.

276
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,182
So don't give up hope, and\Ncome along with us, Mayfair.

277
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,161
At the end of this journey,\Nwe will defeat him!

278
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,753
Eto...

279
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:39,279
So, Eto was comforting Mayfair.

280
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,950
Now I know what he\Nwas doing back then.

281
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,162
Perhaps this was also Eto's mission.

282
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,222
Not only to fight, but also to...

283
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,001
Eto, let me be on top...

284
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,715
Eto...

285
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,262
Eto...

286
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:33,135
Your face... Please let me\Nsee your face.

287
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,040
I can't.

288
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,077
I have a horrible scar upon it.

289
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,545
That wouldn't bother...

290
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,211
Eto! Eto!

291
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,061
Kakeru...

292
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,858
This time, you must defeat Lucifon.

293
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,835
You must persuade me.

294
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,078
Eto?

295
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:24,890
Mayfair...

296
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,391
Yes?

297
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,093
{\kf900000}I have something I have to ask you.

298
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,495
You're from the village\Nof Trianon, right?

299
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,631
Yes, that's right.

300
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:36,268
Is Marlene from Trianon?

301
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:42,207
Marlene? No, the first I saw her\Nwas when you came to save me.

302
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,274
I see.

303
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,245
Forget I asked that\Nquestion. All right?

304
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,550
Yes, Sir. I understand.

305
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,677
When will you be leaving today?

306
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:57,846
Well, right after the sun rises.

307
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,885
Then Eto, could we...

308
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,357
Once more?

309
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:21,275
To be continued

310
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:49,873
People who won't give\Nup on their dreams

311
00:26:51,610 --> 00:27:01,349
They all have a bright\Nglitter in their eyes

312
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:08,989
Together with you, someday I wish

313
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:20,160
We'll take off flying toward\Nrealizing our dreams

314
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:28,146
No matter how tough it\Nis, I'll be with you

315
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:35,754
So don't let things bother\Nyou, let me know everything

316
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:42,927
Between the two of us, we\Ncan share any suffering

317
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:50,301
Your wings shine\Nwith vivid radiance

318
00:27:50,301 --> 00:28:01,479
As they beat through the air,\Naiming into the sky, flying free

319
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:08,853
Anybody, as long as\Nthere's something precious

320
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:14,793
They hold dear to their heart

321
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:23,565
Then they'll always shine\Nthrough any day and time

322
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,226
{\kf900000}Next Episode

323
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,406
As Kakeru, my odyssey was so simple.

324
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,209
I slew my enemies before me. That\Nwas all.

325
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,178
But now, I cannot allow\Nmyself to be defeated.

326
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,648
I don't want any of my friends to die.

327
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,617
Nor can I lose Marlene again.

328
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:17,145
However, this newcomer female knight\Nkeeps trying to provoke me.

329
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,722
Damn spitfire.

330
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:25,191
Next Dragon Knight: Princess!
