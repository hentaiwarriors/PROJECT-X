1
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,650
Mr. Ichiro, I'm here to
pick up the item we ordered.

2
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,760
Just a moment.

3
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,370
I'm just making the final adjustments now.

4
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,070
Did you bring the materials I requested?

5
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,140
Oh, sure. Don't worry. I brought that for you.

6
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,050
But it was a little unreasonable
to ask me to get materials...

7
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,250
...that are not approved in the market yet.

8
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,220
Unreasonable business
is your specialty, isn't it?

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,020
Well, that's true.

10
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,010
Let's see... the color of her eyes
is supposed to be purple.

11
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,680
Perfect!

12
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,440
Locked in.

13
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,950
The last thing I have to do is
synchronize her voice and personality.

14
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,510
As always, this is great work!

15
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,380
I'm sure my boss will be very
satisfied with the product.

16
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,550
The payment will be the same as usual.

17
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,420
The next pick up will be 2 months
from today, at the same time.

18
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,390
Okay.

19
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,490
Until then...

20
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,400
Two months from now...

21
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,770
No, no!

22
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,490
This isn't what I want! Damn it.

23
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,670
Almost there...

24
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,260
I can create the finest woman
in the world by using this...

25
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,250
...new material and the data
I used to create other androids.

26
00:03:48,100 --> 00:04:01,530
IMMA YOUJO

27
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,490
Sir.

28
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you for being so patient.

29
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,830
Yes! I'll do my best!

30
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,570
I'm sure you will.

31
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,120
Just like ants gathering for honey.

32
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,630
That why I can't quit this business.

33
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,630
Besides, our technology is on the cutting edge.

34
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,870
All the other play spots like us...

35
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,020
...are providing the jack-in type androids...

36
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,130
...and you can play anyway you want, but...

37
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,580
<i>Can I have your ID number?</i>

38
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,270
OMEKO 191969.

39
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,410
Loading the data.

40
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,850
Loading completed.

41
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,550
Enjoy your play.

42
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,530
Oh! Where have you been?

43
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,760
I was waiting for you all this time.

44
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,600
All the other places are doing
exactly same thing up to this point.

45
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,870
Yes. Up to this point... but...

46
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,780
Now you see the difference between
our Sodom and the other places.

47
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,100
Our androids have so many more
erogenous zones than regular androids.

48
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,800
You can get more sexual pleasure
from them than with real women.

49
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,880
And this is the best part of
our cutting edge technology.

50
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,560
Our androids can send feedback...

51
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,310
...of a woman's unlimited sexual
pleasure to the man's brain.

52
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,020
He can experience the same pleasures
that the android is having.

53
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,600
And the pleasure will feedback
into the android again.

54
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,640
Then it is doubled it and sent back
to stimulate the man's brain again.

55
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,080
This will repeatedly continue until they finish.

56
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Has sex ever been this good?

57
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,860
Ichiro, the man who made this, is a genius.

58
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,960
This is good.

59
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,010
Don't blame me, Mr. Matsuyama.

60
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,120
Damn it!

61
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,890
Ichiro, you bastard!

62
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,700
Hey! What are you waiting for?
Go and get that asshole! Hurry!

63
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,090
I did it. Finally!

64
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,360
What's wrong with you? Be quiet.

65
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,770
Wait!

66
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,410
Hurry up!

67
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,220
<i>Ma... ya...?</i>

68
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,450
<i>Yes. Your name is Maya.</i>

69
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,620
<i>And my name is Ichiro.
Nice to meet you, Maya.</i>

70
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,950
<i>Ichiro...</i>

71
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,660
Ichiro... Ichiro...

72
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,470
Ichir-

73
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,440
Maya, what are you hiding?

74
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,070
What? I don't know what
you are talking about.

75
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,440
Maya!

76
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,740
Let me see.

77
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,180
Too bad, Ichiro.

78
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,090
I knew it!

79
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,950
Hey!

80
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,880
Wait! Hey! Let me see it!

81
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,490
Have you seen him around here?

82
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,470
Hmm... I haven't seen him.

83
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,490
Really?

84
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,700
Should you see him, please give me a call.

85
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,200
There's some money in it for you, if you do...

86
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,020
Maya! Where are you?

87
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,520
Oh, Maya, there you are.

88
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,750
Ichiro...

89
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,320
What's the matter?

90
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,360
You're up here by yourself.

91
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,930
I was looking at the stars.

92
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,690
I see... but, it's time to go inside.

93
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,030
You'll get cold out here.

94
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,970
No, I'm all right.

95
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,700
I feel like... My heart feels hot.

96
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,880
What? Where are you feeling hot?

97
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,810
Maybe something is wrong with your coolant...

98
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,750
No, it's not that.

99
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,050
Then, it might be some kind of an overload.

100
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,540
No, that's not it!

101
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,780
Maya!

102
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,590
The reason my heart is warm is...

103
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,220
...because I like you.

104
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,860
I like you, Ichiro, because
you are always sweet to me.

105
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,160
What do you think of me, Ichiro?

106
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,300
W- Well, I...

107
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:18,870
I know that nobody seriously cares
about androids. But... I... I...

108
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,540
I like you, too.

109
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,510
I put all my thoughts into creating you.

110
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,420
But, I only input the basic data.

111
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,720
I wanted to give you a birth
and life like a real woman.

112
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,090
Even if that meant you may
not fall in love with me...

113
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,630
Even if you loved another man...

114
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,930
No matter what, I've decided to
protect you all through my life.

115
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,240
Maya, you are not an android.

116
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,470
You are the only woman that I love.

117
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,870
Ichiro...

118
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,710
I love you, Maya.

119
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,280
Please be gentle...

120
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,500
You look beautiful. Very beautiful... Maya...

121
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,000
Please don't look at me so much.

122
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,940
It may hurt at first. Is it all right?

123
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,240
Yes. It's alright... I can take it.

124
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,240
Here we go.

125
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,120
I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

126
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,020
No, I'm all right. Please continue.

127
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,680
It's beautiful.

128
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,620
Do you want to take a look?

129
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,690
That's okay. Let's go.

130
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,820
Hey, what's wrong?

131
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,330
We can't officially marry,

132
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,600
but we can have a wedding
at home, by ourselves.

133
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,400
Now, let's go inside and
try that dress on for you.

134
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,640
Ichiro!

135
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,460
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

136
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,270
Sorry, but we want to be alone tonight.

137
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,670
Don't leak your oil, and
stay outside to guard us.

138
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,580
Let's see... what else do we need.

139
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,410
Ichiro.

140
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,590
You look wonderful, Maya.

141
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,590
Thank you. You look great too, Ichiro.

142
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,830
Huh? Where's Mac?

143
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,260
What? I saw him around just a second ago.

144
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,160
He must have gone out for a walk.

145
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,100
You're so beautiful, Maya.

146
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,940
Thank you, Ichiro.

147
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,910
I will treasure this always.

148
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,510
Then, let's pledge our eternal love with a kiss.

149
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,240
W- Who are you guys?!

150
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,240
I've been looking for you.

151
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,880
Matsuyama? Why?!

152
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,150
You of all people should know why.

153
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,980
Maya! Get out of here!

154
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,190
Ichiro!

155
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,000
Get out of my home!

156
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,590
It's foolish to go against an
expert criminal such as myself.

157
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,550
You're supposed to be a genius.
That's not like you.

158
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,960
Well, now I understand the reason.

159
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,560
It's true that a woman will
make a man do crazy things.

160
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,370
Stop it. Don't do anything to Maya.

161
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,300
Shut up!

162
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,540
Still, I never thought you would
have ran away with a woman.

163
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,480
If I knew that, I would have
found you much earlier.

164
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,150
You have very nice taste in women.

165
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,330
Cordless... and using that new material.

166
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,770
This must be your new product line, isn't it?

167
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,730
No! Maya is human. She's not android!

168
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,300
Well then, let's test drive
your new product here...

169
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,080
Ms. Android Bride...

170
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,510
I beg you! Don't! I will do anything for you.

171
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,840
Please don't touch Maya! Please!

172
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,110
Ichiro!

173
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,440
Maya!

174
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,020
Is this the feel of the new material?

175
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,180
Very smooth.

176
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,000
Ichiro, help me!

177
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,870
Stop it! All of you!

178
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,940
This is great!

179
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,710
It's getting wet even though it
isn't connected to the AC cord.

180
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,550
This really turns me on.

181
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,400
Your skin is very smooth.

182
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,130
But how does it taste?

183
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,800
Very warm and tight.

184
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,680
My fingers can go deep inside.

185
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,940
I will test how it works here.

186
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,290
Here! Open your mouth.

187
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,650
Yes, that's good.

188
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,130
It's time to taste it.

189
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,270
Here, here, here.

190
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,380
Stop it! Please!

191
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,810
Stop...

192
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,850
Oh! It's squeezing me!

193
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,980
No other android can do these kinds of things!

194
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,950
I can't wait any longer! I'm going to cum!

195
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,450
Me too... I'm gonna cum any minute now!

196
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,370
Wonderful... Wonderful!

197
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,860
This is a masterpiece. Totally
different from the other androids.

198
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,460
This can be sold for a very high price!

199
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,360
Maya...

200
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,910
Do you know what this is?

201
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,880
That's...!

202
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,810
Yes, this is the special vibrator
you made to erase all the data...

203
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,420
...without having to cut open the android's body.

204
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,020
Please, don't do it! Please.

205
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,230
Don't worry, Ichiro... I... won't forget.

206
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:59,470
How can I so easily forget the days
I spent with you for the past year?

207
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,410
Isn't that right, Ichiro?

208
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,840
Maya...

209
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:12,720
But, if I do lose my memory, please destroy me...

210
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,390
...because then, I'm not Maya anymore...

211
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,190
Please, Ichiro.

212
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,000
The test drive is over.

213
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,340
Let's do the final maintenance
before we give this to our client.

214
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,370
Stop it!

215
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,180
Maya!

216
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,190
Maya!

217
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,770
Maya!

218
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,000
Maya!

219
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,160
It's been very successful.

220
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,630
It took only a week for that android to become...

221
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,620
...the most popular girl in this place.

222
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,600
Yes.

223
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,370
We made all the other androids cordless
as well, but still, Maya is different.

224
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,840
Matsuyama, when did you start
to call androids by their name?

225
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,140
W- Well...

226
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,680
It's alright... By the way, what
happened to that man, Ichiro?

227
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,290
Maya...

228
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,020
I took him back, but...
Maya...

229
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,420
I took him back, but...

230
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,320
Maya...

231
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:55,530
He isn't useful to us anymore.

232
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,930
He isn't useful to us anymore.
Maya...

233
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,120
He isn't useful to us anymore.

234
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,060
No? What a waste.

235
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,020
W- What? What is this?

236
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,090
No!

237
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,340
Don't look at me! Please!

238
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,270
Maya... as I promised you...
I will destroy you now...

239
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,250
Damn it!

240
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,760
Isozaki, that dirty old man...

241
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,760
Using his power for his own pleasure.

242
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,230
Does he want to buy that android?

243
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,900
It can't be... He wants Maya?

244
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,800
That's right. He likes Maya.

245
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:52,070
Maya is making ten times more
profit than the other androids.

246
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,610
Why would you sell her?

247
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,740
I know that.

248
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,550
But it's not a smart idea...

249
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,380
...to make the Isozaki conglomerate
unhappy in this town.

250
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,390
Yes, but...

251
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,910
Shut up! I've already decided.

252
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,010
Bring Maya here now!

253
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,620
Yes sir.

254
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,400
That android, Maya is a dangerous girl.

255
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:19,560
We aren't the ones who made her like this.

256
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,870
Cordless, new material...

257
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,710
We remodeled all the other androids like her,

258
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,840
but not one became like Maya.

259
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,510
All the men who play with Maya
start getting crazy for her.

260
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,340
They can't stop playing with her.

261
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:39,120
It's because we couldn't completely
erase Maya's memory of Ichiro.

262
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,160
Maya does anything with any customer,

263
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,790
but her mind is always with another man.

264
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,870
It must be a great pleasure raping
a woman who belongs to another man.

265
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,740
Men became crazy, one after another...

266
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,810
...when they see her eyes.

267
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,290
Maya.

268
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,520
Ichi...

269
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,530
Maya?!

270
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,160
What's the matter with you?

271
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,710
Are you all right?

272
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,410
I... I can't remember... What is this...?

273
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,380
Maya.

274
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,180
<i>Yes. Your name is Maya.</i>

275
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,980
Boss. I brought Maya.

276
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,020
A driver from the Isozaki
Conglomerate will be here soon...

277
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:23,790
Before that, Maya, sit down on the desk.

278
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:25,990
Yes...

279
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,370
Pull up your skirt, and open your legs wide.

280
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,710
Yes...

281
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,010
Good...

282
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,620
This made us a lot of money, but we
have to say goodbye, as of today.

283
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,160
Well, you don't have to worry about anything.

284
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,170
Chairman Isozaki will take
very good care of you.

285
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,570
Now, before you leave here,
let's make you forget about Sodom.

286
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,680
No!

287
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,960
I'm the new owner.
I won't give Maya to anybody.

288
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,060
Who is it!?

289
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,800
You two!

290
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,410
I don't care who will become the owner.

291
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,280
I only care to take that android.

292
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,820
I don't think you are a fool.

293
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,020
Think well about which is a smarter idea...

294
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,250
Whether you become an enemy or a
friend of the Isozaki Conglomerate.

295
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,090
I get it...

296
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,360
I'm sure this will make
Chairman Isozaki very happy.

297
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,040
Well then, goodbye new owner.

298
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,180
Maya.

299
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:44,990
Maya...

300
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,700
Maya!

301
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,970
Huh? Ichi...

302
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,540
What's wrong?

303
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,190
Does the android have a headache?

304
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,480
I see...

305
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:10,460
I'll help to make you feel better.
Here, lay down and relax.

306
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,440
You are so beautiful.

307
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,920
I've wanted you, ever since I saw you playing.

308
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,320
This is our last chance.

309
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,620
Let's enjoy ourselves until we
arrive at the Chairman's place.

310
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,750
Here, lick it.

311
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,570
This is so good! You are doing great.

312
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,040
Now rub my pussy!

313
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,330
Hurry...

314
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,760
Thank you for waiting, Chairman Isozaki.

315
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,860
I've brought Maya.

316
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,760
Go on.

317
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,960
Oh! I have been waiting for you Maya.

318
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,730
Thank you, Ms. Reika.

319
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,170
My pleasure.

320
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,940
Maya, look at the night view from here.
Isn't it gorgeous?

321
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,180
Oh!

322
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,460
It's beautiful...

323
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,840
Now, Maya, it's time for you to show me...

324
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,100
Yes.

325
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,280
Here you are. Please look well.

326
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,580
This is great!

327
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,320
Maya, I destroyed all the other
androids after I met you,

328
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:49,340
because I couldn't be
satisfied by any of them.

329
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,530
I'm happy only because you are with me.

330
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,860
No!

331
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,000
Oh?!

332
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,540
It's no good. I can't stand it anymore.

333
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,970
This is an interesting play.

334
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,310
The is the best. An android and a real human.

335
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,820
I'm glad I lived a long life.

336
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,280
Maya...

337
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,770
Maya... Where are you?

338
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,150
Ohhh... This is the best.

339
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,740
C- Chairman... I can't breathe!

340
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,340
No!

341
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,120
I'm kind of tired.

342
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,150
Hey...

343
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,660
Well... What were you doing here?

344
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,030
Me?

345
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,470
Yes... What is your name?

346
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:07,340
Ma.. ya... Maya... Maya!

347
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,900
Ten years later...

348
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,210
The city became a much nicer place
after the new Mayor was elected.

349
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:25,310
Maybe it's only me who didn't
change and is stuck in the past.

350
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,510
Look at this.

351
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,320
See... Isn't she cute?

352
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,650
Maya... where are you now?

353
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,500
Well, I guess somebody's here for you.

354
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,180
Were you being good?

355
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,410
Where do you want to go, Madam Mayor?

356
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:04,350
Well... where should we go, Ichiro?

357
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,490
Since it's my day off, let's go to the lake.
