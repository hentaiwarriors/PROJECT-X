1
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:44,066
Ayane, I'll definitely...

2
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:17,629
R

3
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:17,729
Ri

4
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:17,829
Rip

5
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:17,929
Ripp

6
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:18,029
Rippe

7
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:18,129
Ripped

8
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:18,229
Ripped B

9
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:18,329
Ripped By

10
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:18,429
Ripped By H

11
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:18,529
Ripped By Ha

12
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:18,629
Ripped By Han

13
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:18,729
Ripped By Hana

14
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:18,829
Ripped By Hanak

15
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:22,029
Ripped By Hanako

16
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:27,775
All right, be a good girl.

17
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:28,472
Little Mie...

18
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:29,980
Don't move.

19
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:32,410
I'll take you back to your owner.

20
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:41,992
Don't make your
owner worry too much.

21
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:01,375
No, stay away!

22
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:06,315
Be quiet.

23
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:08,286
We'll take you to your brother.

24
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:12,319
What are you big guys doing?

25
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:23,833
Why are they surprised?

26
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:26,161
Unbelievable, he's still alive.

27
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:27,970
In that case, we'll take care of you.

28
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:39,280
What?

29
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:46,855
Hey you!

30
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:00,062
Come with me.

31
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:03,703
Hurry up!

32
00:03:12,018 --> 00:03:14,578
Shingo, just as I
hoped, you are all right.

33
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:19,416
What?

34
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:34,039
Ayane Akimoto?

35
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:35,197
Yes.

36
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,611
But I'm not your missing brother.

37
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:45,348
I'm just a detective.

38
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,954
Here.

39
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:56,587
Thank you very much.

40
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,661
Takayasu, you used that trick of
yours on an automatic pistol, didn't you?

41
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:02,259
Yes.

42
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:06,529
What type of gun?

43
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:07,531
Let me see...

44
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:10,435
Maybe, Browning?

45
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:13,539
I don't remember,
because I acted instinctively.

46
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:15,140
Be careful.

47
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,547
You can only use that trick
on a gun with a recoil slide.

48
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:19,908
What?

49
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:21,945
Otherwise, it could still fire.

50
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:22,913
What?

51
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:25,055
You should be careful about that.

52
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,049
Excuse me...

53
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:30,789
Please help me, Mr. Higashino.

54
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:33,162
I'll give you any reward.

55
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:38,934
Takayasu, would you turn
your back on a crying girl?

56
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:45,403
All right, please tell me the details.

57
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:46,969
Yes.

58
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:55,718
Shingo...

59
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,258
You got back safely, did you?

60
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:04,590
It was a miracle.

61
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:07,532
Are you really Shingo?

62
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:12,696
Gosuke, because of
the accident, his memory is...

63
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:14,471
He lost his memory, did he?

64
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:15,330
Yes.

65
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:19,868
How did he ever survive that accident?

66
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,947
Shingo, you need rest, don't you?

67
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:25,208
Yes...

68
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:26,685
I see.

69
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,886
Go back to your room and recuperate.

70
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:30,381
All right.

71
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,359
Taizo!

72
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:45,968
It's OK.

73
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:48,063
We'll get the story later.

74
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:49,803
Sounds good.

75
00:05:55,715 --> 00:06:00,015
Well, what happened here, I wonder.

76
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:03,087
Ayane's parents died...

77
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:07,991
...the family fortune was inherited by
Shingo and his adopted sister, Ayane.

78
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:14,258
Ayane's aunt, Kiyoe,
the sister of Shingo's father...

79
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:17,535
Her husband, Gosuke...

80
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:24,366
Kiyoe's brother, Taizo,
the brother of Shingo's father...

81
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:27,209
None of them got any inheritance.

82
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:30,239
Then, it was two months ago...

83
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,647
Shingo, Ayane's step-brother,
had an accident and died...

84
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:35,779
After that, Ayane was attacked.

85
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,052
I think it is trouble over the inheritance.

86
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,251
The question is, who is...

87
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,991
Yes, come in.

88
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,129
Ayane...

89
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,907
What's going on so late?

90
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,469
Shingo...

91
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:04,243
I missed you so much.

92
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:07,714
No, I'm not your brother...

93
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,055
Excuse me...

94
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:19,260
It's all right.

95
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:29,800
Please make me forget, Mr. Higashino.

96
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,236
Ayane...

97
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:37,508
Shingo, you are...

98
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:42,186
...fantastic.

99
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:44,920
Ayane.

100
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,520
I realized that...

101
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,891
I realized after Shingo had died...

102
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:52,530
I still love Shingo.

103
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:17,915
No...

104
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:26,892
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:33,702
Shingo, you are still hard.

106
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:54,382
You really are sensitive, aren't you?

107
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:56,792
You're getting wet.

108
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,268
Shingo, please love me...

109
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:15,273
It's all right, even if it's forbidden love...

110
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:17,179
Please...

111
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,644
Ayane.

112
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:21,883
I want you.

113
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:25,214
Please, Shingo.

114
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:39,401
You are good...

115
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:41,167
Shingo, it's so good...

116
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,611
Please, together...

117
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:56,513
Shingo...

118
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:00,943
Oh God, I finally made love with you.

119
00:11:02,488 --> 00:11:04,615
Mr. Higashino, thank you very much.

120
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:14,032
Ayane, you are...

121
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:19,027
Mr. Higashino, you really
look like my step-brother.

122
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:34,951
Ayane...

123
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,211
Ayane!

124
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:26,326
I screwed up.

125
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,267
I didn't imagine they
would take action so soon.

126
00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:33,706
Oh!

127
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:38,145
Kiyoe...

128
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,843
What's happening?

129
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,284
Was that Ayane's scream?

130
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:54,464
Have some...

131
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:55,656
It will relax you.

132
00:12:56,969 --> 00:12:57,628
Thanks.

133
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,435
Where's uncle and the others?

134
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,871
They went out to find Ayane.

135
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:05,670
We should go to.

136
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:09,971
But, somebody has to stay here.

137
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:28,189
By the way, who are you really?

138
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:29,927
You're not Shingo, are you?

139
00:13:31,737 --> 00:13:33,170
What are you talking about?

140
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:35,230
You don't have to lie.

141
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:40,174
How did you approach Ayane?

142
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:44,147
Why don't you become my partner?

143
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,552
I'll make you feel better
than such a young girl can.

144
00:13:57,429 --> 00:13:59,522
What do you mean, auntie?

145
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:04,028
You are so rude to call me that.

146
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:05,798
Call me Kiyoe.

147
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:31,191
How's that?

148
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:32,992
You feel like your body is
melting completely, don't you?

149
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:35,558
What a waste of drugs.

150
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:36,794
You're gonna kill her, right?

151
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,103
We're gonna enjoy her body until then.

152
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:57,054
You can't stand any more, can you?

153
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:02,786
I mixed some drug into the drink.

154
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:07,591
The drug will make you very horny.

155
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:11,667
First of all, why don't
you tell me who you are?

156
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:14,898
I'll make you feel much, much better.

157
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:17,902
You want to feel better, right?

158
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,971
Come on, you won't be able to
control yourself if you don't tell.

159
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:24,138
I don't think so.

160
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,883
You can't fool me.

161
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:29,686
You're becoming horny to the core.

162
00:15:33,258 --> 00:15:35,818
Looks like you're the
one who's getting hot.

163
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:37,051
What?

164
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:49,637
I noticed something wrong, so I
substituted your glass for mine secretly.

165
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:50,938
You're so bad.

166
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:54,305
How can you say that
after you set a trap for me?

167
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:27,110
Do you want it?

168
00:16:28,414 --> 00:16:29,278
I want...

169
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:31,238
I want yours.

170
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:35,251
Can I come into your mouth?

171
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:38,153
Please come inside me.

172
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:39,591
Give it to me.

173
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:40,886
Make me feel good, please.

174
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,486
That's the way.

175
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,605
I'm going crazy.

176
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,551
I'm coming.

177
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:18,785
Don't stop!

178
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:21,656
Please tell me where Ayane is.

179
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:25,002
I don't know.

180
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:26,635
Don't play dumb, please.

181
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:31,205
If you don't tell, I'll stop.

182
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:34,608
All right, I'll tell you.

183
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:37,077
So please, give it to me now.

184
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,696
She is really enjoying it.

185
00:17:59,238 --> 00:18:00,728
The drug is too effective, isn't it?

186
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:06,875
Never mind that, our boss is so strong.

187
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:09,311
How many times has he done it so far?

188
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,689
Please...

189
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:21,523
Give me more...

190
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:26,621
Who are you?

191
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:34,200
You are...

192
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:03,199
That's it...

193
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:08,003
I never knew there
was a basement here.

194
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,801
Good things are
sometimes right under your nose.

195
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:13,777
You're not Shingo, as I thought.

196
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:16,806
Come on, release Ayane.

197
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:20,417
Don't move if you
consider her important.

198
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:22,686
It's too late.

199
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:30,126
It's too late for you.

200
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:31,930
You as well?

201
00:19:32,264 --> 00:19:34,357
Sounds like you are not Shingo.

202
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:35,693
But who cares?

203
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,428
You're going to die with Ayane.

204
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:43,106
It is a good story for us,
you'll kill Ayane and then yourself.

205
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:15,467
How do you feel?

206
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:20,843
Take a look before you die.

207
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,845
Ayane can't think of
anything but sex with the drugs.

208
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:31,018
Here, she looks happy.

209
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,688
Ayane is your adopted niece...

210
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,922
How can you do this,
even for inheritance?

211
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:50,399
Ayane and Shingo's father,
my and Kiyoe's brother...

212
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:54,368
...left a legacy for Shingo and
his adopted daughter, Ayane.

213
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:55,644
I will not forgive them.

214
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:57,414
There is another story...

215
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,116
I knew of the relationship
between Ayane and Shingo.

216
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:06,315
Although she grew
up to be so beautiful...

217
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:07,923
...she was innocent...

218
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,127
...and even though I
thought she led a happy life...

219
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,030
...she had a relationship
with her step-brother, Shingo.

220
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:15,459
I felt jealousy.

221
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:20,932
I think I wanted to rape her
because she was no longer innocent.

222
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,609
The whole idea originally came
from Kiyoe, who has a big debt.

223
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:28,542
We kill Shingo, and pretend
that he died in a traffic accident...

224
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:30,306
Then we get the inheritance.

225
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:36,143
We will kill Ayane
after we enjoy her body.

226
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:38,348
You aren't human.

227
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,858
Are you finished talking?

228
00:21:41,727 --> 00:21:44,161
I really have a grudge against you.

229
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:45,720
Say good-bye.

230
00:21:59,244 --> 00:22:02,077
You're kidding me, can it be...

231
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:10,980
...you are still alive.

232
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,624
No, you cannot be alive.

233
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:20,261
You changed my
looks a bit, but I am Shingo.

234
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:25,935
Shingo, you are...

235
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:30,671
Shingo!

236
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:34,175
Kiyoe is already waiting
for you in the pits of hell.

237
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:48,452
Wait, Shingo.

238
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,958
I came here only to pay you back.

239
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:13,842
Ayane...

240
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:17,618
Brother...

241
00:23:29,768 --> 00:23:30,632
What's that?

242
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:33,465
I set fire to the mansion.

243
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,839
I guess something exploded.

244
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:37,571
What?

245
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:41,074
Come on, let's get out of here.

246
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:43,204
We are fine.

247
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,247
What are you talking about?

248
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:54,954
Hurry up!

249
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:56,951
Leave us alone and run away.

250
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:58,193
I can't.

251
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,730
There is no other way but
for us to finish ourselves.

252
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,567
Thank you for saving Ayane.

253
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:09,940
I appreciate it.

254
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:13,442
Good-bye, Mr. Higashino.

255
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:16,736
Ayane.

256
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:43,605
Shingo, Ayane...

257
00:24:54,553 --> 00:24:57,420
After everything I did not save Ayane...

258
00:24:58,557 --> 00:24:59,785
I'm disappointed about that.

259
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:03,188
That's life.

260
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,593
They'd already decided
that from the beginning...

261
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:09,060
...in order for her to be
with her step-brother forever.

262
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:10,999
I know, but...

263
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:18,576
Hello?

264
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:20,175
Come in.

265
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:22,545
Hey, your client is here.

266
00:25:23,682 --> 00:25:24,444
Yes.

267
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:28,775
Did you find my cat, Mie?

268
00:25:30,288 --> 00:25:30,947
Shit!
