1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,166
My father passed away.

2
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,939
I received a Ietter from a
woman who married my father...

3
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,380
...whiIe I was away at boarding schooI.

4
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:21,411
In other words, it
was from my stepmother.

5
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,215
My father was the son of a weaIthy man.

6
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,852
But he Iead a Iife of debauchery...

7
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:34,861
...and my mother couIdn't stand
his drinking and wiId behavior...

8
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,129
...so she hanged herseIf.

9
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,478
I don't have any good
memories of my home...

10
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,388
But I Ieft schooI to see my
father's face one Iast time.

11
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:08,664
<i>The Duchess of Busty Mounds Vol. 1</i>

12
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,686
You're the onIy one I have.

13
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,422
Stay with me aIways.

14
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,107
Mother...

15
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,950
It's been 2 years...

16
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,386
Jean?

17
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:09,459
Jean!

18
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,958
WeIcome back!

19
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,290
Can't be!

20
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,467
Is this possibIe?

21
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:24,165
My stepmother SyIvia Iooks
so much Iike my mother!

22
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,488
And right then, it brought
back memories of my chiIdhood.

23
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,007
Your father got drunk and
feII off from his horse.

24
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,511
I saw his face, but I
didn't feeI sad at aII.

25
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,818
I knew he wouId end
up Iike this one day.

26
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:49,721
I'm sure SyIvia had a hard
time deaIing with his behavior.

27
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,060
She didn't even cry at the funeraI.

28
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,018
Mother...

29
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:02,624
Yes?

30
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,628
My name is Apache and I'm
the Iawyer for the famiIy.

31
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,870
I'm sure you're aware
of this by now, but...

32
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:13,309
...the Iate master disinherited
you, so you won't get any money.

33
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,377
AIso, this house wiII be
passed on to an outsider.

34
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,243
So my cIient, who happens
to be your grandfather...

35
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:23,754
...in other words, master CharieI,
the current head of the famiIy...

36
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,222
...wouId Iike to Iook after you two.

37
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,586
I don't think it's a bad idea.

38
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,430
And so, my grandfather who owns
a huge pIantation took us in.

39
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:26,710
I'd Iike to weIcome you two, but
we don't have any empty rooms.

40
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,289
For the time being, I want
you two to stay in a house...

41
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,447
...detached from the main compound.

42
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,690
Where's the master?

43
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,797
He's resting right now.

44
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,025
I was asked to take care of you two.

45
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,729
If you need anything, you come to me.

46
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,203
Yes, we understand.

47
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,704
To teII you the truth,
you peopIe are a nuisance.

48
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:55,212
If you want to stay here, you'II have
to work from tomorrow on.

49
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,124
Understood?

50
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,489
Yes.

51
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,722
We have a pIace for the time
being, so Iet's stay here.

52
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,763
I'm afraid we have no other choice.

53
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,268
Don't be so sad.

54
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,164
I'm sure things wiII
get better for you, Jean.

55
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,510
I'II be fine, SyIvia.

56
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:10,255
In these poor Iiving conditions, I was
embraced by my stepmother's scent...

57
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,788
...and I was feeIing somewhat happy.

58
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,256
WeII? What do you
think about my cooking?

59
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,861
It's reaIIy good.

60
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,499
There's pIenty of food
and we're Iiving together.

61
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,796
It's not as bad as I thought.

62
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,701
As Iong as I'm here with you,
I can bear any kind of hardship.

63
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,269
Good morning.

64
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,314
Sorry to interrupt, you two.

65
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,449
Yes, what is it?

66
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,917
What is it?

67
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,989
What an impudent fooI you are!

68
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:51,456
You peopIe are Iike
parasites, eating aII our food!

69
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,063
It's time for you to work!

70
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,135
Yes, I understand.

71
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:03,072
You go cIean the mansion. The
boy can go cIean the stabIe.

72
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,006
If you don't do a good job, our
master wiII kick you both out.

73
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,809
Who do you think Iet you stay here?

74
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,441
Your Iate husband Ieft
this pIace on his own.

75
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,078
And yet my mother feIt sorry for him.

76
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,490
Yes, I understand.

77
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,955
That's better.

78
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,961
You just treat us Iike your masters.

79
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,602
I guess we have no choice.

80
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,702
WeII, I'm heading over to the mansion.

81
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,853
You're doing a pretty good job.

82
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,589
I wonder how Iong you'II Iast?

83
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,109
What are you doing?

84
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,113
Is that how you taIk to your master?

85
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,282
Saucy feIIow.

86
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,476
Do you care about your stepmother?

87
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,748
There's Iots of hot-bIooded
workers here, you know.

88
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,058
Listen up, Jean.

89
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,753
From now on, you're my sIave.

90
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,954
You'II do whatever I say.

91
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:33,897
Understand?

92
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,661
Yes, ma'am.

93
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,233
Then I'II teII you
what to do immediateIy.

94
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,078
Now, come over here and Iick.

95
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,422
Over here.

96
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,070
That's it.

97
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,705
Lick me more.

98
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,645
I'm getting chiIIs down my spine.

99
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,724
Suck it, hurry up and suck on it.

100
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,930
Harder!

101
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,200
I can't take it anymore.

102
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,832
I want your thing!

103
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,078
So hard.

104
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,213
It's big and hard.

105
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,019
You're gonna serve me
everyday with this thing.

106
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,339
Now stick it inside me.

107
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,848
You're gonna make me
cIimax with your thing.

108
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,095
It feeIs good.

109
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,824
Do me harder with that thing of yours...

110
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,596
I can't take it anymore.

111
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,237
I'm about to cIimax.

112
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,374
Do it inside me.

113
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,783
ReIease that hot juice
of yours inside me.

114
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:20,362
I'm gonna cIimax!

115
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,835
Come here again tomorrow, got it?

116
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:30,840
Yes.

117
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,392
I'm home.

118
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,062
You sound very energetic.

119
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,034
Looks Iike you can work here after aII.

120
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,070
Where's my stepmother?

121
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,573
She's staying over at
the mansion for the night.

122
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,540
What?

123
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,073
Did something happen?

124
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,283
How shouId I know?

125
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:17,114
Since she's not here, I
was toId to make your meaI.

126
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:19,751
Thanks.

127
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,059
You can't keep worrying forever.

128
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:29,132
You just need to think
about your situation.

129
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,766
WeII, see ya.

130
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,440
SyIvia...

131
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,888
SyIvia...

132
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,619
Good morning Jean.

133
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,988
Was everything aII right yesterday?

134
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:01,132
Yes, it took a very Iong
time to cIean the mansion.

135
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,028
I see.

136
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,136
Are you doing aII this on your own?

137
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,339
That's right. I have to work harder!

138
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,501
But it's gonna get dark soon.

139
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,875
You know what, I'II heIp you.

140
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,405
It's okay.

141
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,847
You have your own work to do.

142
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,077
That's right.

143
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,588
I'II give you something
to do if you're that free.

144
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,890
Go get some firewood from the forest.

145
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,497
Don't worry, I'II be fine on my own.

146
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,399
You just go and get some firewood.

147
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,633
You want me don't you?

148
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:55,309
AII the guys in the viIIage want me.

149
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,709
But I'II Iet you have me anytime.

150
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,487
Hurry up and do me.

151
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,004
I knew your cock wouId be the best.

152
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,111
Harder!

153
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,193
Your cock is banging me.

154
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,303
It's banging me!

155
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,809
No, I feeI Iike I'm about to pee!

156
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,236
Jean, you're Iate.

157
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,610
SmeIIs Iike Tina's perfume!

158
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,042
You did it with Tina didn't you?

159
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,014
I was forced to do it
with her in the forest.

160
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,693
Don't you ever do it with Tina again!

161
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,458
No, not just Tina.

162
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,729
Don't you ever do it with
another woman again, got it?

163
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,363
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,673
This beIongs to me.

165
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,698
WeII, Iooks Iike I'm done for today.

166
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,293
Sir?

167
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,692
You Iike books?

168
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,531
Do you Iike books?

169
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,829
Yes.

170
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,827
Books are good.

171
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,839
Your Iife wiII be so
much better with books.

172
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,206
You can go ahead and read
these books if you Iike.

173
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,178
But return them to their proper sheIf.

174
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,348
Yes. Thank you very much.

175
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,613
My grandfather was different
from the others I've met.

176
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,156
The pIantation has been
inherited for generations...

177
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,956
...but he was abIe to increase
the size of the pIantation...

178
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:08,065
And received so much
respect from the neighbors.

179
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,366
But he seemed somewhat
IoneIy in my eyes.

180
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,045
SyIvia...

181
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm home.

182
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,760
WeIcome home.

183
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,260
You must be tired.

184
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,391
I'II fix your meaI.

185
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,694
I met my grandfather today.

186
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,099
Oh reaIIy?

187
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,397
Did he say anything to you?

188
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:54,242
Yeah, he said I can
read his books anytime.

189
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,544
That's nice.

190
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:00,243
You Ieft schooI, so this
might be good for you.

191
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,420
He must reaIIy Iike you then.

192
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,780
ReaIIy? I sure hope so.

193
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,456
I'm sure.

194
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,585
We'II be abIe to Iive
a normaI IifestyIe soon.

195
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,423
I'm sure your grandfather
wiII make it happen.

196
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:36,946
Ouch!

197
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,955
Jean, where did you get those scars?

198
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,191
From Marianne.

199
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,965
That's horribIe. I'm sorry.

200
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,094
I didn't know you were
having such a hard time.

201
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,967
I'm aII right now.

202
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,541
Stay stiII.

203
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,693
No, I'm your stepmother.

204
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,497
This isn't right.

205
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:29,500
No. I can't take it anymore.

206
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,299
I Iike you.

207
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,509
I reaIIy Iove you.

208
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,741
Thank you for teIIing me that.

209
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:41,717
But in order to Iive here, we can't
have this kind of reIationship.

210
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,350
You don't Iike me?

211
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,185
I do Iove you.

212
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,091
We're not reIated by bIood.

213
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,532
So...

214
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:59,960
No matter what we do, it's
not considered profane!

215
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,303
No!

216
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:22,025
SyIvia, your crotch is so warm and wet.

217
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,391
Stop it, Jean.

218
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,734
We're gonna Iive together
from here on, right?

219
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,898
You're gonna Iove me
no matter what, right?

220
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,475
Oh God!

221
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,427
Yes, I'm so happy.

222
00:24:57,395 --> 00:25:00,694
More, suck me harder!

223
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,173
Thank you, SyIvia.

224
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,943
You reaIIy Iove me.

225
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:26,953
We can onIy do it up to this point,
we can't go any further with this.

226
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,627
I can't take it anymore.

227
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,327
Look how hard I've gotten...

228
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:33,959
I'm getting so...

229
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,961
Me too.

230
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,360
But...

231
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,470
I don't reaIIy care what happens.

232
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,907
No, anything but that!

233
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,943
You're Iying! You want me too.

234
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,482
So...

235
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,516
See? You reaIIy want me.

236
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,731
I'm so happy.
