1
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,010
Wataru

2
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,680
You've watched me all along?

3
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,850
There's only you in my heart

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,480
I love you, hug me now!

5
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,940
Mai!

6
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,820
It hurts! Back at home indeed

7
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,990
Almost can be with Mai in the dream...

8
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,200
Who is it?! So noisy!

9
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,000
"Doukyuusei ~ Chapter 1"

10
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,180
"When summer ends"

11
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,520
Wataru has gone out

12
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,350
Please call again after 10 years

13
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,190
Wataru!? It's me. Katsuya

14
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,350
That guy. Katsuya, idiot!

15
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,070
Calling me so early in the summer morning

16
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,480
There's one thing which is very important to me

17
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,240
There's a big matter of life
I have to talk with you

18
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,530
I know nothing!

19
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,450
I just know I have to see Mai now

20
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,700
Wait, you heartless!

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,120
We still have chances later on, let's meet with me first

22
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,450
Understand, no matter how
I have to hang up the phone

23
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,540
Promised?
See you at the station at 11 o'clock!

24
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,170
Today is the birthday of Kurumi,

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,300
no wonder... Katsuya..

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,610
Work hard! Work hard!

27
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,400
Wataru!

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,620
It hurts!

29
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,080
Wataru, you come to peep on girls again?

30
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,460
Misa!

31
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,170
Only obscene people peep

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,010
You say so because of having a guilty conscience

33
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,760
What?

34
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,300
Misa, even if you're naked,

35
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
no one would come to peep.

36
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,720
Is it from the Banbi of track club?

37
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,770
It's too impolite to me

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,100
Banbi said...
You think whatever you like

39
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,400
Wataru, could you write back a letter?

40
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,730
What letter?

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,940
Oh, Miho, she is very annoyed!

42
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,740
That kid is so simple!

43
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,160
This will hurt her heart

44
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,740
Understand, I'm a gentleman you know

45
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,200
Wataru...

46
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:22,950
Bye

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,870
Idiot!

48
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,130
Misa, that girl never changes at all

49
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,380
just like a boy. Compare with her.

50
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,970
Mai is the best beauty.

51
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,430
she has woman style, no matter what I have to do.

52
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,100
I must date her in this summer.

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Mai! Try hard!

54
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,940
Everybody stand by!

55
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,190
Moroko Wataru!

56
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,860
Don't watch Mai in nasty eyesight

57
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,490
Ready!

58
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,330
She is the golden sportswoman who
bears the reputation of the school

59
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,450
Do you knew what your status?

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,250
The flower on high mountain, can you pick it in your hand?

61
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,750
Before you fail painfully, let's give up!

62
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,420
Keinze, how you can you talk to me in this way?

63
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,680
Mai is for me.

64
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,010
I'm a different man

65
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,600
You'll know it someday

66
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,770
What? This guy...

67
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,940
Not good!

68
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,690
Miho

69
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,280
Yes, welcome

70
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,030
Wataru!

71
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,070
Good afternoon.

72
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,870
What can I do for you? Really...

73
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,910
Make a bunch of flowers of 3000 dollars for me.

74
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,290
Let's make a luxurious one with 10 thousand dollars.

75
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,170
Understood!

76
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,090
You!

77
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,840
This is the punishment of you being late

78
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,310
Do you know I've worked part time job
almost the whole summer holiday?

79
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,720
This money...

80
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,480
Only with Mai I can...

81
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,940
have a wonderful memory of summer holiday

82
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,980
Serious? Let's stop.

83
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,570
Mai is a 100% real rich daughter.

84
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,070
Doesn't suit you, you will only cry at the end

85
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,410
Understand? Face the reality

86
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,120
Aren't you the same?

87
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,710
Kurumi also haven't showed anything to you, right?

88
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,710
So, today is Kurumi's birthday...

89
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,750
I've already decided to give what present.

90
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,630
You've waited so long

91
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,130
Is this?

92
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,470
Big Gift

93
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,970
Then... thank you, bye, thanks

94
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,890
Lend me your motor bike.

95
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,260
Wait... Katsuya!

96
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,640
I...

97
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,980
What?

98
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,270
You already read the letter?

99
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,400
I've seen it, this is...

100
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,570
No, so shameful

101
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm so shy, use letter to reply me.

102
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,200
Please!

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,450
Mi... Miho...?

104
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,420
Katsuya! You're late!

105
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,090
Sorry... look at this!
Happy birthday!

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,460
Katsuya, you really... Thanks!

107
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,090
So beautiful

108
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,510
But, are the flowers expensive?

109
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,930
Nothing

110
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,100
But I don't have anything in return

111
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,980
Then... Give me a kiss is alright...

112
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,730
If you hug me, that's even better...

113
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,770
No, Katsuya always joke with me.

114
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,820
It's not a joke!

115
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,820
Welcome!

116
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,660
What happened, Wataru?

117
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,080
In short, can't say in few words

118
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,870
Such a hot weather

119
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Treat people as puppet...

120
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,250
Katsuya!

121
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:56,710
Hello!

122
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,710
Wataru, good afternoon.

123
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,300
Kurumi

124
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,510
Katsuya is good at playing ropes and candles the most

125
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,850
Be careful!

126
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,970
Yes, but I also like switching off the light.

127
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,480
the thing that lighting lots of candles.

128
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,110
Seems like their lines are perfect.

129
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,860
I also can't consider so much anymore

130
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,070
I have to date with Mai as soon as possible.

131
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,700
Mai!

132
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,970
Thanks

133
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,770
You like reading this kind of novel?

134
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,940
You always come here?

135
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,900
Not always

136
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,900
When I have an exam...

137
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,320
Want to take a walk with me?

138
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,070
Sometimes you have to relax

139
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,950
This... I have to join the alumni club...

140
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,580
and I have to learn piano and tea ceremony

141
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,000
Many things have to do...

142
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:17,960
So...

143
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,500
Sorry!

144
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,460
Mai...

145
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,460
What kind answer is that?

146
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,430
So tired! Can't concentrate...

147
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,810
Katsuya!

148
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,030
Listen to me... Kurumi...
Kurumi she...

149
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,820
Very tired...

150
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,200
Katsuya just said such words...

151
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,780
He must have taken her to the hotel then be refused

152
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,330
"Yes, that's it..."

153
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,330
Just come back after saying that?

154
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,170
Work hard! Work hard!

155
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,010
Everybody is sweating the sweat of youth

156
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:11,800
Misa

157
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Just as what Banbi said

158
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,650
If you work a little bit harder,

159
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,200
you'll be able to stand out in this field

160
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,420
Not good

161
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,800
Wataru, don't you sleep more in summer?

162
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,390
You even come to school everyday

163
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,430
Is it because you always shirk as usual?

164
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,010
This is because...

165
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,850
I disgust the school which we have to study a lot

166
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,860
But the school we don't have to study, I like it.

167
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:05,980
Satisfied?

168
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,610
Even with such an excuse, you have other purpose, right?

169
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,570
Wataru, no matter what, you're free, right?

170
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,410
Then... something...

171
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,040
Tanaka

172
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:20,830
Yes

173
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,290
Tanaka, please come with me

174
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,170
Yes

175
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,130
Wataru, bye!

176
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,340
What did this guys say?

177
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,720
Forget it!

178
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,970
Undrestand? Tanaka

179
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,100
Yes

180
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,520
Keinze and Mai...

181
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,320
Mai! Don't show your smile in front of that guy

182
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,610
Should find out some solutions...

183
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,950
Who is it?

184
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,000
Wataru, come with me. OK?

185
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,420
Your parents want you to quit the track sport?!

186
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,800
Quit the sport club, and concentrate in preparing for the exam

187
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,670
Already in form 3 of high school

188
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,930
Your parents are right.

189
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,180
After you quit track club,

190
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,100
maybe you can be more girly.

191
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,940
Wataru, I'm serious to discuss this with you!

192
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,690
You even...

193
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,190
It's good to be as you

194
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,110
Just feel happy being with girls usually

195
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,360
How come...?

196
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,450
Wataru, if quitting from track club,

197
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,570
can you imagine what would it be?

198
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,790
From form I to now at high school

199
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,080
Till the start of final racing

200
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,630
The final racing,
I have to complete it.

201
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,460
Let's complete it!

202
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,590
Then continue the track!

203
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,800
Don't care about what your parents said

204
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,970
Wataru...

205
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Do it with confidence, Misa

206
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,680
Isn't it the best?

207
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,720
Yes... yes

208
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,400
Thanks, Wataru

209
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,820
Yes...? She even says thanks from her mouth

210
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,320
She must be sick

211
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,410
Wataru...

212
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,370
No!

213
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,620
No!

214
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,210
Don't shout like that, OK?

215
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,380
Wataru

216
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,590
Although it's a very shameful thing.

217
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,220
But you also have to courage to speak it out

218
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,680
I Miho...

219
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,850
I Miho... want to date you to watch movie.

220
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,100
It's best to watch love story

221
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,020
Waiting for your response

222
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,940
From Susuki Miho

223
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,190
No!

224
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,900
Miho, can you be quied?

225
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,570
Sorry...

226
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,870
No!

227
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,950
Behave yourself!

228
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,410
Let's go out!

229
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,970
Wataru, what have you done to Miho?

230
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,260
Nothing... that?

231
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,220
Yesterday when she called me, she was crying all along

232
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,680
What's happened?

233
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,810
This is... That event...

234
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,280
The one who wanna cry is me.

235
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,450
This date would result this way

236
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,080
You're thinking of any trick again?

237
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,830
Do you know? Wataru

238
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,460
Miho is different from the girls you used to date with

239
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,920
This time you make her cry, then there'll not be next time

240
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,590
Who you like then?

241
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,970
Don't ask... This...

242
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,260
Say it clearly!

243
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,760
This... It's you, Misa

244
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,270
Misa, you're the one I like most.

245
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,270
Really, idiot

246
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,150
What's the matter?

247
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,110
Bye-bye

248
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,280
Bye

249
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,700
See you tomorrow

250
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,490
Mai, bye-bye

251
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,280
Bye-bye

252
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,200
Can't refuse a date this time,
right?

253
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,790
Sorry, goodbye

254
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,470
Is it true that you date with Keinze?

255
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,800
Really true

256
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,810
Don't say these, it's a lie... those words

257
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,020
Really?

258
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,060
Right

259
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,690
Men should have strength

260
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,360
If you have strength, that's the best

261
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,320
Family background and property
are just the next important things

262
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,660
Don't gift me, MY SON

263
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,490
Wataru have no strength!

264
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,910
That's something in novel...

265
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,910
That fire shoot out

266
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,960
If that fire shoot out

267
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,420
Next chapter is...

268
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,090
A body appears in front of a girl

269
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,130
his chest is shaking on the girl's breast.

270
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,010
This...

271
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,300
That's this elastic force!

272
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,310
I've imagine that under this school uniform before...

273
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,480
That's this elastic force!
The teenager is touched

274
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,310
In a scene just as he said

275
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,650
Expecting all along...

276
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,860
Let's go to southern island together, OK?

277
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,490
The playground of YaBuCyo city

278
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,570
Just heard that at southern island a

279
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,660
"WATER PARK" opened

280
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,120
Let's go to play!

281
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,330
I...

282
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,580
This Friday, 01:00 pm

283
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,080
I wait for you at playground

284
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,000
Piano lesson is arranged that day...

285
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,710
Can't you skip once?

286
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,920
Yes... yes...

287
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,630
Good, we've decided it

288
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,300
See you at playground this Friday!

289
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,430
Success

290
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,770
Really a pestering boy again

291
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,900
Misa?

292
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,950
What you doing here?

293
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,490
Bleeding?!

294
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,500
Nothing! Just a little wounds means nothing to me

295
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,500
Don't touch me!

296
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,170
Misa

297
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,970
What... are you doing? Stop!

298
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,300
C'mon! We return to take back the bike later

299
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,810
So shameful! Put me down!

300
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,020
You...

301
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,140
I've told you to put me down!
So hurt!

302
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,600
Idiot! Wataru, put me down!

303
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,610
If you still move so violently, the wound will be more serious

304
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,150
You'll be a cripple

305
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,490
The racing is near, right?

306
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,820
You should protect your legs well

307
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,660
Misa...

308
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,200
Your breasts are so big

309
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,000
Blockhead!

310
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,440
Can't say in anyway?

311
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,320
Your knee bone being so because you've over practiced

312
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,450
Now stop the running practice

313
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,780
If you don't do surgery...

314
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:54,990
No

315
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,870
Don't be so self witted!
Teachers are worried about you so

316
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,960
Misa, you've already try your best, let's just give up

317
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,170
When you've cure your legs, then enter a common U...

318
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,970
Enough! Don't worry!

319
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,600
Wataru...

320
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,650
Hello, I'm Moroko Wataru... Makon Sensei!

321
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,190
If you wanna date me, it's more suitable to be at night

322
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,370
Misa? Yes... I come at once

323
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,790
Even such thing! Is it really?

324
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,920
But, why call me?

325
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,550
I don't know also

326
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,430
Tanaka has something to talk to you privately

327
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,270
I've heard from her, maybe it'll have a big effect

328
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,430
Maybe just you can do it only

329
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,940
Depend on you

330
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,440
Yes

331
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,900
I'll be at the teacher's office...

332
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,070
No, nothing

333
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,950
Stay by her side...

334
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,080
She's in the most painful period

335
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,370
Yes

336
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,420
Misa

337
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,590
Fell down during the morning practice...

338
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,130
Even changed into this, really unbelievable

339
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,810
Makon sensei has already told me

340
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,560
Right?

341
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,440
I'm really a fool

342
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,520
Because of practicing with all my force

343
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,770
Changed into can't run again

344
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,530
But... only Wataru you...

345
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,150
Told me that do with my confidence

346
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,570
Then that's OK...

347
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,660
Thank you, Wataru

348
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,490
Misa...

349
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,710
Finally, you can achieve what parents hope this way

350
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,460
No! Don't say such thing!

351
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,540
Everybody is worrying about your health...

352
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,500
I understand!

353
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,880
But...

354
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,310
Wataru

355
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,730
Misa

356
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,480
Although I don't know it clearly, if you recovered

357
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,650
Doesn't it mean that you can continue running?

358
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,280
Everybody say so!

359
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,950
This is my last chance

360
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,620
Therefore I endure the pain all along till now

361
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,710
No one understand my feeling originally

362
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,170
Sorry, Misa... But...

363
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,380
Everybody say so just because they worry about you

364
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,010
Especially me, I can't quarrel with a healthy you

365
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,300
I'm so lonely

366
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,850
Wataru

367
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,560
Let's brace up

368
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,770
Even you can't run again

369
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,150
It doesn't mean that you're over as so

370
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,340
I...

371
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,800
Is my muscle solid?

372
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,680
Very soft... So great

373
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,180
Very nice

374
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,680
Wataru... So shameful

375
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,770
No

376
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,120
Wataru

377
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,080
Here I go

378
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:40,960
So painful

379
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,760
Don't move

380
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,940
Wataru

381
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,410
Wataru

382
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,100
Wataru, Wataru

383
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,050
2 days later

384
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,010
Misa handed the resign letter to the track club

385
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,730
In autumn, I met Misa on the street.

386
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,810
Misa

387
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,190
Good afternoon, Wataru!
Long time no see

388
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,530
Accompany me for a while. OK?

389
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,450
I've heard that you've performed the surgery already

390
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,580
I'm fine now, I think
I can return to school soon

391
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,500
Really? That's great

392
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,460
Thank you

393
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,170
I...

394
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,840
I also feel that I persist unbelievably

395
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,050
How could it be that? Wataru

396
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,350
Don't know...

397
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,730
All along

398
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,520
I think that the track club is my whole life

399
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,730
But I found an other things which even excited me

400
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,730
What things?

401
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,940
I won't tell you now

402
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,820
Forget it! What kind of things will excite you?

403
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,780
A person who have so strong fighting feeling like Misa

404
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,200
Thank you, Wataru

405
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,580
Bye

406
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,630
Next time...
Next time, I'll to go your home to play

407
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,180
You can't run!

408
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,720
Forget it!

409
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,680
But... Misa, this tomboy

410
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,060
Finally speaks as a woman...

411
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,270
Why is it like that?
