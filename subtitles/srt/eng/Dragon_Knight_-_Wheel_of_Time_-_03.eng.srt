1
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,992
Eto, please have some. If\Nyou would like, of course.

2
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,989
It's just like when I was Kakeru.

3
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,006
Thank you, Marlene.

4
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,012
Why did you save me?

5
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:28,585
When that mast fell on\Nthe ship and you saved me,

6
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,947
that mast almost\Nfell on top of you.

7
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,323
I don't know why.

8
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:39,390
Before I knew it, I had\Nshoved you aside.

9
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,741
Eto...

10
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,578
Were you marooned on\Nthis island before?

11
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,274
Yes, it's the same\Nisland as before.

12
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,485
So, unless you do something\Nintentionally to change its course,

13
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,510
history repeats itself?

14
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,013
Well, it seems like it.

15
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,494
Of course, if everything\Nrepeats itself to the very end,

16
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,827
then there would be no point\Nfor me to have come back.

17
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:20,838
Do you believe me when I claim\NI'm Kakeru from the future?

18
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:26,646
It seems I have no choice\Nbut to believe you.

19
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,249
What is that black stone?

20
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,480
Well, before I can explain that,

21
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,923
I'll have to explain\Nabout where I came from.

22
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:43,021
Then I need to ask you. Where are\Nyou from, Marlene? Who are you?

23
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,295
Before I answer that, there\Nis something I'd like to ask.

24
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,107
Eto...

25
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,306
While we were on the\Nship, you said to me...

26
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:09,878
That I would live to regret\Nhelping Lucifon.

27
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,853
Yes, I said that.

28
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,756
Why would I regret?

29
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,522
Every one of us will fall\Nprey to Lucifon's powers.

30
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,826
And only I will remain alive.

31
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,165
I will be left to live a\Ncaptive for years on end,

32
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:32,939
until one day you\Nwill come before me.

33
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:37,309
When you handed me the black\Nstone, you said to me,

34
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:41,086
"Go back to the past\Nand persuade me."

35
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,959
You told me you could\Ncounter Lucifon's magic.

36
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,893
Persuade me?

37
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,088
You also said something\Nabout being wrong,

38
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,292
though I don't know what you\Nfelt you were wrong about.

39
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:59,072
I was wrong? That's what I said?

40
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:03,566
That's right. Your tone, your\Nvoice, it was exactly the same.

41
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,176
That I was wrong.

42
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,479
Yes, that's why I am here now.

43
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,580
Marlene, can't you\Ntell me anything?

44
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,943
Have you seen anything?

45
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:43,212
Nothing. Just clouds, ocean,\Nseagulls, sun, and the Black Mist.

46
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,347
It seems like the Black Mist\Nhas stopped moving these days.

47
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,421
That's right.

48
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,720
It will begin coming after us\Nonce we get off this island.

49
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,494
Why?

50
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:58,598
{\kf900000}Because Lucifon is getting\N{\kf900000}kicks from watching you suffer.

51
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,966
Me?

52
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,433
That's right.

53
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,038
I wonder if a rescue\Nship will really come?

54
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,706
Don't worry. It will.

55
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,368
Eto, you sound like you\Nknow a ship will come.

56
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,138
Well, no, not exactly.

57
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,682
I'll leave you in charge, all right?

58
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,760
Oh, Seil...

59
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,563
{\kf900000}Well, look...

60
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,098
Oh my, c'mon Seil!

61
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,827
Don't grab onto me like that!

62
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,901
You must persuade me.

63
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,511
Tomorrow, the ship will appear.

64
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,001
The journey's already half complete.

65
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,309
Marlene, what am I to do?!

66
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,256
Natasha?

67
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,188
What's the matter, Natasha?

68
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,597
Did you have a fight\Nwith Kakeru again?

69
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,035
Ever since we've come to this island,

70
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,003
I've hardly had a chance\Nto talk with Kakeru.

71
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,507
You may not have had a\Nchance to talk to him,

72
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,407
but that hasn't changed your\Nfeelings toward him, right?

73
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:55,448
Eto, you're so kind, thinking\Nof me. Not like Kakeru.

74
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,284
Maybe I should just dump\NKakeru and go out with you.

75
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,888
Get rid of silly thoughts\Nlike that, and get some rest.

76
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,824
But once I awake, my head will\Nbe filled with anxiety again.

77
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,485
I've had enough of this.

78
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,227
Natasha...

79
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,888
{\kf900000}I'm just tired of all of this.

80
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,363
Natasha, are you crying?

81
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,537
Natasha...

82
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:27,976
No, I'm not crying. I am not!

83
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,688
What?

84
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,695
What is it?

85
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,797
What is that you have on?

86
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,832
Oh, it's nothing.

87
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,167
Why do you have this talisman, Eto?

88
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,643
Well, actually, yesterday, Kakeru\Ngave it to me to hold on to.

89
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,914
That's a lie! I saw it on Kakeru's neck\Nwhen he slept on the watchtower!

90
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,381
Well...

91
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:07,116
Yes, this is the one I gave to Kakeru.

92
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,181
Eto, what's this about?!

93
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:15,321
Who are you? Take off your helmet!

94
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,332
If you won't say anything, then\NI'll tell everybody about this.

95
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,027
Oh, no, please don't!

96
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:26,339
If Kakeru were to learn who I\Nreally am, then I would disappear.

97
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,034
What's that?

98
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,243
No, nothing.

99
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,680
I'm serious! Why do you have the\Ntalisman that I gave to Kakeru?!

100
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,075
Why? Why would there be\Ntwo of the same thing?

101
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,622
I'll ask Kakeru about this tomorrow\Nmorning in front of everybody!

102
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,214
Wait, wait a minute!

103
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,533
All right, I'll tell you the truth.

104
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,312
I am Kakeru.

105
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,085
Don't be silly.

106
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,986
No, that's the truth.

107
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,621
Kakeru? Really?

108
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,293
No, wait! Don't put it on!

109
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,828
Let me see once more!

110
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:36,609
No, I can't. If someone else were\Nto see, it would all fall apart.

111
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,110
Just once more!

112
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,445
{\kf900000}No!

113
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,343
Just show me!

114
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,914
Natasha!

115
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,384
Natasha, are you all right?\NSnap out of it!

116
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,871
You're Eto, right?

117
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,736
That's right, Eto.

118
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,242
Eto, but you are Kakeru as well.

119
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,380
I can't believe it.

120
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,717
I beg you, Natasha. Don't\Nlet anyone learn of this.

121
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,378
But why?

122
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:24,221
A strange feeling would come over\Nme when I was talking to you.

123
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,458
I didn't know why I\Nfelt the way I did.

124
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,562
Kakeru...

125
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,563
Call me Eto. Right\Nnow, I'm not Kakeru.

126
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,833
How come there are now\Ntwo of you, Kakeru?

127
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,800
Because we were defeated by Lucifon.

128
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,469
I came back from the future,

129
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,869
so that the errors made in the\Npast would not be repeated.

130
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,549
But how? How did you\Ndo a thing like that?

131
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,881
I can't reveal that\Nright now. I'm sorry.

132
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,584
But please, keep this a secret\Nbetween just you and me.

133
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,928
I will, Kakeru.

134
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,296
It's Eto.

135
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,763
All right, Eto.

136
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,523
But just answer me one thing.

137
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,496
Does Kakeru love me?

138
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,840
Yes, he loves you very dearly.

139
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,609
For a long time.

140
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,181
Thank you, Kakeru.

141
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,013
I love you, Kakeru. I love\Nyou very dearly as well.

142
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,656
Yes, sure.

143
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,453
I love you, Kakeru!

144
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,659
Natasha, I am not Kakeru right now.

145
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,033
Two individuals cannot occupy the\Nsame time as the same person.

146
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,365
Oh, Kakeru...

147
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:48,174
It's Eto, Natasha. Please, you\Nneed to regain your composure.

148
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:51,769
Kakeru, I love you.\NI love you so much.

149
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,779
Natasha...

150
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,683
Sure is hot.

151
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,313
No ship in sight yet?

152
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,388
Nope.

153
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,991
What is it, Kakeru?

154
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,726
Nothing.

155
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,695
Wait, Kakeru!

156
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,325
It's a ship!

157
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,393
It's a ship!

158
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,565
Everyone! It's a ship! A ship's here!

159
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,725
It's begun moving\Nagain, coming after us.

160
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,939
Eto, I don't intend to help Lucifon.

161
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,842
In fact, I'm intending on doing\Nsomething contrary to his wishes.

162
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,181
Contrary to Lucifon's?

163
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,159
That black stone comes only from a\Nwomb of a woman of the Underworld.

164
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,665
Both Lucifon and I used the black\Nstone to enter into this world.

165
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,801
From the Underworld?

166
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,328
Yes, I am a woman of the Underworld.

167
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,300
You and Kakeru both trace back your\Norigins to the bloodline of the gods.

168
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,880
It would seem we should\Nnot fight together anymore.

169
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,098
Unload our luggage!

170
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,800
There don't seem to\Nbe many people here.

171
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,969
We might have problems\Ngetting warriors here.

172
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,637
Where are the inns?

173
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,104
We'll go look together.

174
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,090
Who is it?!

175
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,296
You are?

176
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:41,255
{\kf900000}Rhea... My sister Helen and I made\N{\kf900000}our escape from the Lucifon forces.

177
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:49,341
I talked to Torheths at the docks,\Nand he told me you were the leader.

178
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,410
Can we join your forces?

179
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,911
Yes, you can.

180
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,311
{\kf900000}My sister Helen can administer\N{\kf900000}healing magic treatments.

181
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,315
I employ a bow.

182
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,318
I see.

183
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,047
I am not a spy!

184
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,789
I don't find you suspicious.

185
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,256
I welcome you.

186
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,824
Show us your best in our fight.

187
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,406
What is it?

188
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,847
Are you adverse to women?

189
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,449
{\kf900000}No, and this has nothing to\N{\kf900000}do with that.

190
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,751
I'm glad. You simply must be tired.

191
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,153
Yes.

192
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:37,384
I understand. Why don't\Nyou take it easy then?

193
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,004
Why?

194
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,703
My mother taught me that I\Nshould service men devoutly.

195
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,285
It's wonderful.

196
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,254
Weren't there men among\NLucifon's forces?

197
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,812
No one normal.

198
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,615
Either they are complete\Npigs, or just simply filthy.

199
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,553
That's fine. You can just\Nlet it loose like this.

200
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,087
This guy looks like\Nhe's ready for more.

201
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,125
You're tired, aren't you?

202
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,065
You don't have to do a thing.

203
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,316
Help me take this off.

204
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,305
You're amazing.

205
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,816
Oh, no...

206
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,148
I can't hold back.

207
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,145
I'm coming!

208
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,609
And I'm good with a bow.

209
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,544
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

210
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,106
That's...

211
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:53,207
Ouch, meow! How dare you say\Nthat? Hitting me like that, meow!

212
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,515
Tanyan...

213
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,355
Kakeru...

214
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,358
What's up?

215
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,861
Oh, about...

216
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,797
That cat girl from before!

217
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,459
Aren't you missing something, Kakeru?

218
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,506
You're the one, aren't you?!

219
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,008
Meow?

220
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,202
{\kf900000}Knock off the meowing.

221
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,646
You picked my talisman from me!

222
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,147
Give it back, now!

223
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,516
{\kf900000}Meow? I have meow clue!

224
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,643
I don't know anymeowing about it!

225
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,954
What are talking about, meow?!

226
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,457
Why, you little runt!\NHold it right there!

227
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,759
Meow, meow! What are you doing, meow?!

228
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,226
Where did you hide it!

229
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,763
How would I mya-know?!\NStop it, meow!

230
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:48,699
That's a special talisman Natasha\Ngave me! It's precious to me!

231
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,602
Damn it, give it back!

232
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:55,407
Enough already, meow! Meow,\Ndon't take off my clothes.

233
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,967
What if I don't have it, meow?

234
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,767
What's going to be your\Npenalty, meow?!

235
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,673
Well...

236
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:06,315
If you really don't have it, then\Nwe'll let you have the talisman.

237
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:11,018
Whatcha sayin' meow?! I don't want\Nanything I already have, meow!

238
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,425
I want somethin' else, meow!

239
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,892
Something else?

240
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,928
Hey?!

241
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,597
Meow?

242
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,201
You just said you had it!

243
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,795
You said it! You did take it from me.

244
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,539
Meow!

245
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,335
{\kf900000}Kakeru!

246
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,108
What are you doing?

247
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,405
{\kf900000}Oh, Natasha.

248
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,412
Who is that child?

249
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,646
{\kf900000}Meow!

250
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,511
Hey! Come back!

251
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:41,016
Something dingy like this is\Nyour precious treasure, meow?

252
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,954
I got no time for poor\Npeople like you, meow!

253
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,793
Kakeru...

254
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,772
So this is...

255
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,000
{\kf900000}The Dragons' Bastion...

256
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,907
We were driven back\Nhere the last time.

257
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,346
Easy there, easy!

258
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,082
Wait! Don't do anything!

259
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:23,044
Hear me, humans. You do\Nnot belong here.

260
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,390
Leave this place immediately!

261
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,188
All we ask is to rest for one night.

262
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,588
This is the sacred Dragons' Bastion!

263
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,653
Humans go home!

264
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,234
Well, you're a human\Ntoo, aren't you?!

265
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:39,169
What's a human child doing\Nin the Dragons' Bastion?

266
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,640
Screw Lucifon's armies!

267
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,141
Go home! Get out!

268
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,443
{\kf900000}We are not part of Lucifon's armies!

269
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,411
We fight them!

270
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:55,212
Heed, humans. If you leave right\Nnow, no harm will come to you.

271
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,384
Nor do we wish to have\Nharm come to you.

272
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,561
All we ask is to rest briefly.

273
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,189
We are all tired from battling\Nthe forces of Lucifon.

274
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,491
You may not!

275
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,901
Wait! Among us is...

276
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,093
Natasha?

277
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,935
Seil...

278
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,300
Wow, you're pretty!

279
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,075
Lord Dragon Knight?!

280
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:15,295
Dear Elder! Your health will suffer\Nneedlessly venturing out like this.

281
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:31,177
Is your father Lord Burn?

282
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,527
As prescribed by the ancient alliance,\Nmy tribe shall

283
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:46,896
henceforth fight along side our\NDragon Knight!

284
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,740
So Seil really was the Dragon Knight.

285
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,229
{\i1} {\i}\NEto...

286
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,230
{\kf900000}Yes?

287
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,722
Are you sure Seil's okay? I\Nwonder what he's doing right now?

288
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:28,573
Don't worry. He'll join us as soon as\Nhe gets the hang of riding on dragons.

289
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:33,033
But we're talking about Seil. I'm\Nguessing he's wailing right about now.

290
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,155
We'll take a break once\Nwe get past this pass.

291
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,338
The mountain-side must've collapsed.

292
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,240
Making it over this isn't\Ngoing to be easy.

293
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,470
Artillery, have the cavalry help you.

294
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,176
Time for action, sappers!

295
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,810
This is a trap! Keep your guard up!

296
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,721
Nereid!

297
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,492
Bastards don't fight fair!

298
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,403
This isn't good!

299
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,071
{\kf900000}They've cut off our rear!

300
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,538
We're surrounded!

301
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,465
Did this happen before as well?

302
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:33,724
People who won't give\Nup on their dreams

303
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:44,464
They all have a bright\Nglitter in their eyes

304
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:52,072
Together with you, someday I wish

305
00:30:52,951 --> 00:31:03,661
We'll take off flying\Ntoward realizing our dreams

306
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:10,969
No matter how tough it\Nis, I'll be with you

307
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:17,942
So don't let things bother\Nyou, let me know everything

308
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:25,717
Between the two of us, we\Ncan share any suffering

309
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:33,157
Your wings shine\Nwith vivid radiance

310
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:44,269
As they beat through the air,\Naiming into the sky, flying free

311
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:51,609
Anybody, as long as\Nthere's something precious

312
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:57,682
They hold dear to their heart

313
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:06,351
Then they'll always shine\Nthrough any day or time

314
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,858
{\kf900000}Next Episode

315
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:45,625
I wonder how many times\NEto has confronted Lucifon?

316
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:51,436
Each and every one of them must\Nhave passed on to the next Kakeru,

317
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:55,673
the next Eto, great\Nanger and deep anguish,

318
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,976
before they then disappeared.

319
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,677
To break from this endless closed\Ncycle of history, Marlene,

320
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:02,202
it will take you to do it.

321
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:08,283
Next and final Dragon Knight: Eternal!
