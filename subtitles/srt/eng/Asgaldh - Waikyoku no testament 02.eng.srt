1
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:11,732
As a demon hunter...

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,367
I was hired by the chief of
a small village called Tylling.

3
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:19,004
There, I met Alicia, who was
being chased by monsters.

4
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:22,475
- Are you all right?
- Y- yes.

5
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:26,685
Father, Ash has already saved me.

6
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:29,252
Oh! Thank you!

7
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:32,922
Came to get killed, monsters!?

8
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:42,262
Let me go!

9
00:01:33,488 --> 00:01:34,716
Damn it!

10
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:36,115
Take this!

11
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:37,691
Combine Powers!

12
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:01,080
I thought this was going to be
an easy job, but I was wrong.

13
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:07,118
I was involved in an event that would
shape the future of Sid Continent!

14
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,347
He... he's a
powerful monster, Nagi!

15
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,414
Who are you!?

16
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:45,284
Amon.

17
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:51,733
The mortals call me the Fire Demon
of the Lords of Darkness.

18
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,898
I don't know
who you are, but...

19
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:58,439
how dare you set the village
on fire, you bastard!!

20
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,201
Why did you do this?

21
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:04,573
To exterminate the humans
from Sid Continent.

22
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:07,910
What the hell are you
talking about, you pyro!?

23
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:10,977
Don't you understand
the consequences...

24
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:13,953
when you talk to me like that?

25
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:15,720
He's coming, Elliege!

26
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:28,795
Take this!

27
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,828
Hot! Hot! Hot!

28
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:04,972
Let go!

29
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:24,550
Normal weapons won't phase him!

30
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:27,357
Elliege! Nagi!

31
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:32,359
What are you doing, Elliege!?

32
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:33,798
Ash!

33
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,439
This is not the time to be gawking!

34
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:46,672
He suddenly showed up and turned
the whole village into flames!

35
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:49,375
He burned my clothes too!

36
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,112
Another monster?

37
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,954
What would you do
if I were?

38
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,188
Ain't that obvious!?

39
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:08,594
Ash!

40
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:18,110
It's useless.

41
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:22,440
The attacks aren't working!

42
00:05:43,304 --> 00:05:45,295
That emblem on her chest!

43
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,099
Is this one Alicia?

44
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,278
Are you after Alicia too?

45
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:54,081
It wasn't just Briggan?

46
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:57,316
What?
You know Briggan?

47
00:05:57,885 --> 00:05:59,546
We finished him off!

48
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:01,013
You defeated Briggan!?

49
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:05,252
We destroyed the
Pillar of Light with him!

50
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:09,561
Defeated by humans...
How pathetic.

51
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:13,191
Well... He did leave me
some amusement, I guess.

52
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:22,075
W... wait!

53
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:26,172
Let me award you
for defeating Briggan.

54
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,558
He's one of the Lords of Darkness
as Briggan was...

55
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,431
but he's no comparison!
That Amon!

56
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:52,973
This is beyond the job
of a monster hunter!

57
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:57,677
What is happening
on this continent?

58
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,209
To get any answers,
we have to save Alicia at once!

59
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:05,514
But we don't know
where Amon is.

60
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,511
I have an idea
where he might be.

61
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:12,860
A traveler who came over
the Mountain of Fire had said...

62
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,793
he saw an ominous manor
at the banks of Meda.

63
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:17,888
At the banks of Meda...

64
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:21,162
It is a manor that did not exist
until Amon appeared.

65
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:22,564
That's got to be it!

66
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,538
But Ash! If we go now, we'll be in
the same situation as we were earlier.

67
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:30,869
You're right, and I won't be at ease
until I find a stronger weapon!

68
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:35,214
I would like a skilled blacksmith
to forge my new sword.

69
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:39,512
Then you should visit
the town of Selenis.

70
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,951
Selenis?

71
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:46,186
There are skilled blacksmiths and
an array of weapons and armor there.

72
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:47,687
Let's do it!!

73
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:50,992
Only a rifle that can shoot a
demon slaying bullet is our hope!

74
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:53,624
Yes. There's no point in going
if we can't fight.

75
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,531
That will take too much time.

76
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:58,795
Then why don't we split
into two groups?

77
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,601
It seems that's the only way.

78
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:05,369
Noooo!

79
00:08:16,557 --> 00:08:19,720
Why is Lavialos
interested in you?

80
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:23,493
You look like
an ordinary girl to me.

81
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,090
No!

82
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,892
Stop!

83
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:33,170
I want to see
what kind of powers you hide.

84
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:34,639
I don't know!

85
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:38,075
I don't know anything
and I don't have any powers!!

86
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:39,877
Really.

87
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:01,963
Nooo!!

88
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,638
Show me the emblem once more!

89
00:09:19,053 --> 00:09:22,147
Come on.
The fun has just begun.

90
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:25,492
No...

91
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:35,429
Stop...

92
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:48,878
Stop!!

93
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:55,982
I've finally got her!!

94
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:05,558
Looks like we'll be able to get
weapons and armor here.

95
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:07,563
I want to catch up to the others.

96
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:10,967
Do what you need to do and
let's meet back here in an hour.

97
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:13,063
- Got it!
- In an hour then!

98
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:23,075
Well... A couple of hands
won't hurt.

99
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:28,455
The ones that defeated
Master Briggan are here...

100
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:30,490
getting weapons and armor.

101
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:34,491
Perhaps to save Alicia, who was
captured by Master Amon.

102
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:38,256
No matter what weapon or armor
the humans may equip...

103
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:40,197
they will not be able
to defeat Amon.

104
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:44,464
Punish those who
oppose our Demon Clan!

105
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:47,306
Yes. There shall be
no need to trouble you...

106
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:50,275
Mistress Lucretia, one of
the Four Lords of Darkness.

107
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:52,513
- Savia!
- Yes ma'am!

108
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,172
The mortals have decided to call us
the Four Lords of Darkness.

109
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:59,549
Do not think I am the same
as Briggan or Amon!!

110
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:02,418
But of course, my lady.

111
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:07,290
Well, we're here at Amon's manor,
but how should we attack?

112
00:11:07,728 --> 00:11:11,357
What are you saying, Ash?
There's no point in strategizing now!

113
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,098
Here we are, so we should just
go ahead and take the orthodox route!

114
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:16,635
The orthodox route?

115
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:18,705
- Open up, Amon!
- Hey!!

116
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:20,433
Give us Alicia back!

117
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,009
Hey, you guys!
It's not that simple...

118
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:35,881
What did I say?

119
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:47,298
Where's Alicia!?

120
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:49,762
Damn pesky humans!

121
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,800
Sit there and watch!!

122
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:06,178
Let me go, you imbecile!

123
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:13,650
F... Fromage...

124
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:18,459
How shall I deal with you...

125
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:32,536
Stop it!

126
00:13:12,353 --> 00:13:13,581
Damn it.

127
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:41,248
Ash!

128
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:43,378
Alicia.

129
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:46,317
I can't even get near him!

130
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:49,247
Let's combine our powers
and fight together!

131
00:13:49,857 --> 00:13:51,347
Alicia.

132
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:59,089
Oh! You still had
some strength left.

133
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:04,737
Say your prayers!

134
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:06,798
Don't make me laugh!

135
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,899
We won't be able to defeat him.

136
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,773
Don't worry. Trust me.

137
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:15,238
Burn to a crisp!

138
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:38,026
What!?

139
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:50,379
This power...

140
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:17,744
What just happened?

141
00:15:22,283 --> 00:15:24,877
Selenis is a lively town.

142
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:27,179
I wonder where they are?

143
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:30,848
Elliege is going to be so surprised
when we tell her we defeated Amon.

144
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:34,455
No doubt about it!
It's their comrades!

145
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:37,291
We've got to report this to Savia!

146
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:40,258
Elliege is probably here.

147
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,671
Have you seen
a girl gambler around?

148
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,905
Girl gambler?

149
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:50,803
She has chestnut brown hair
and wears a gun belt.

150
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:54,574
She was taken away
by Lucretia's soldiers.

151
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:56,673
Lucretia? Who's that?

152
00:15:56,784 --> 00:15:59,218
I'll tell you, Ash.

153
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:03,720
Long time no see, Ash.

154
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:06,954
You had an acquaintance
in this town?

155
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:08,722
She's not just an acquaintance.

156
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:11,862
Ash is my dear little brother.

157
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:14,125
You're Ash's sister!?

158
00:16:14,235 --> 00:16:16,362
We're not related by blood though.

159
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,906
She's more of a pain in the ass.

160
00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:23,475
It's good to see you too.

161
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:28,413
Anyway, do you know about
Elliege and the others, Savia?

162
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:32,611
Don't be so hasty, Ash.
Let's celebrate our reunion.

163
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,687
Savia!

164
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:37,321
Don't worry.
Your friends are fine.

165
00:16:44,598 --> 00:16:47,567
To our reunion!

166
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:49,961
Cheers!

167
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,172
Savia.
What kind of child was Ash?

168
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:06,219
Let's see. Ash was...

169
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:09,248
What's wrong, Tanya?

170
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:12,348
I'm getting really sleepy.

171
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,160
Me too.

172
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:17,190
So am I.

173
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:18,656
Savia!

174
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:21,234
You're still green, Ash.

175
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,929
You bitch.

176
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:40,710
What are you staring at!

177
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:46,755
Why don't I make you all
a really yummy, rich dish?

178
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:52,587
I think their dinner is us!

179
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:07,708
H- hey wait!!
What're you guys thinking!!

180
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:13,242
Are we going to be the
subjects of their amusement?

181
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:18,187
No, I don't want to!

182
00:18:22,463 --> 00:18:24,021
Fa-Fa, are you all right!?

183
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:26,800
I don't think this is the time
to worry about others!

184
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:30,035
Stop it! Don't touch me!!

185
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:49,723
Fa-Fa.

186
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:51,115
Open the gates!

187
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:54,676
My Lady Savia is here to have an
audience with Mistress Lucretia!!

188
00:20:09,002 --> 00:20:10,094
Have you brought them?

189
00:20:10,404 --> 00:20:12,964
Yes. You can see the girl is Alicia.

190
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:16,600
The other one is Ash, who has slain
Master Briggan and Master Amon.

191
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:36,823
Are you Lucretia!?

192
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,455
Ash! But you drank
the sleep potion!

193
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,762
You're the one who's green!

194
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:44,501
Thanks for bringing me here!

195
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:47,129
Now, release my comrades!

196
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:51,141
They just had the time of
their lives with my demons.

197
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:53,372
What!?

198
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,506
Ash!
Stop defying Mistress Lucretia!

199
00:20:57,518 --> 00:21:01,113
Serving guys like them!?
It's not like you!!

200
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:04,418
Brother and sister killing each other
is one form of entertainment...

201
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:06,356
Savia! Kill him!

202
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:08,650
But...

203
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:27,910
Hey, Savia...

204
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:36,620
What are you doing?
We're not kids anymore!

205
00:21:36,723 --> 00:21:38,281
You can't beat me!

206
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:44,793
She's my opponent!!

207
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:00,372
My body...

208
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:02,441
won't move!

209
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:05,852
Savia!

210
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:13,352
What!?

211
00:22:16,797 --> 00:22:17,991
Stop!

212
00:22:18,665 --> 00:22:21,828
Saviaaaa!

213
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:54,366
Ash.

214
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:57,700
Sis.

215
00:23:01,508 --> 00:23:04,807
It's been awhile since
you called me that.

216
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:11,083
I wish I met you not as a sister...

217
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:21,592
My lady!!

218
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,990
How were you able to move!?

219
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm not going to forgive you.

220
00:23:30,771 --> 00:23:32,033
You should be honored that...

221
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:34,972
a mere human like you
shall die by my sword!

222
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:36,734
Why are you doing this?

223
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,178
What does the Demon Clan want?

224
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:41,005
Why are you after Alicia!?

225
00:23:42,282 --> 00:23:45,945
A lowly human like you would not
understand even if I told you!

226
00:23:46,286 --> 00:23:52,225
We shall erase your foolish race
from this continent!

227
00:23:55,996 --> 00:23:57,827
This is?

228
00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:59,391
You!

229
00:24:07,374 --> 00:24:09,103
You're awake.

230
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:10,176
Alicia.

231
00:24:15,215 --> 00:24:19,515
Lucretia. I can't have you
defeated too.
