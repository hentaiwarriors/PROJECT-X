1
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:14,701
It is a turbulent age of war...

2
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:17,740
I have infiltrated
the Takigawa territory...

3
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:20,373
...in order to steal our
enemy's hidden treasure.

4
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:24,514
There is a reason why someone like
myself, completely unskilled in the...

5
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:27,657
...martial arts has been chosen
to take on such a daunting task.

6
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:31,587
I happen to have one asset, one
area in which I have no parallel.

7
00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:33,486
That area is...

8
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:35,854
Seduction!

9
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:40,198
I have risked my life to bring two female
ninjas from the enemy's side to climax.

10
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:44,070
In this way I obtained two fragments
of the map of the hidden treasure.

11
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:03,493
There is another reason why
I entered enemy territory.

12
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:06,387
I am on a mission to find
my adopted sister Sayo...

13
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,259
...who was kidnapped ten years ago.

14
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:21,337
At the time, I never imagined
that Sayo was in the custody of...

15
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:23,572
...none other than Muhousai Tenni...

16
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:26,917
...the man responsible for
the magic of the tattoo maps...

17
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:47,097
I still have no clue as
to Sayo's whereabouts.

18
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:48,728
I have to do something, that I do.

19
00:01:57,548 --> 00:02:00,039
W-What the hell is going on?

20
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:03,981
How lovely!

21
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:08,556
And what a sweet and wonderful smell!

22
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:15,632
I feel really good...

23
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:26,209
Since you defeated both
Kochou and Shirohebi...

24
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:28,607
...I was expecting
a formidable opponent.

25
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:29,872
You've dashed my hopes!

26
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:33,874
Oh my, yet another babe!

27
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:39,517
I guess your eyesight hasn't been
impaired by the spell I cast on you!

28
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:48,095
Hm? Rain?

29
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:54,103
It felt so good, I couldn't help myself...

30
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,339
Y-You've got a lot of nerve!

31
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:05,438
Such a masculine aroma!

32
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,025
Let me water the flowers...

33
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,563
I can feel the spell fading...

34
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:09,572
It's not fair, you've been enjoying
yourself without me for too long.

35
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:16,976
What a huge one!

36
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,016
I've never had anyone this big!

37
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,449
It's that lovely aroma again!

38
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,088
My job is to control the scent of flowers,
but I can't resist this smell at all!

39
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:31,394
I can't take it anymore...

40
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:35,134
Hurry, take this and
rub it all over my body!

41
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:38,097
Your wish is my command!

42
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:46,113
Something's blocking the entrance.

43
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:49,979
Just take it out and throw it away!

44
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:52,112
Dumplings rather than
flowers, as they say...

45
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:56,287
It's such a shame, though, you've
arranged them so nicely, that you have.

46
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:57,553
I got it!

47
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:02,132
Since that space is occupied,
why don't I just go in from here...

48
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,426
Oh no!

49
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,125
You're too big!

50
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:08,070
Kochou did a fine job of
bearing the strain, that she did.

51
00:05:08,338 --> 00:05:11,068
You don't want to be less
of a ninja than her, do you?

52
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:15,240
O-Of course not, how dare you
compare me to someone like Kochou!

53
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:17,142
The hell with it! Do as you wish!

54
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:18,845
All right, then please excuse me!

55
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,314
Does that hurt?

56
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:28,488
Not at all!

57
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,660
You're doing great, it feels amazing!

58
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,164
I think you might be even
better equipped than Kochou!

59
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,457
Do you mean that?

60
00:06:00,357 --> 00:06:01,517
Unbelievable!

61
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,321
How can your anus be so wet?

62
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,992
That feels so good!

63
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:15,462
My body is bursting with a huge dick!

64
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,904
Oh yes!

65
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:08,119
Collecting the pieces of the map has
been an unexpectedly easy job so far...

66
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:11,260
...but Sayo, where the hell can you be?

67
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:15,024
I guess there's no
use thinking about it.

68
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:22,669
It's been a while since
I slept on a futon.

69
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,002
I'll get some rest tonight,
and resume my quest tomorrow!

70
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:40,083
Who's there?

71
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:41,286
Sayo?

72
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:50,823
It was a dream...

73
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,466
It was nothing but a dream...

74
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,505
I know I'm going to find Sayo,
I'll find her no matter what!

75
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:06,908
Sayo?

76
00:08:08,318 --> 00:08:09,250
Sayo!

77
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:16,349
Sayo!

78
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:28,260
L-I'm sorry, I thought
you were someone else...

79
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:38,509
What's going on here?

80
00:08:42,753 --> 00:08:45,085
You can't move about freely
in your dreams, can you?

81
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:46,313
What?

82
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:00,169
You wretched man!

83
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:03,098
I'll see to it that you get a
big dose of pain before you die.

84
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,008
You filthy worthless creature!

85
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:13,608
I can't move...

86
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:16,078
I can't even do anything
to defend myself!

87
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:19,178
Damn, if only this wasn't a dream...

88
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:22,857
...I could at least fight
my way out of these ropes!

89
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:24,350
Suffer!

90
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:28,154
I have to wake up...

91
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,162
Wait a minute!

92
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:31,826
There's a way, it just might work.

93
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:33,368
It'll be a little embarrassing...

94
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,497
What's this horrible smell?

95
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:39,364
No, it can't be...

96
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:45,873
I did it!

97
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,884
I wet my bed for the first
time in years, that I did!

98
00:09:49,386 --> 00:09:51,547
And it was so uncomfortable I woke up!

99
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:52,752
Phew!

100
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:56,683
That's strange...

101
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,329
She's got to be around here somewhere
to cast spells in her victims' dreams...

102
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:07,265
Who are you?

103
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:11,898
L-I never thought you'd use such a
tactic to wake from your dream.

104
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:16,110
I know! I thought it was pretty
inspired myself.

105
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,980
You are not at all like
the one in my dream!

106
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:29,383
Ever since I was a child, I've been
bullied by men who called me gloomy...

107
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,426
That's why I've hated men all my life.

108
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:40,569
And that's what motivated me to get
through Lord Muhousai's rigorous training.

109
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:43,838
I swore to myself that with these
powers, I'd get my revenge someday...

110
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:45,441
I'd make men suffer at my hands...

111
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,637
So that's why you transformed yourself...

112
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:51,804
...into such a powerful woman
in my dreams and beat me!

113
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:55,277
I feel sorry for you.

114
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:58,452
You've never met a man who
would be kind to you, have you?

115
00:10:58,889 --> 00:10:59,617
What?

116
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,225
I have defeated you in battle.

117
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:07,691
Normally, you would have no
choice but to die by my sword.

118
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:10,357
However, I'm not going to kill you...

119
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:15,663
One night is all I'm asking, I want
you to give me your body.

120
00:11:16,173 --> 00:11:18,573
I swear that I will
not harm you in any way.

121
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:27,374
It feels so good!

122
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:33,487
How could any man be so cruel to a
woman with such superior equipment?

123
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,331
Just like a sweet syrup...

124
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:45,398
No!

125
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:47,936
There's no reason to be embarrassed.

126
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:52,502
Your body is seeking
pleasure, and that's normal.

127
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:54,738
Look, me too!

128
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:59,006
W-What is this?

129
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:04,048
You and I are having intercourse, and
so we can fulfill each other's desires.

130
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:07,421
By feeling compassion
for one another.

131
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,525
Compassion?

132
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:15,127
That's right, I want to bring you
pleasure and make you happy, that I do.

133
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:21,665
That feels so good!

134
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:23,703
I don't know what's
going to happen to me!

135
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,369
Surely one finger is not enough, is it?

136
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,552
I'm being sucked right in, it's like
you're begging me for more and more!

137
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,878
How embarrassing!

138
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:43,991
Wow, my fingers are all the way in!

139
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,290
Ow!

140
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:47,693
Should I stop?

141
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:48,286
No!

142
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:49,990
It hurts, but it feels good!

143
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,568
Don't stop what you're
doing, do it harder!

144
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:54,731
As you wish!

145
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:31,204
I cannot bring myself to beat a woman
with a whip, but I can at least do this...

146
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:36,338
A-Are you all right?

147
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:50,516
So lovely.

148
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:53,252
You are a very beautiful woman!

149
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:20,088
It's so strange.

150
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:26,024
You've been bullied all your life, yet
all you want is to be hurt or tortured.

151
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:28,494
My body just got
conditioned to all that...

152
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:31,534
...but this is the first time I've
ever experienced such tender bullying!

153
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,002
I've now collected four pieces
of the map, only one more to go.

154
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:13,498
But surely it's too much to hope
that my luck will last any longer...

155
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,104
More importantly...

156
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:17,806
Will I be able to find Sayo?

157
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,976
Saotome's spy, this is the end.

158
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:06,024
So you made it, huh?

159
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,994
You did not defeat four
of my disciples for nothing!

160
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:14,996
Which makes you Muhousai Tenni.

161
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:16,530
The one and only!

162
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:22,371
Sayo?

163
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:27,247
Do you two know each other?

164
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:30,679
Sayo, it's me, Matagoro!

165
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,020
Have you forgotten your brother?

166
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:36,019
It's true that I once
had a brother, long ago...

167
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:40,686
But my brother didn't come to save
me when I was being carried of f.

168
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:43,865
Despite his promise that he would
protect me as long as he lives!

169
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:45,559
Sayo...

170
00:16:48,404 --> 00:16:51,237
It's not the tearful reunion
you thought it would be, eh?

171
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:54,538
Sayo, show this man who's the best
swordsman of all the Takigawas.

172
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:56,177
It will be a parting gift
to him before he dies!

173
00:16:56,446 --> 00:16:57,037
Sayo...

174
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:04,014
What's the matter, Sayo?

175
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:07,282
I can't do it...

176
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:09,890
You're getting emotional, eh?

177
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,052
You still need a lot of
training ahead of you!

178
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:13,560
It doesn't matter now.
Get out of the way!

179
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:29,338
I already know that your
mission is to find the map.

180
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:32,474
And how you managed
to defeat my disciples.

181
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:42,089
But your weapon of choice
won't have any effect on me!

182
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:49,730
Die!

183
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:55,631
Lord Muhousai, I'm asking
you in the name of heaven.

184
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:57,600
Please spare this man's life!

185
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:58,741
What?

186
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:09,082
It would do nothing for our clan to
take the life of such a lowly man.

187
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,352
All we have to do is
take the map from him and...

188
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:14,615
...send him off into the wilderness.

189
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:16,887
Are you defying me?

190
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,627
Have you forgotten that it was I who
brought you up for the last 10 years?

191
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:23,464
No, I haven't forgotten that debt!

192
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:27,662
Still, that man is my only
brother, he's important to me!

193
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:28,868
Shut up!

194
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:31,133
I'm going to kill him now!

195
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:37,644
You feel that strongly about this man.

196
00:18:42,518 --> 00:18:43,644
Thank God...

197
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:51,726
So naÏÏve of you, Sayo!

198
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:54,989
You might have surpassed me in
swordsmanship, but don't forget that...

199
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:58,294
...I have the wisdom that comes with
having lived for more than 100 years!

200
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:03,505
You know what to expect what
happens to those who betray me...

201
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,866
Die!

202
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:11,570
My brother!

203
00:19:26,396 --> 00:19:28,091
Brother, are you all right?

204
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:30,192
It's just a scrape, that it is.

205
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,857
We'll have to take
care of that right away!

206
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:32,832
Sayo...

207
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:42,903
Thank you, for still being alive...

208
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:46,843
Brother...

209
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:52,783
Let's go home together,
Father is waiting for you, too.

210
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:56,319
You haven't changed,
even after ten years.

211
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:58,519
You did come to save me after all!

212
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:01,158
I see you're still a crybaby!

213
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:02,356
Brother!

214
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:08,236
Still, I feel a little
bitter, that I do...

215
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:09,299
What?

216
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:14,507
Well, I know I should be
happy because I found you, but...

217
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,669
...I only had one more person to go!

218
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:20,542
Just one more piece of the map, and
I could've found the secret treasure!

219
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:24,585
Brother, you can rest assured, you can
obtain that piece any time you want!

220
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,587
Hey, don't make it sound so simple.

221
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:28,518
I've just been lucky
until now, that I have.

222
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:32,560
Next time I go into enemy territory, there's
no guarantee that I'll come back alive.

223
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:37,523
There's no need for you to go
into Takigawa territory anymore.

224
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,235
The last person you're
looking for is right here!

225
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:40,961
Huh?

226
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:56,748
I have been waiting
for this day for years...

227
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:58,042
Sayo...

228
00:20:58,154 --> 00:20:58,984
I love you!

229
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:00,111
I love you, too!

230
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:25,311
That tickles...

231
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:42,957
Oh, not there...

232
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:50,030
Don't worry, I will not cause
you any pain or suffering!

233
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:50,969
All right!

234
00:22:10,726 --> 00:22:13,718
Sayo, you won't believe
what's going on down here!

235
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,830
No, how embarrassing!

236
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:20,994
Don't hold back, it's all
right if you raise your voice.

237
00:22:21,103 --> 00:22:23,094
There's no one here but us!

238
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:26,742
My whole body's starting to
tingle, it feels kind of strange!

239
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:28,806
Y-You're doing great!

240
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,976
So this is your...

241
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,789
Starting from today, it's yours,
Sayo, do as you will with it!

242
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:49,591
You're doing a good
job, it feels so good!

243
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,808
Do you think it's time?

244
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:02,805
What?

245
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:07,314
For us to become one,
that's what I meant.

246
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:21,595
That feels so good!

247
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,965
My body's going to melt away...

248
00:23:38,314 --> 00:23:40,509
I'm burning!

249
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:43,344
It's like I'm burning up inside!

250
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:48,289
You're the best woman I've ever had!

251
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:57,723
Your huge thing is banging
me all the way inside!

252
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:00,199
Inside my body...

253
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:18,075
It feels so good!

254
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,744
I'm tingling all over!

255
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:21,846
Sayo, I'm going to come pretty soon...

256
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,756
Then come, come inside me, all of it!

257
00:24:45,114 --> 00:24:48,413
I'm sorry to make you do that...

258
00:24:48,884 --> 00:24:51,318
Brother, you are wounded.

259
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,414
Anyway, I'm probably better at this
since I've been trained as a ninja!

260
00:24:57,093 --> 00:24:58,151
That's true...

261
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:01,187
But you have to stop
calling me "Brother."

262
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,460
You are now the wife of Matagoro.

263
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:07,428
Yes, Matagoro!

264
00:25:18,948 --> 00:25:20,848
All right, I'm going to open the door...

265
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:27,087
What the hell's going on?

266
00:25:27,189 --> 00:25:28,281
I don't know...

267
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:30,414
What the hell?

268
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:40,593
What is going on?

269
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:46,905
Are these women the
hidden Takigawa treasure?

270
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:53,247
It's possible that they might be
what they call "Living Rewards"...

271
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:55,475
...which were given to valiant soldiers.

272
00:25:56,452 --> 00:25:59,478
My master, please come
over here and caress me!

273
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:01,686
Master!

274
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,486
W-Who wants a treasure like this?

275
00:26:04,427 --> 00:26:07,487
As long as I have you, I
don't need anything else!

276
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,222
Do you really mean that?

277
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:12,391
You never know,
someday you too might...

278
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:14,628
That will never happen,
I'm sure it won't happen!

279
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:15,963
Um, maybe...

280
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:18,197
Master!

281
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:19,569
Master!

282
00:26:20,176 --> 00:26:21,507
Wait for us!
