1
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,599
This is Kazama.

2
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,803
This is Kubota from Panasony Records.

3
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:09,804
Yeah, hi.

4
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:13,374
It's about our new idol singer,
Ryoko Nishimura.

5
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:16,366
How's the song coming?

6
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,478
 

7
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,605
Uh, well...

8
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:20,815
 

9
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:24,182
It's not ready yet.
I can't seem to get the right image.

10
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:28,022
 

11
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:31,480
I was wondering if I could
meet her alone, once.

12
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,493
 

13
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,830
No problem, if that's what it takes.

14
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,264
I'll send her over.

15
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,060
Okay.

16
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,335
 

17
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,003
Oh, one more thing.

18
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:46,530
Have you got the title yet?
I'm writing the press release.

19
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,575
 

20
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,736
The title?

21
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:50,644
 

22
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,635
I've got it right here.

23
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:56,851
 

24
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,286
<i>I'm in Love With a Statue.</i>

25
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,955
<i>I'm in Love With a Statue?</i>

26
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:04,789
Sounds good! Thanks a lot.

27
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,959
 

28
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,688
Bye.

29
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:12,266
 

30
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:18,136
When Idols Fall Prey to Lady Luck

31
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:19,140
 

32
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,303
I'm Tsurujiro Kazama, 28 years old.

33
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:22,977
 

34
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:26,469
I'm a pop music composer, on the way up.

35
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:27,047
 

36
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:30,551
I write debut songs
for new idol singers.

37
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:35,784
Overworked and under incredible
pressure, I have only one relief.

38
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:39,994
 

39
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,121
That girl.

40
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:42,696
 

41
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,632
Akiyo Yoshizawa!

42
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:47,931
You're as beautiful as my first love!

43
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:54,708
 

44
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,076
Who is it?

45
00:02:56,076 --> 00:03:00,414
Mr. Kazama? My debut is next month.
I'm Ryoko Nishimura.

46
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,405
My manager said I should come by.

47
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:09,123
 

48
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:11,284
Right. Come in.

49
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:13,427
 

50
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,019
Take off your clothes.

51
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:26,106
 

52
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:29,610
How do you want to finish,
from the front or back?

53
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,737
Whatever you like.

54
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:36,750
 

55
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,375
Back!

56
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:52,666
 

57
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,470
What a dirty mind, watching
those girls while you work.

58
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,542
It's not like that! I only found out
after I got the place.

59
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,976
I'm not that kind of guy.

60
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:06,146
 

61
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:10,551
Do you always sleep with
the girls before their debut?

62
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:14,419
Not at all! You were just too charming.

63
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:14,722
 

64
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:18,214
Come off it! I mean, look at this room.

65
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:24,565
 

66
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:28,102
I just prefer girls at their peak.

67
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:32,006
At 18 or 19, a girl's hormones
are out of balance.

68
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:33,741
She still has her baby fat.

69
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:39,008
A college sophomore is just right!
That slim body...

70
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:39,380
 

71
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,815
What's with the uniform?

72
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:45,615
The college sold them at a festival,
so I picked one up.

73
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:46,186
 

74
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,689
But it's secondhand.

75
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,816
So much the better.

76
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:53,460
 

77
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,830
Complete with rips and scorch marks.

78
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,163
It has the true-life smell
of a real college co-ed!

79
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:08,542
 

80
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,843
This is Kazama.

81
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,545
This is Sownee records.

82
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,615
How's the song coming
for Omoe Kunitachi?

83
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:18,552
Well, I can't quite get the right image.

84
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:22,222
I was wondering if I could
see her alone, once.

85
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,557
Okay, bye.

86
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:28,796
You framed this one.
Do you really like this type of girl?

87
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,957
Don't touch that!

88
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:37,237
 

89
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,434
Sorry, I didn't mean to be so rough.

90
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:41,508
 

91
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,000
She's very important to me.
She's just like my first love.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,580
 

93
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,107
My love for her is a pure,
platonic love!

94
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:52,519
 

95
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,419
That's all. You can go, now.

96
00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:23,283
 

97
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,285
No! I can't!

98
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:28,049
This is a pure, platonic love!

99
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:32,793
 

100
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,920
My first love!

101
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,799
 

102
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,426
Tsurujiro!

103
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:46,273
 

104
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,400
Akiyo!

105
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:59,319
 

106
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,955
Akiyo stopped coming
to the campus.

107
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:05,893
I don't know why,
but she was suddenly transferred,

108
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,328
But I still see her every day...

109
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,664
across from the campus.

110
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:14,735
She lives in the apartment
complex beyond the river.

111
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:18,672
Rivers have always
symbolized the flow of love.

112
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:23,343
They say a couple separated by
a river is easily reunited.

113
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,346
Yes! Akiyo Yoshizawa and me!

114
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,974
We'll meet on the left bank!

115
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:39,927
 

116
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,361
For just a kiss!

117
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,728
Perhaps just to meet and say hello!
I could die for that!

118
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:46,700
 

119
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,998
No luck today, either!

120
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:50,304
 

121
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,933
Why? Why has Lady Luck
turned against me?

122
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:58,779
 

123
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:02,216
I'm Masako Ishikawa,
I debuted last month.

124
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,514
My manager said I should come by.

125
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:07,788
 

126
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,313
What do you sing?

127
00:08:10,313 --> 00:08:10,557
 

128
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,092
Oldies.

129
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:16,396
Figures. You'll have to practice
very hard to be a good singer!

130
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,331
Yes, sir!

131
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,399
Okay, go on home.

132
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,525
But I...

133
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:21,702
 

134
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,067
Christ!

135
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:32,346
 

136
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,447
Yeah?

137
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:34,648
Oh, Kume!

138
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,417
You've been promoted to Director?

139
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,353
Really?

140
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,422
You want me to appear
on "Reunited Lovers"?

141
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,185
I'll be there!

142
00:08:44,185 --> 00:09:14,388
 

143
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,456
I'll see my first love again!

144
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,960
Suddenly, I'm filled with energy!

145
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,464
I may have missed Akiyo,
but luck must be guiding me.

146
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,591
Lady Luck is right!

147
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:38,278
 

148
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,147
I'll see my first love again!

149
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:44,379
I'm sorry I missed Akiyo,
but this makes up for it!

150
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:46,153
 

151
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:50,290
Now, Mr. Kazama,
hand the bouquet to your first love!

152
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,784
If you've chosen correctly,
she'll accept the flowers.

153
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:56,096
 

154
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,032
But all of them are so beautiful!

155
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:02,102
Will he pick the right one?

156
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,538
At last! It's been so long.

157
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:05,806
 

158
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:10,334
You were the inspiration
for all my songs!

159
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:13,814
 

160
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,975
Then...

161
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:17,117
 

162
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,881
I'm sorry. It's you, isn't it?

163
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:22,189
 

164
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,350
Then it's you!

165
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,192
 

166
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,526
Is it you?

167
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,129
You?

168
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,132
Look at that body!
It must be you!

169
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,535
Mr. Kazama is only speaking
to the cute girls!

170
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,868
What a wretched thing
man's memory is!

171
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:39,473
 

172
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:43,170
And it finally comes
down to just one girl!

173
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,911
 

174
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:49,871
Kazama! I never knew
how much you loved me!

175
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:55,555
 

176
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,386
It can't be!

177
00:10:57,386 --> 00:10:59,159
 

178
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,228
It must be a mistake!

179
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:04,064
My first love can't be that ugly!

180
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,566
I wish you were dead!

181
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,261
Please stand by.

182
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:23,950
 

183
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,385
Who is it?

184
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,387
My manager said I should come by.

185
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:31,258
I'm going to debut this month.
I'm Seiko Nakamori.

186
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,593
Is that your real name?

187
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:36,790
No, my real name
is Akiyo Yoshizawa.

188
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,764
 

189
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,925
Hold on a second!

190
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:40,600
 

191
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,835
Akiyo Yoshizawa is
becoming an idol singer!

192
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:48,208
 

193
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,372
How could this happen?
Should I have sex with her?

194
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:53,280
 

195
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,284
No! My love for her
is pure and platonic!

196
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,219
It is!

197
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,743
What should I do?

198
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:01,121
 

199
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,816
What should I <i>do?</i>

200
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:40,260
 

201
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,626
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

202
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:53,039
 

203
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,666
Dammit!

204
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,977
 

205
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,445
Yes! Trust in Lady Luck!

206
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:05,185
 

207
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,345
Please!

208
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:07,687
 

209
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,247
Should I have sex with her?

210
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:20,801
 

211
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,530
NO SEX

212
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,372
 

213
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,533
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

214
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,141
 

215
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,010
Where do you go to school?

216
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,212
Hori no Koshi University.

217
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,544
Okay, take off your clothes.

218
00:13:34,544 --> 00:14:22,996
 

219
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:28,901
When a Virgin Steals a Man
(A Toyama no Benbei Adventure)

220
00:14:28,901 --> 00:15:07,474
 

221
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:10,043
Good morning, President Toyama!

222
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,311
Good morning.

223
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,835
Good morning!

224
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:14,047
 

225
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,116
God, he's gorgeous!

226
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:20,120
They say all men are
created equal, but it's a lie.

227
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,324
When I see those cruel eyes,
I could just scream!

228
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,193
He's young, powerful,
handsome, and influential!

229
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:31,264
What kind of woman could
catch a man like that?

230
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,834
Thanks for loaning me
that <i>Super Warrior</i> game.

231
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:39,372
It's great, isn't it?
Did you get past level 16?

232
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,374
Not a chance.

233
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,344
I always die there!
Game over.

234
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:47,040
Yeah. How do you get past...

235
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,881
 

236
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:50,349
Mr. Toyama! Good morning!

237
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:55,855
 

238
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,255
President's Office

239
00:15:58,255 --> 00:15:59,359
 

240
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,227
Mr. Toyama, good morning.

241
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,559
Good morning, Sakurako.

242
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,865
 

243
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:09,426
I have your schedule for today.

244
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,737
 

245
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:14,607
Your 10:00 meeting is
in the Daichi room.

246
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,007
Lunch is with the head
of the Economic Federation.

247
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:17,377
 

248
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:20,880
At 1:00, you see the French
Ambassador for a charity show.

249
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,550
From 2:00 to 2:30 is free.

250
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,951
At 2:30, you meet with
the Organization of Free States...

251
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:45,405
 

252
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,532
Nakadai!

253
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:48,441
 

254
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,011
Sachiko!

255
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,172
Happy Birthday!

256
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:54,414
 

257
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:55,782
What's this?

258
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:59,853
It's a scarf for your birthday.
I knitted it myself.

259
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,455
Stop it, Sachiko!
I told you we were through!

260
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:05,652
I won't accept this!
Take it back!

261
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:06,659
 

262
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,461
If you don't want it, just throw it...

263
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,430
Tatsuro!

264
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,165
Hitomi!

265
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,299
Sorry I'm late!

266
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,301
I just got here myself.

267
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:19,397
I'll make dinner for us, okay? But...

268
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:20,940
 

269
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:26,037
I'm still taking cooking lessons,
so it might not be very good.

270
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:26,880
 

271
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,817
Don't worry.
I always love everything you cook.

272
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,252
 

273
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,953
You're so nice!

274
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,080
Well, let's go.

275
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,956
 

276
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,959
Let's pick up some
wine on the way home.

277
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,961
Miss Honda! Good night.

278
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:46,332
It'll take a while to finish making the
beef stew.

279
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,967
Don't worry.

280
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,958
- What's this?
- I just got it.

281
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:50,970
 

282
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,736
How ugly. It wouldn't
look any good on you.

283
00:17:54,736 --> 00:18:22,502
 

284
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:26,005
What's wrong, Sachiko?
You look miserable.

285
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:30,310
Sakurako, is there any
fate worse than death?

286
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,513
What's wrong?
This isn't like you.

287
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:37,916
There must be some way to stop her!

288
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:38,184
 

289
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:42,188
I'd like to rip the heart
right out of her body!

290
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,349
I... I...

291
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:46,025
 

292
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,461
What happened, Sachiko?

293
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:52,332
You can tell me, can't you?
We've always been close friends.

294
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,664
She took my boyfriend.

295
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:55,535
 

296
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,095
You can't mean Mr. Nakadai!

297
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:58,705
 

298
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,866
But you're engaged!

299
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:02,342
 

300
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:07,046
Yes, but Hitomi worked with him
in the accounting department...

301
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,173
She took him!

302
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:46,386
 

303
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,547
Nakadai!

304
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:49,455
 

305
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:53,026
He's the only man I've ever been with.

306
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:58,521
And then... he told me
that he'd only marry a virgin!

307
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,098
 

308
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:02,769
It didn't sound like him.
I'm sure it was her doing!

309
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:06,466
He said he liked her innocence.

310
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,607
 

311
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:11,644
It's a lie! She's no virgin!
She's lying!

312
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:12,645
Sachiko!

313
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:17,708
I was hurt and confused,
so I had her investigated.

314
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,117
 

315
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:23,419
She's usually going
with several men at once!

316
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:24,157
 

317
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:26,318
You should tell him!

318
00:20:26,318 --> 00:20:27,794
 

319
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,629
No. I can't.

320
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:30,863
Sachiko!

321
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:37,268
I'm scared that if I tried to tell him,
he'd just hate me more for it.

322
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:41,641
 

323
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:42,875
Sachiko,

324
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:47,312
I know a man who will secretly
rape women, for a fee.

325
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,147
 

326
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,016
I'll introduce you.

327
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,507
You're not joking with me?

328
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:53,519
 

329
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,022
They call him Toyama no Benbei.

330
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,157
Toyama no Benbei?

331
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:03,493
I'll introduce you, but he
won't accept money for his fee.

332
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:05,031
 

333
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,396
You understand?

334
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:09,669
 

335
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,106
Unfortunately, Japan is
naive in world politics.

336
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:17,677
Japan is just like the USA was
after World War I...

337
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:20,179
It had a colossal trade surplus.

338
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:24,050
Then the great depression
of 1929 struck.

339
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,317
Are you saying that we'll
end up like America is now?

340
00:21:29,317 --> 00:21:29,689
 

341
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:31,858
We're the world's largest creditor.

342
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:37,160
We can afford to return some power
to the rest of the world!

343
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,197
 

344
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:42,725
Japan must work for the
betterment of the entire world!

345
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:43,703
 

346
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:47,206
Thank you.
You've helped me immensely.

347
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:51,666
Toyama, I'd like to have these
discussions more often.

348
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,445
 

349
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:55,539
Certainly. You're always welcome.

350
00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:00,720
 

351
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,522
Mr. President?

352
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:06,726
A customer will be waiting
for you at your BMW.

353
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:07,283
All right.

354
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:24,911
 

355
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,139
Get in.

356
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:28,114
 

357
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:31,250
You're Mr. Toyama no Benbei?

358
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,552
Yes.

359
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,254
I heard about you from Sakurako.

360
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:38,451
First, there's the matter of my fee.

361
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:41,761
 

362
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:44,594
You seem to have
the wrong impression.

363
00:22:44,594 --> 00:22:45,264
 

364
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,858
She told you what to bring.

365
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:48,267
 

366
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,361
Is this really all you want?

367
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:52,271
 

368
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,762
I got it from my nephew...

369
00:22:54,762 --> 00:22:56,776
 

370
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,278
The best game in America!

371
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,948
"Dragon Train" from Panic Software!

372
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,610
To think it exists in Japan!

373
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,284
 

374
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:08,481
So you're a game freak?

375
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,456
 

376
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:14,460
Now, Miss Honda,
I've agreed to your request.

377
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,293
Leave this to Toyama no Benbei.

378
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:24,971
 

379
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:27,132
Nakadai is horrible!

380
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:27,807
 

381
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,571
Getting himself sent to Osaka!

382
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:34,113
 

383
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:35,615
What a hunk!

384
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:39,745
Get in. I'll show you
a world made just for two.

385
00:23:39,745 --> 00:23:47,326
 

386
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,828
Excuse me?

387
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:51,998
I'm sorry.
I saw you amidst the skyscrapers.

388
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:55,334
You were so beautiful,
I couldn't help myself.

389
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:58,004
All alone, in a parched
concrete jungle.

390
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:02,168
My heart thirsted for
satisfaction, but no longer!

391
00:24:02,168 --> 00:24:03,342
 

392
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:09,713
You quenched my thirst like
a nymph from an enchanted well.

393
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:12,018
 

394
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:15,354
Even my car drives better,
now that you're here.

395
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,657
It's such a nice car.

396
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,022
Thank you.

397
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:28,434
 

398
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,265
What's your name?

399
00:24:30,265 --> 00:24:30,303
 

400
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,430
Call me Mr. Benbei.

401
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,039
 

402
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,563
Mr. Benbei.

403
00:24:34,563 --> 00:24:35,374
 

404
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:38,866
A toast to your beauty.

405
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:41,380
 

406
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,684
But your car...
is it okay to drink inside?

407
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,276
I don't care!

408
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,053
 

409
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:49,388
Anything for you!

410
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,891
I'd give my life for you!

411
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:52,858
No!

412
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,894
 

413
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:57,697
Your kisses are like heaven!

414
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:01,901
I'm 20 years old,
I've been kissed before.

415
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:04,028
Not there...

416
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:04,770
 

417
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,931
It's so wet!

418
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:08,140
 

419
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,665
I'm 20, I know what to do.

420
00:25:10,665 --> 00:25:13,779
 

421
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:17,306
My bra is... That's my...

422
00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:22,588
 

423
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:25,424
Please! I need you!

424
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:30,828
This storm of cherry blossoms
will transport you to heaven!

425
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:51,384
 

426
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:55,616
Mr. Nakadai, Miss Akimoto, good.
Everyone is here.

427
00:25:55,616 --> 00:25:56,255
 

428
00:25:56,255 --> 00:26:02,023
Miss Honda tells me her fiancé
was stolen by a phony virgin.

429
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:02,695
 

430
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:06,632
A phony virgin?
What are you talking about?

431
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:13,697
Mr. Nakadai, you don't seem
to know who really loves you.

432
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,141
 

433
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:21,046
Last night Miss Akimoto had
passionate sex with another man.

434
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:21,280
 

435
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,915
That's a lie!

436
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,986
According to the man,
they used several exotic positions.

437
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,988
A driving sexual experience.

438
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:33,618
What? Stop it!
She's not that kind of girl!

439
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:34,160
 

440
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,496
It's no joke.
She thoroughly serviced the man.

441
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:39,999
 

442
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:42,001
That's a lie!

443
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,504
You may be the president,
but I won't listen to this!

444
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,506
Apologize to her!

445
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:50,009
Hmm, then Miss Akimoto...

446
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:54,313
You're saying you've never
heard of a Mr. Benbei?

447
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:56,713
I've never met the man!

448
00:26:56,713 --> 00:26:58,017
 

449
00:26:58,017 --> 00:27:00,019
What do you take me for?

450
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,821
Mr. President!

451
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:07,157
Akimoto! Your charms could
ensnare any man!

452
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:07,393
 

453
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:12,990
You could trick almost anyone, but you
can't trick the Toyama cherry blossoms!

454
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,066
 

455
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:18,127
You remember this mark,
don't you, Akimoto!

456
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:26,045
 

457
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:30,277
This storm of cherry blossoms
witnessed everything!

458
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:52,238
 

459
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:55,574
Miss Hitomi Akimoto, you've
disrupted my company's harmony.

460
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:58,244
I'm ordering your immediate dismissal.

461
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,542
That settles the case.

462
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:01,580
 

463
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,707
Yeah! No! No!

464
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:08,087
 

465
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:14,151
Mr. Nakadai and Miss Honda
plan to get married this spring.

466
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:14,326
 

467
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:17,263
Mr. President!
Are you listening to me?

468
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:22,101
I'm listening. What happened
to that bitch, Akimoto?

469
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:26,197
She's claiming to be a virgin
at another company.

470
00:28:26,197 --> 00:28:27,606
 

471
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,275
That's Akimoto, all right.

472
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:34,613
So, Sakurako, how'd you like to
drive out to Yokohama tonight?

473
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:39,618
Sorry, my mother's dying wish
was for me to stay out of BMWs.

474
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:42,488
Oh? When did your mother die?

475
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,012
Guess.

476
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:45,624
 

477
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,750
Dammit!

478
00:28:46,750 --> 00:29:07,313
 

479
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,474
Oh, yes!

480
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:26,532
 

481
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:30,366
Why won't you marry me, Iwata?

482
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:31,604
 

483
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:36,701
Not yet, Tomoko.
I don't earn enough to support a wife.

484
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:37,042
 

485
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:40,978
But once we're married,
daddy can promote you.

486
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:44,683
 

487
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,810
One more time!

488
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,687
 

489
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,245
Kyoko...

490
00:29:50,245 --> 00:29:51,924
 

491
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,791
That's wonderful!

492
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:55,427
 

493
00:29:55,427 --> 00:30:01,332
When a Superior Takes Your Girl
(A Toyama no Benbei Adventure)

494
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:12,444
 

495
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:15,080
Good morning, Kyoko.

496
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,241
Iwata, good morning.

497
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:18,384
 

498
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:23,722
Your eyes are moonlit pools,
your lips are like cherries!

499
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:27,026
Your skin is whiter
than Kilimanjaro's snow.

500
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,394
Oh, Iwata!

501
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,729
You're more beautiful than a rose!

502
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:34,166
Save your flattery for outside,
hot shot.

503
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,035
What?

504
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:39,238
President Toyama! Good morning!

505
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:44,232
Very smooth.
Most men would have at least blushed.

506
00:30:44,232 --> 00:30:45,277
 

507
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:48,804
I'm just sincere, sir.
She really IS that beautiful!

508
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:50,049
 

509
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,540
Such a romantic.

510
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,421
 

511
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:59,491
Mr. President, it's time
for the board meeting.

512
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:02,394
Sorry. Excuse me,
Iwata, Miss Itabashi.

513
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:03,452
Y-yes sir!

514
00:31:03,452 --> 00:31:11,303
 

515
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:15,274
Mr. President, don't meddle
in the affairs of lovers!

516
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:17,401
Hey, that hurts!

517
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:22,448
 

518
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:25,451
I can't believe it! He noticed me!

519
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,612
He's so handsome!

520
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:28,153
 

521
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:33,284
I'm sorry, Kyoko, but I
have to break our date tonight.

522
00:31:33,284 --> 00:31:33,459
 

523
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:37,486
Tomoko Umemoto insists
on seeing me every night!

524
00:31:37,486 --> 00:31:38,797
 

525
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:43,102
I'm afraid I have to
see Mr. Umemoto tonight...

526
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:48,240
That family! They think their rank
lets them rule our lives!

527
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,309
Iwata!

528
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,045
Kyoko, I may not earn much yet,

529
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:56,412
but in a few years I'll make
enough to support both of us!

530
00:31:56,412 --> 00:32:01,186
 

531
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,347
I know I can do it!

532
00:32:03,347 --> 00:32:09,995
 

533
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:14,333
Papa, I want you to fire
Kyoko Itabashi! Right away!

534
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:18,837
I saw her with Iwata again!
She's always getting in my way!

535
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:22,875
Tomoko, what do you see in that gorilla?

536
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,343
He's just great!

537
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:26,512
What's so great about him?

538
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:28,847
It's just that he's so...

539
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,849
...twisted!

540
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,851
What's twisted?

541
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:36,787
I've become his sex slave!

542
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:39,358
 

543
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,360
Papa, please!

544
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,364
Out of the question.
I'm seeing Kyoko, I can't fire her.

545
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:46,465
Papa!

546
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,628
But I might have an idea...

547
00:32:49,628 --> 00:33:01,046
 

548
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,882
Iwata raped your daughter?

549
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:04,883
Yes.

550
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,552
I can't believe it!

551
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,821
I have to think of Tomoko's future.

552
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:14,521
I can't press charges and
still work beside him.

553
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:16,895
 

554
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:20,566
Instead, I'd like YOU
to have him arrested.

555
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:23,402
If you can't, I'll be forced to resign.

556
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:28,533
You can't do that.
Your project would collapse.

557
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:29,408
 

558
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:30,209
Then...

559
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:32,578
All right, I believe you.

560
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:35,914
Iwata will be suspended... for now.

561
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:39,418
I don't quite understand, but... all
right.

562
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,545
Thank you, sir.

563
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:45,424
 

564
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:46,516
Mr. President...

565
00:33:46,516 --> 00:33:48,227
 

566
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:51,390
I don't like Section Chief Umemoto.

567
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:57,469
 

568
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,630
Iwata!

569
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,306
 

570
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:06,073
I'm so happy!
Now we can spend all day like this!

571
00:34:06,073 --> 00:34:11,316
 

572
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,113
Kyoko!

573
00:34:13,113 --> 00:34:26,465
 

574
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:29,525
You said you had something for me?

575
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,469
 

576
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,596
It's nothing much.

577
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:43,282
 

578
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:45,784
I can't believe it!

579
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:49,777
I'm not saying that we
have to live together...

580
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:51,290
 

581
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,657
I can't. I can't accept it.

582
00:34:54,657 --> 00:35:04,002
 

583
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:07,239
What? Why can't you see me today?

584
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:10,242
We haven't seen each other
for three weeks!

585
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:15,314
If I saw you, Umemoto would
just prolong your suspension.

586
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:18,684
So you're only staying away for my sake!

587
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,819
Try to understand, Iwata.

588
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,521
I understand.

589
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:25,824
I'll hold on, just for you, my darling!

590
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,985
Goodbye.

591
00:35:27,985 --> 00:35:35,701
 

592
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:39,102
I don't care if I'm poor or unemployed!

593
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:40,339
 

594
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:43,706
Just as long as you're with me, Kyoko!

595
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:46,712
 

596
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:48,213
Who is it?

597
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:52,309
Tetsuo Iwata, of the
Oedo Production Corporation?

598
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:56,054
 

599
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,590
Don't open the door, just listen.

600
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,058
Who are you?

601
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,426
I'm with the Mossad.

602
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:02,361
The Mossad?

603
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:06,064
You've been suspended, haven't you?

604
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,366
How'd you know?

605
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:10,736
I'm with the Mossad.
I know everything.

606
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:14,072
Is it true that you raped Tomoko?

607
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:16,875
Raped Tomoko? Never!

608
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:20,012
She comes here every day
and uses me for sex!

609
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:23,812
I see. All right, I'll help you.

610
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:29,087
 

611
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,957
Legend of Belda, Legend of Kintaro,

612
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:34,593
Bad Muscles, Treasure of Kabocha...

613
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,094
What is this?

614
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:42,966
Take one of these games
to Azabu sports club at eight.

615
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:43,602
 

616
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:47,299
A man named Toyama no Benbei
will help you.

617
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:48,607
 

618
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,734
Toyama no Benbei?

619
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:57,416
 

620
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,748
Azabu Sports Club

621
00:36:59,748 --> 00:37:26,678
 

622
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,947
Are you Mr. Toyama no Benbei?

623
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:33,077
Mr. Tetsuo Iwata?
Did you bring the merchandise?

624
00:37:33,077 --> 00:37:36,255
 

625
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,457
The Treasure of Kabocha!

626
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,459
I've been briefed by Saku...

627
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:41,448
the Mossad.

628
00:37:41,448 --> 00:37:42,094
 

629
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,829
Who should I rape?

630
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:47,599
Rape? Of course!
Rape Tomoko Umemoto!

631
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,104
Then I can blackmail
Umemoto into releasing Kyoko!

632
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,231
All right.

633
00:37:54,231 --> 00:38:08,687
 

634
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:11,990
You don't know my father!
You lied to me!

635
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,493
Who are you?

636
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:15,960
A gangster!

637
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:36,715
 

638
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,217
Good. Everyone is here.

639
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:42,888
This situation revolves around Iwata.

640
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:48,451
Mr. Umemoto claims that Iwata
raped his daughter, Tomoko.

641
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:48,593
 

642
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:52,085
So I put Mr. Iwata on suspension.

643
00:38:52,085 --> 00:38:52,230
 

644
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,233
It now seems that this was a mistake.

645
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,235
Mr. President...

646
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:58,236
Mr. Iwata?

647
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:01,807
Yes, Tomoko was raped,

648
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:03,172
but not by me!

649
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:03,308
 

650
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,409
Hold it!

651
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:06,411
What's the meaning of this?

652
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:13,180
And unless you want her raped again,
you'll release Kyoko!

653
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,052
 

654
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,687
Iwata, you bastard!

655
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,924
This is just another example
of his blackmail!

656
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:22,260
You should talk!
You screwed me over first!

657
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,061
What?

658
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:27,191
Wait a minute! I was never raped!

659
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:27,265
 

660
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,935
You don't have any proof, do you?

661
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,070
Proof? Well...

662
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,773
See? It was just another lie.

663
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:36,900
Stop telling lies!

664
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,944
 

665
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:41,105
Enough of this talk!

666
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:42,948
 

667
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,282
Mr. President!

668
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:47,786
Tomoko Umemoto! You asked for proof?

669
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:50,220
Then I'll give it to you!

670
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,789
 

671
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,552
Here's your proof!

672
00:39:52,552 --> 00:39:58,830
 

673
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,425
You could never forget this
storm of cherry blossoms!

674
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:05,170
 

675
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,107
So the man who raped me
in the BMW was... the President!

676
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,610
Tomoko, is this true?

677
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:17,276
The two of you conspired
to have Iwata suspended.

678
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:18,817
 

679
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:24,119
Section Chief Umemoto,
you'll have to release Kyoko.

680
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,492
 

681
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:32,452
I have no choice. I don't want anyone
else to know about this.

682
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:33,064
 

683
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:33,999
Hurray!

684
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,227
No!

685
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:36,334
 

686
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,461
Mr. Umemoto!

687
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:39,137
 

688
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:42,004
Not even death can separate us!

689
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:46,344
 

690
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:51,509
My darling Kyoko,
I don't want to lose you, either.

691
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:52,350
 

692
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,020
What is this, Kyoko?

693
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,891
Didn't you ever notice how
much in love they were?

694
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:02,792
That's a lie! Tell her, Kyoko!

695
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:03,862
 

696
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:06,031
Don't you get it yet?

697
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:07,866
What an idiot!

698
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:11,169
Always dreaming, and ignoring
the real world.

699
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,370
Kyoko...

700
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,374
You'd live in poverty,
so long as we were together.

701
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:20,378
There's not a woman alive
who wants that kind of life!

702
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:23,905
I guess I'm not the woman
of your dreams!

703
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:24,549
 

704
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:27,484
I'm sorry, Mr. Romantic Egotist!

705
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:28,186
 

706
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,710
But...

707
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:33,558
 

708
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:39,155
Kyoko, you're the source of
this damaging relationship.

709
00:41:39,155 --> 00:41:39,397
 

710
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:44,636
I can't forgive such a crime,
so I must ask for your resignation.

711
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,071
Of course.

712
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:49,207
Now you can devote
your time to Mr. Umemoto.

713
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:50,572
Mr. President...

714
00:41:50,572 --> 00:41:51,710
 

715
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,645
Iwata...

716
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:56,781
You disgust me.

717
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,579
There are better men out there,
and I'll find one.

718
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,922
 

719
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:07,323
Mr. President, last night
was magnificent!

720
00:42:07,323 --> 00:42:10,428
 

721
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,731
How can this be happening?

722
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:15,757
Just consider it a study in life.

723
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:16,434
 

724
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,925
The case is closed!
