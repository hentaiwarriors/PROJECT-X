1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,170
Really! What's this ghost place?

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,510
It's even hard to find a convenience shop so early

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,690
Wataru...
I'm totally hopeless this time

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,860
What has Katsuya done?

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,450
Kurumi don't want to date with me

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,370
Seem she has someone she love already...

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,910
Maybe it's someone we know...

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,540
Kurumi, you're so lovely

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,840
Wataru...

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,840
Wataru... I wanna die...

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,720
Why Natsuko and Kurumi is just the same?

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,390
Seems like between people,

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,100
the same things happened repeatedly

14
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,480
Especially the relationship between man and woman

15
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,820
Really an unbelievable thing

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,280
At first Katsuya wooed Kurumi

17
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,150
Then Kurumi being nice to Katsuya, but he haven't cherish it

18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,420
And is that I have to think of her all along

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,670
Till the summer ends?

20
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,390
"Doukyuusei ~ The final chapter"

21
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,940
"When summer ends"

22
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,530
Welcome!

23
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,490
Boss, a cup of cold coffee

24
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,120
Today's weather is really so hot

25
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,000
What's wrong? Wataru

26
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,880
Seem you are not very energetic

27
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,670
Are you suffered heatstroke?

28
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,170
No such thing!
You see how strong I am

29
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,680
Really not having a fever?

30
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,150
It's better for you to take rest when you have time

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,730
You don't be too involved.

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,360
Welcome

33
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,720
No need for change

34
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,090
Thanks

35
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,430
Thanks

36
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,560
So great

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,940
He is that kind of man

38
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,650
When women saw him they will think he is very handsome.

39
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,740
And his action is so gentle.

40
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,030
Is that really?

41
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,790
Never thought I'd meet her in this place

42
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,460
I think I won't see her again this summer

43
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,260
From Mai, it's for you

44
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,910
Mai!

45
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,700
Wataru

46
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,420
When I saw you at the coffee shop

47
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,210
I still think that I'm dreaming

48
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,800
Sorry

49
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,640
I wanted to talk with you clearly last time

50
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,470
But I didn't have a chance.

51
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,940
This time, I can meet with you

52
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,650
I really thanks for the arrangement of Got

53
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,740
Thank you, sis.

54
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,120
My dad is very strict looking after me

55
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,380
So he doesn't allow me to get along with friends of other sex.

56
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,720
Then Keinze?

57
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,220
He will go abroad with family soon.

58
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,890
We are just as friends.

59
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,600
Nothing happened at that time

60
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,980
I haven't cheated you

61
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,520
Really!

62
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,110
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

63
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,870
I thought even I've said that.

64
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,450
You wouldn't believe me.

65
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,910
Sorry.

66
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,670
Mai

67
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,550
Don't mention the past anymore.

68
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,760
Let's go to playground together, OK?

69
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,270
But...

70
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,520
Alright?

71
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,690
So great!

72
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,790
The dating time has passed.

73
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,910
What happened with Mai?

74
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,540
Maybe she doesn't want to come?

75
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,040
Wataru

76
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,300
You've waited so long, sorry.

77
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,270
You are Mai?

78
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,600
Since there's a reason,
I have to wear like this

79
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,570
No! I don't mean that.

80
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,490
It's just a little out of expectation.

81
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Then let's go quickly!

82
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,220
Mai?

83
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,520
Don't speak!
They are the staff of my dad.

84
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,390
They come to get you, Mai?

85
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,950
So great, haven't been discovered by them.

86
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,370
But it should be OK being here.

87
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,250
Don't let them destroy our date.

88
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,500
Let us play heartily!

89
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,640
Long time ago,

90
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,310
When I was small...

91
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,900
My dad brought me here to play.

92
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,780
At that time, there were many people waiting down there.

93
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,160
My dad is the boss of here.

94
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,290
What? Your dad is the boss of this playground?

95
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,340
At that time, the ticket staff saw that I was waiting,

96
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,760
so he let me in first.

97
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,300
One time, the one before me was my classmate.

98
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,850
Seeing that I had priory,

99
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,060
his attitude to me changed in to a great degree

100
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,020
My dad also fired the ticket staff.

101
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,150
From then on,
I won't come to playground anymore.

102
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,670
That's not your fault, Mai.

103
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,670
Thank you

104
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,800
Wataru, you're really nice to me.

105
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,680
Mai...

106
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,450
Miss, we come to take you back home.

107
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,370
No!

108
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,750
We come by the order of the director.

109
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,330
No! I won't go back!

110
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:24,830
Get me go!

111
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,000
Wataru!

112
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,000
Mai!

113
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,340
Wataru!

114
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,220
Wataru...

115
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:40,930
Mai!

116
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,730
Wataru!

117
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,570
Mai... Mai!

118
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,080
Disgusting, what nonsense are you talking about?

119
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,750
What's the matter? Wataru

120
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,590
Teacher Senri!

121
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,180
Are you being dumped by a girlfriend?

122
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,770
No... not that...

123
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,810
Seems like you're finding trouble to yourself.

124
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,770
The next semester is coming soon.

125
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,690
Are you energetic to go to school?

126
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,110
Are you OK?

127
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,610
No...

128
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,570
Wataru

129
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,370
You just lack of courage and force in your age.

130
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,210
So have to...

131
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,250
Courage and force...

132
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,720
Thank you! Teacher!
I will work hard!

133
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,760
I gotta go now!

134
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,060
Remember this summer holiday is just 3 days left.

135
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,730
Yes! I know!

136
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,900
Does he really understand?

137
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,570
Only 3 days left, then the summer holiday will end.

138
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,840
Courage and force?

139
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,100
Seems like no one home.

140
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,100
Mai!

141
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,150
What are you here for?

142
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,900
I come to find Mai!

143
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,370
Mai is now forbidden to go out.

144
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,660
You better leave her farther, in order to not getting in trouble.

145
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,870
What?!

146
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,420
Get away!

147
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,630
I'm the bodyguard Mai's parents sent formally.

148
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,920
What are you saying?!

149
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,350
See! This is the evidence!

150
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,430
See it clearly yourself!

151
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,640
Authorization letter?

152
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,110
I hereby authorized Mr. Aihara
Keinze formally.

153
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,110
to take care of Sakuraki Mai's life?!

154
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,490
Then you should understand, right?

155
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,450
You won't be able to be with Mai.

156
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,660
What are you saying?

157
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,750
Mai's everything belongs to me!

158
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,500
Idiot

159
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,260
Little kid! I warn you!

160
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,390
Don't think a plan of Mai!

161
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,260
No such petty gains!

162
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,350
Get away with your tail quickly!

163
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,720
You're really disgusting!

164
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,100
Do you want money?

165
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,480
I ask you if you want money?

166
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,270
Mai is the daughter of a rich family...

167
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,780
Damn it!

168
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,080
No such thing! I treat Mai with my heart!

169
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,370
It hurts! Very painful!

170
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,960
No!

171
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,550
Wataru...

172
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,060
You know my strength now?

173
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,600
Hari! Sair!

174
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,700
Wataru...

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,540
Mai... I must find a way to see you!

176
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,340
Mai

177
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,510
Sorry, there's a little trouble outside.

178
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,930
You've been scared.

179
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,690
So shameless.

180
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,820
He wants to be a hero this way.

181
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,530
Wataru...

182
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,390
Poor people always like doing this.

183
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,810
Man I had to work hard all along without afraid of failure.

184
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,230
Then at last, success will belong to you.

185
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,530
I must not afraid of failure, work hard till the end.

186
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,570
I left my family just because of this!

187
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,740
Mai!

188
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,080
Wataru!

189
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,210
Mai!

190
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,260
Wataru!

191
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,100
Mai...

192
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,230
I want to open the knot in my heart.

193
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,190
I can't stand my dad and the people surround me already.

194
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,940
I... I...

195
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,070
I have to surpass the present me.

196
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,950
Please take me!

197
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,610
Mai...

198
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,490
Mai

199
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,040
Wataru...

200
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,210
Can the light be dimmer?

201
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,000
If I switched of the light, then
I can't see your tempting look.

202
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,250
No

203
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,340
No...

204
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,210
Can't...

205
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,440
Wataru...

206
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,900
Mai, I love you.

207
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,190
I love you too.

208
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,900
Mai...

209
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,030
Wataru, be gentle to me...

210
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,560
No!

211
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,650
What's wrong?

212
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,700
Nothing, but...

213
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,570
Are you shy?

214
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,410
Anything else?

215
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,000
Just shy only...

216
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,680
No!

217
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,210
No... no...

218
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,140
No... no... Wataru...

219
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,210
No!

220
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,420
What's the matter?

221
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,600
It's my first time, sorry...

222
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,350
You said so. Will make me even more excited?

223
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,020
Really?

224
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,780
I am a person who always give others trouble...

225
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,530
Really... silly...

226
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
When it's comfortable.

227
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,620
Open yourself just following your feeling, OK?

228
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,140
Let me... let me feel more, alright?

229
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,380
Wataru, I feel it, very shame...

230
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,090
Wataru!

231
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,620
No... no... Wataru...

232
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,430
So shameful...

233
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,350
No!

234
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,650
No... please don't watch there, very shameful

235
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,240
Your place is very cute, Mai

236
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,490
Don't say it! I'm so shy!

237
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,280
Really

238
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,030
No...

239
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,460
Very shy...

240
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,000
I feel it.

241
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,090
So sore... Wataru...

242
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,050
Enough...

243
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,180
Mai...

244
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,600
Wataru...

245
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,900
Come to me...

246
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,720
Mai...

247
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,640
Wataru...

248
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,320
Are you OK?

249
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,780
I'm very happy

250
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,030
I feel that I'm become one with you.

251
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,240
Mai...

252
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,410
Wataru...

253
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,300
So painful...

254
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,040
Wataru...

255
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,300
Be stronger...

256
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,140
Mai...

257
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,640
I love you... Wataru...

258
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,800
Can I stay here tonight?

259
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:54,640
I'm so happy

260
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,730
I'm going back home first.

261
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,280
Please don't worry about whether my dad will be angry.

262
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,620
I can't meet you before the summer holiday ends.

263
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,370
But, that doesn't matter.

264
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,120
When school starts, we can meet everyday.

265
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,930
I'm late!

266
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,870
As if forgetting the time, spreading out.

267
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,020
Wataru, Misa ask me to say hello to you.

268
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,900
Good morning, Wataru

269
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,400
Good morning...

270
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,880
Seems like I'm going have troubles this semester.

271
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,720
Wataru! Wataru!
