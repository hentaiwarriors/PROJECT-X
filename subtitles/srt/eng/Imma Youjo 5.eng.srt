1
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,835
What are you doing here?

2
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,546
Yes... well, I'm...

3
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:59,377
I was sent by the household
service agency to work here.

4
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,983
Are you the new maid?

5
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:03,820
What is your name?

6
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,021
Y- Yes! My name is Maya.

7
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:29,371
IMMA YOUJO

8
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,720
Welcome back, Master.

9
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:36,387
Oh?

10
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,629
Tomoka, why don't you help
her change into her uniform.

11
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:43,357
Y- Yes.

12
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,334
Wow!

13
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,438
Is this the bathroom?

14
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,144
I'll leave your change of clothes here.

15
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,380
This is gorgeous.

16
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,975
I've never seen a beautiful bathroom like this.

17
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,587
Hey, hurry up and go inside.

18
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,756
I have other work to do.

19
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,690
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

20
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,855
Please don't make a mess.

21
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,596
I get excited too easily.

22
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,462
It's a bad habit of mine... Oh well.

23
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,815
This feels great.

24
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:47,024
I can't believe I can work in such
a big mansion. It's like a dream...

25
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,986
But...

26
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,189
I'm not sure I can do well here.

27
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,003
Hey! How long are you going
to take a bath in there?

28
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,364
Y- Yes!

29
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,138
I'll be out right away!

30
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,435
Come in.

31
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:09,875
I'm Maya.

32
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,481
I'll do my best in your service.

33
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:12,879
It's a pleasure to work for you.

34
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,585
Thank you for coming in such heavy rain.

35
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,323
If you have any questions, please ask Tomoka.

36
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,522
Yes, thank you.

37
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:36,397
Our master's business is importing
and selling art and furniture.

38
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,012
This is the living room.

39
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:45,241
There are many valuable pieces
of furniture and art here.

40
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,414
Please use extra care when you clean this room.

41
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,512
Right! Oh...

42
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,221
This is the atelier for our master's son, Masao.

43
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,859
Really, so he's an artist?

44
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,401
Masao prefers to eat his meals in the atelier,

45
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,164
so always be sure to bring them here.

46
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,759
Right!

47
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,364
This is a portrait of the master's late wife.

48
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,538
Masao was the one who painted it.

49
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:11,938
Um...

50
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,042
How did she die?

51
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,044
Dunno...

52
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,480
This is the wine cellar.

53
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,487
The master enjoys having wine at dinnertime,

54
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,058
so be sure to bring him some.

55
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:25,717
Okay!

56
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,583
Huh?

57
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,086
Don't!

58
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:28,852
What?

59
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,230
You can't go in here unless our
master gives you permission.

60
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,192
Do you understand?

61
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,123
I... I'm sorry.

62
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,759
Well, come with me.

63
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,735
Y... Yes!

64
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,540
This is our room.

65
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,776
I put your things over there.

66
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,311
Oh, thank you very much.

67
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,200
Umm... Master Masao?

68
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,665
Leave it over there.

69
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,733
Ah... o-okay!

70
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,754
Maya, I brought warm milk for you.

71
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,823
You can sleep well after you drink this.

72
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,255
Thank you.

73
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,664
It's really warm.

74
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,860
And it tastes good!

75
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:45,695
I'm glad you like it.

76
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,502
I drink this every night.

77
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,003
Let's drink together from now on.

78
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,176
Can we? Wonderful!

79
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,514
It's a nice day, Tomoka.

80
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,412
It's hard to believe there
was so much rain yesterday.

81
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,454
Be quiet...

82
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,047
Please let me sleep a little more.

83
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,248
Oh!

84
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,763
Good morning, Master Masao.

85
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,401
I'm Maya.

86
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,936
Um... I brought your dinner
last night to your atelier.

87
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,141
Oh, that's a beautiful flower.

88
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,038
What is the name of this flower?

89
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,617
I like flowers very much!

90
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,716
Although, I don't know the
flowers' names very well.

91
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,688
Butjust looking at them makes me very happy.

92
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,258
Ah... Master Masao?

93
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,068
Have a good day.
Have a good day.

94
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,947
I brought your meal.

95
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,947
Um... Master Masao?

96
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,555
So, this is an artist's room?

97
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,283
I wonder what's inside this box?

98
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,523
Don't touch!

99
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,831
D- Don't touch it!

100
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,236
M- Master Masao!

101
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,309
I... I said don't touch this!

102
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,505
I- I'm sorry!

103
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:33,264
I'm planning to hold my next party
on the 15th of next month.

104
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,958
Really? I think that's a good time.

105
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,773
Anyway, how is your collection coming?

106
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,104
It's coming well.

107
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:46,835
I can't wait to show it in front of people.

108
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,510
You sound very confident.

109
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,116
Well, I look forward to seeing it.

110
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,751
Master Masao, I brought your lunch.

111
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,984
Master Masao.

112
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,204
Maya.

113
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,880
Welcome home.
Welcome home.

114
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,051
Tomoka?

115
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,798
I don't know why, but I feel dizzy.

116
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,815
Rejoice Tomoka... It's time for your debut.

117
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:46,987
The party is the 15th of this month.
I'm sure you will do well, Tomoka.

118
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,593
No way... What is this?

119
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,498
Tomoka... Mr. Hagiwara... and Master...

120
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,804
Soon I think Maya will be
ready to prepare as well.

121
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,604
I understand. Then I will
take care of it tomorrow.

122
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,340
Do a good job, Tomoka.

123
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,118
Maya, Maya!

124
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,424
Tomoka.

125
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,694
What is wrong with you?

126
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,436
You seemed like you were having a nightmare.

127
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,332
Tomoka... umm...

128
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,502
What?

129
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,700
No, it's nothing.

130
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:39,903
You're acting strangely.

131
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,845
I guess you must have had a scary dream.
Are you alright?

132
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,748
Dream? Was that a dream?

133
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,697
Have a nice day.
Have a nice day.

134
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:08,667
Huh?

135
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,307
Master Masao, I brought your meal.

136
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,078
May I come in?

137
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,947
I will leave your meal here.

138
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,139
W- Well, if you'll excuse me.

139
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,347
Hurry... and escape from here. Maya.

140
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,610
You did a really bad thing, Maya.

141
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,074
I'm very sorry!

142
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:28,079
Of all the art, how could you break
the vase that Master liked the most.

143
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,381
It's a foreign-made vase.
You can't get it in Japan.

144
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,425
You could never pay it back,

145
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,428
no matter how long you worked here.

146
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,990
M- Master!

147
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,165
I'm really sorry!

148
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:46,401
Even though you apologize,
the vase can't be fixed.

149
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,074
I'm sorry, I will do anything I can.

150
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,601
Please forgive me!

151
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,678
Maya, lift up your face.

152
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,673
Yes...

153
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:05,588
Will you do anything I say, Maya?

154
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,391
Y... Yes...

155
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,092
...Master.

156
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:21,935
<i>Nd way...</i>

157
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,273
No! Let me go! No!

158
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,413
No, help me! Please!

159
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:40,821
Tomoka.

160
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:41,616
Yes.

161
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:53,634
Maya, I will tell you what our real job is.

162
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:59,305
The maids of this mansion will become
part of our master's collection.

163
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,271
Maya, I will make you just like Tomoka.

164
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,480
I will add you as part of my collection.

165
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,755
First, I will show you the beauty
of my master's collection.

166
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,266
Watch carefully.

167
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,535
You will be just like that, soon.

168
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,138
Don't be afraid.

169
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,807
Maya, this will be your pleasure, too.

170
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,228
Tomoka, why don't you do Maya next.

171
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:27,989
Yes.

172
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,899
Now I see...

173
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,409
So, you are a virgin.

174
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,479
Let's give this to our master now.

175
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,613
No! Stop!

176
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,845
No! No! Please don't!

177
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,719
Here it comes, Maya!

178
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,091
No!

179
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,819
Maya...

180
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,583
Master Masao, I brought your meal.

181
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,850
I will leave it here.

182
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,771
Maya!

183
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,179
She's not here!

184
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,146
Maya.

185
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,800
How is it, Maya?

186
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:19,359
I will make you into a
woman like Tomoka, soon.

187
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,068
<i>Maya!</i>

188
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:29,945
Damn it!

189
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:43,225
You look beautiful, Tomoka.
Now it's time for you to debut.

190
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,360
Thank you very much, Master.

191
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,342
Maya.

192
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,448
Maya!

193
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,396
We can see Mr. Ayanokoji's
collection at the show tonight.

194
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,565
I can't wait to see it.

195
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,003
How did your collection come out?

196
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:34,201
It came out great.
I'm sure you will be very satisfied.

197
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,674
Well, it seems you have a lot of confidence.

198
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,513
How do you like it?

199
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:47,252
It's not bad, however...

200
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:47,946
However?

201
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,687
I got this from an importer the other day.

202
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,964
I wanted to add a little
spice to your collection,

203
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,431
so I brought them here.

204
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,672
Master Masao... I... I...

205
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:20,680
Maya.

206
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,714
S... Stop that, Maya!

207
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,201
The importer asked me to finance his company.

208
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:47,978
I'm thinking about it.

209
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,538
But I can't finance any more companies.

210
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,382
So I've decided to make a deal...

211
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:57,081
...with the company who has a better collection.

212
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:24,137
<i>It's no good.
I can't take it anymore.</i>

213
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:25,643
<i>Master...</i>

214
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,444
<i>Master...</i>

215
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,698
I thought your collection
could do a little better than this.

216
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,320
Master Masao, I... I!

217
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:18,896
You humiliated me, woman!

218
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,263
You disgraced my name!

219
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,366
Let's go, Hagiwara!

220
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,680
Hagiwara, I will hold a party a week from now.

221
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:41,515
What?

222
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,723
I will debut Maya.

223
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,231
This is great.

224
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,098
It's very warm.

225
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,727
I'm... I'm...

226
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,009
I'll never let anybody take you, Maya...

227
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,495
Masao! What are you doing?!

228
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,561
Masao!

229
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:21,794
Maya!

230
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,997
Hagiwara, lock up Maya in the room.

231
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:26,968
In one week,

232
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,639
I will make Maya the best of my collection...

233
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,241
...and prove to him what I can do!

234
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,344
Maya!

235
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:37,344
Shut up!

236
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:38,947
No!

237
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,615
Masao, stay in your room.

238
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,014
Paint your pictures as usual, understand?

239
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:15,149
Your wife has a nice one...

240
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:21,420
All right, I think I can take care
of your company's financing deal.

241
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,492
Thank you very much.

242
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,501
Please don't cry, Mother.

243
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,264
I will protect you.

244
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:39,068
Mother!

245
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:55,590
Mother.

246
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,228
Mother.

247
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:58,694
Mother.

248
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,490
Mother.

249
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,333
Maya.

250
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,598
Maya.

251
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,396
Maya.

252
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:08,229
Maya.

253
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:09,264
Maya.

254
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:10,503
Maya!

255
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:11,668
Maya!

256
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:12,534
Maya!

257
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,402
Maya!

258
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,270
Maya!

259
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,207
Maya!

260
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:15,971
Maya!

261
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,646
Please... Master.

262
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,816
Please let me in.

263
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:31,652
I feel crazy out here.
I will... Please!

264
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,331
Are you ready, Maya?

265
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,402
Now... Wake up, Maya.

266
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:54,436
I put everything I know into you. Wake up!

267
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,443
You are now reborn as a new woman, Maya.

268
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,750
Maya... Maya!

269
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,888
Welcome to my party, Count Mayuzumi.

270
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,496
I brought my collection as you requested.

271
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,200
Are you sure you want them to join?

272
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,500
You may regret it.

273
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,908
Please, don't worry about it.

274
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,193
You look beautiful, Maya.

275
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:46,758
I never expected you would
become such a beautiful woman.

276
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:51,598
Master has put all his hopes on this party.

277
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:56,105
Your debut is at such an important party...

278
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,335
You must be happy, Maya.

279
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,541
How prized a collectible have you become?

280
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,180
I will taste you.

281
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:56,289
Mother, they came here again.

282
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,096
What can I do?

283
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,732
They'll take Maya away from me now.

284
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,168
But, I won't let them do that.

285
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,942
Watch me, Mother.

286
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:48,276
So, this is your new collection.

287
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,019
I'm on my way, Maya.

288
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,116
Well...

289
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,421
How do you like it?

290
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,155
It's getting very exciting.

291
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,979
You might regret this, Ayanokoji.

292
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:19,834
Let's see how long your collection will last.

293
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:17,558
How do you like my Maya?

294
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:22,424
If you like, I don't mind letting you have her.

295
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,700
Really, Ayanokoji?

296
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,499
Let's not play these silly games anymore.

297
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,301
I found something more important than this.

298
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,678
I want Maya. I need nothing else.

299
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,942
I don't want money or status.
I only need Maya.

300
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:56,097
Maya is mine!
Nobody can have her!

301
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:06,600
What?

302
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:08,676
Master Masao?

303
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:12,212
Maya... I won't let anybody have Maya.

304
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,214
I'm the one who should be standing there.

305
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,846
Maya, if only you didn't come to this place...

306
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,290
Don't, Tomoka!

307
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,820
Maya!

308
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,643
I will protect Maya.

309
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,307
What are you doing here, Masao?!

310
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,953
Nobody can stop me.

311
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,754
Nobody can take Maya away.
Maya is mine!

312
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,380
Maya is mine.

313
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,117
Maya is mine!

314
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,000
This is a wonderful collection.

315
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:31,205
Would you please let me have him?

316
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,208
Of course, I will pay you a desirable sum.

317
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,247
Well, all right...

318
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,513
...but only because the request
is from Count Tachibana's wife.
