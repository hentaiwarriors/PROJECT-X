1
00:00:00,457 --> 00:00:01,583
Oh my god!

2
00:00:01,658 --> 00:00:02,852
Now what do l do?

3
00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:05,724
My princess has been
possessed by three demons!

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,795
Now she scares me more than usual.

5
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:13,230
l'm afraid that Rike alone
will not be strong enough...

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,166
Then there's Karisu, but what is she really?

7
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:19,071
Next episode, we will
find out in the climax!

8
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:20,805
Look forward to it.

9
00:00:21,144 --> 00:00:22,042
What?

10
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:24,205
Someone's going to try and rape me?

11
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:25,946
Oh no!

12
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:33,079
At a time when swords
and sorcery ruled all things...

13
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:37,090
Rike Arrow, a candidate
for the Dragon Knights...

14
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:40,055
...met Karisu, who was
the decedent of a dragon.

15
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:42,892
Her mother was killed
by the Dragon Devil Clan...

16
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:45,797
...and she vowed to
fight as Rike's dragon.

17
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:49,995
They traveled to Dragon Kingdom,
the stronghold of the Dragon Knights.

18
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:56,904
However, they are opposed by
three devils, revived by the evil Oruga...

19
00:00:57,247 --> 00:01:01,843
...and Rike's fiancee, Princess Lydia,
who was possessed by the demons.

20
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:07,123
Now, another battle will rage...

21
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:25,898
Oruga is so obnoxious.

22
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:30,876
Karisu, if you wake up, the
three demons wouldn't be so scary.

23
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:34,947
We should just trust our destiny, now.

24
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:48,654
Ramie.

25
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:49,523
Yes!

26
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:51,859
Oh, no.

27
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:54,096
You realized it was me?

28
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:57,535
You know where l was, don't you?

29
00:01:57,975 --> 00:02:00,205
You saw Rike and Karisu, didn't you?

30
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:04,738
Tell me more about
this Rike and Karisu.

31
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:06,241
P-Princess...

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,715
Avisu, what are you...

33
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:14,782
Who are you?

34
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:17,584
l'm lrya.

35
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:19,125
Dragon Devil Clan?

36
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,425
How did you know, kitty cat?

37
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,296
No, no, no.

38
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:26,393
Help me princess, l'll be eaten!

39
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:28,467
l don't wanna die, l don't wanna die.

40
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:31,166
Be quiet, l won't eat you.

41
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:32,003
You're lying.

42
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:35,374
l'll be killed and become bones!

43
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:37,539
Princess, princess!

44
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:47,915
You're such a cute kitty.

45
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:52,986
May l help you, Rike?

46
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:53,586
lt's okay.

47
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,359
l'm sorry, Karisu.

48
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:58,323
My dad was too excited.

49
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,999
No problem.

50
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:04,338
He was happy because he
hasn't seen you in a while.

51
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:07,107
And, about what my dad said...

52
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:07,833
What?

53
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,012
Well, he wants you to be my wife.

54
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:15,918
l know, you have Lydia.

55
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:19,955
And, if he saw my real form...

56
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:21,948
Don't think like that!

57
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:24,920
Rike!

58
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:28,331
No!

59
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:29,160
What's this?

60
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,699
Karisu, don't struggle!

61
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:33,329
No, no, l can't believe it.

62
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:35,132
Karisu, calm down, Karisu.

63
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:43,012
Rike, leave me alone.

64
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,040
B-But, l have to make the bed.

65
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:49,279
l'm sorry.

66
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:50,148
Good night.

67
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:56,289
Rike...

68
00:03:57,928 --> 00:04:00,226
l know it was my fault, but...

69
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:04,197
Karisu was suddenly
ashamed, what's with her?

70
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:08,529
l don't know why but,
l'm thinking about Karisu.

71
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,600
l have Lydia, though...

72
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:13,342
Rike, are you still awake?

73
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,638
Y-Yes.

74
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:18,046
Don't worry about earlier.

75
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:19,275
O-Okay.

76
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:21,613
l was thinking about tomorrow's game.

77
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:23,883
l hope you can win.

78
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:25,349
Yes, thank you.

79
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:28,489
Then, you can see Lydia everyday.

80
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,182
Well...

81
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:30,791
No... Y-Yes...

82
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:32,123
Why are you stuttering?

83
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,890
N-Not really.

84
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:36,455
Look, what do you think l am?

85
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:39,428
l look human as well as Dragon.

86
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,160
Karisu...

87
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:41,836
Well, it's okay.

88
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:46,368
lf you become a Dragon
Knight, l'll leave here, anyway.

89
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,772
N-No.

90
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:50,306
Please stay here, Karisu.

91
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:55,607
Karisu, if you leave, l'm...

92
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:57,547
R-Rike...

93
00:04:58,054 --> 00:04:59,885
K-Karisu, l...

94
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:09,931
Karisu...

95
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:17,999
Finally, you'll have a
game with Rike tomorrow.

96
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:21,237
Yes, l will certainly win tomorrow.

97
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:25,503
And, l'll show him the real
power of a Dragon Knight.

98
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:28,006
l'm sure you can do it.

99
00:05:30,353 --> 00:05:31,877
Go for it, tomorrow.

100
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:32,613
Y-Yes.

101
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:36,285
M-Miss Lydia...

102
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,394
The King and the Dragon Knights
will pray for the Dragon Devil Clan.

103
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:44,096
We will have your body, too.

104
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:45,293
Y-You guys are?

105
00:05:51,975 --> 00:05:56,969
Warrior Karisu, who was once
called the best of the Dragon God Clan...

106
00:05:57,547 --> 00:06:01,278
l can't believe that she lost to someone
like Oruga of the Dragon Devil Clan.

107
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:05,220
Orufe, it's good.

108
00:06:06,723 --> 00:06:10,318
Orufe, l love you, Orufe.

109
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:16,429
l don't care about the
Dragon God Clan any more.

110
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,192
lf you are with me...

111
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:26,436
l want to go somewhere
nobody knows about, with you...

112
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:36,314
Why can't we love each other?

113
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:44,559
Come on, Orufe!

114
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:46,026
Come on!

115
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:47,953
l want to have your baby!

116
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:50,456
Orufe...

117
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:53,497
Orufe...

118
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:58,103
Karisu loved a young man
from the Dragon Devil Clan.

119
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:02,436
l didn't expect her to intercept Oruga
when he showed up among the humans.

120
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:07,413
However, she was sealed and
reborn as a human in modern times.

121
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:26,163
Hey...

122
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:28,698
What?

123
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:32,136
l'm sorry, last night, l slapped you.

124
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:34,309
lt's my fault.

125
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:35,571
l was stupid.

126
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:39,146
Besides, it was just
payment for a good feel.

127
00:07:39,215 --> 00:07:40,876
S-Stupid lecher!

128
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:42,617
Rike...

129
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,182
Karisu, we have to win!

130
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:47,419
Yes.

131
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:51,254
For Rike's grand dream.

132
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:01,702
Lydia!

133
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,568
Hey, Lydia, it's me.

134
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:08,701
Lydia, l promise, we will win today.

135
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:12,406
What happened?

136
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:13,979
Excuse me, Karisu.

137
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:14,812
Wait a minute.

138
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:16,351
O-Okay.

139
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,077
Hey, Lydia, wait for me!

140
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:20,212
Lydia, Lydia!

141
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:28,120
Karisu, Karisu, Karisu, my Karisu.

142
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,294
l'm your mother from now on.

143
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:37,904
Don't fool with me.

144
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:43,339
Oh no, you're a problem child.

145
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:48,846
You have to learn cooking
soon and become a good wife.

146
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,419
You grew so much.

147
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:55,352
You'll be taller than me soon.

148
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:58,926
Karisu, my precious Karisu.

149
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,131
l want to go back my mom's village...

150
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:09,370
But, l decided to do
my best as Rike's Dragon.

151
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:24,644
Karisu, l'm sorry about...

152
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:25,278
lt's okay!

153
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:27,385
We should
concentrate on the game, now.

154
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:31,684
We will begin the race
between Rike and Voon!

155
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:35,686
Get the flag on the peak of
Erukesu Mountain, 30 km from here...

156
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:38,131
...and the one who
comes back first is the winner.

157
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:40,200
Are you guys ready?

158
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,027
Yes!

159
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:44,305
Ready, go!

160
00:09:57,587 --> 00:10:00,852
Does Voon think l have a handicap?

161
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,183
Voon, he's giving up the lead...

162
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,158
ldiot, don't dig your own grave.

163
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:08,024
A final bit of entertainment...

164
00:10:08,097 --> 00:10:09,928
Have a fun, Kaizerd.

165
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,173
Karisu, we should
finish this game in one rush!

166
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:19,534
Okay, hold on!

167
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:28,280
Did Voon give up?

168
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:32,154
Rike!

169
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:35,081
Voon!

170
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,851
Rike, are you all right?

171
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:40,791
What is Voon doing?

172
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:42,626
Where did he go?

173
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:46,499
Karisu, left!

174
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:55,537
lllusion!

175
00:10:55,912 --> 00:10:57,004
Where's the real one?

176
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:00,176
What is that?

177
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:01,381
Good timing.

178
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:03,419
She is the garnish on
today's entertainment.

179
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,014
Twin Darkness Ring!

180
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:14,191
You are...

181
00:11:14,564 --> 00:11:18,330
l'm Musa of the Dragon
God Clan, Karisu's side.

182
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:19,827
Where is Karisu?

183
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:23,995
Hey!

184
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:25,673
She is all right.

185
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:28,072
And, you will know
about her past soon.

186
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:30,574
Karisu's past?

187
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:32,875
These wings...

188
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:34,142
Dragon Devil Clan?

189
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:36,585
Voon, what is this?

190
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:40,482
She is a demon, pretending to
be Rike's dragon to deceive us.

191
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:42,852
We should finish her off.

192
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:44,819
Who is this girl?

193
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:47,692
This is the girl who killed
our fellows in Tarutarp village.

194
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:50,392
Then we should kill her, immediately.

195
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:51,629
Wait, Voon.

196
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:54,436
Go to hell, monster!

197
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:56,437
<i>White Dragon Light Ray!</i>

198
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,264
White Dragon Light Ray?

199
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:04,811
Rike and you are Musa's...

200
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:07,811
Shit, Musa already detected us.

201
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:08,775
Karisu!

202
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,619
Karisu, wake up, Karisu.

203
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:17,553
l see, you followed Oruga to get here.

204
00:12:17,627 --> 00:12:19,618
That voice is, as l expected...

205
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:27,965
Lydia?

206
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:31,905
Karisu!

207
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:33,900
Lydia, what are you doing?

208
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:37,302
Karisu, Karisu, wake up!

209
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:38,536
Karisu!

210
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:44,282
lrya, Golgo, appear!

211
00:12:44,354 --> 00:12:46,185
Now we'll get revenge!

212
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:49,951
Long time no see, King Kaizerd.

213
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:52,357
However, l guess you
don't recognize me in this shape.

214
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:54,496
<i>Demon Dragon Transformation!</i>

215
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:57,892
Shit!

216
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:00,260
That...

217
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,778
The three headed dragon...

218
00:13:11,314 --> 00:13:14,249
Oh, no, did Lydia make them appear?

219
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:16,275
Everybody, get together!

220
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,648
Come on, Kaizerd.

221
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,656
l'll fight you myself!

222
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:23,788
Karisu, wake up.

223
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,790
Don't die!

224
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:32,295
Dragon Devil Clan, l'll obliterate you!

225
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:35,130
After we beat you...

226
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:37,798
...we will exterminate
all humans in this world!

227
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:47,909
Originally, this wouldn't kill a
member of the Dragon God Clan...

228
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:50,744
...but her power is sealed now...

229
00:13:51,254 --> 00:13:53,984
Tell me, what happened in her past.

230
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:59,718
Majesty, are these not Dragon Devils?

231
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:06,065
Kaizerd, you should watch as your
proud Dragon Knights are destroyed!

232
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,395
<i>Deadly Darkness Extinction Blast!</i>

233
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:13,065
Kain, Roisu, Randy!

234
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:14,200
Shit, son of a...

235
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,839
Really, Karisu did all that...

236
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:19,838
Rike, put your hand on her chest.

237
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:28,852
To break her seal, she doesn't need
only my power, but also someone's love.

238
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:32,154
Rike, do you love this girl?

239
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:36,625
lf she has your love, her seal
will be broken and she will revive.

240
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,198
Wish strongly with
my image in your heart.

241
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:43,932
lf you do, your thoughts will
definitely reach me someday soon.

242
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:50,175
The three headed dragon
is whirling about in the sky.

243
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,606
Like the battle back then...

244
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:56,109
My love, Orufe...

245
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:03,324
You deceived me and
killed many from my clan.

246
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,623
l believed you, though...

247
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:12,893
Orufe, Orufe, did you really love me?

248
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:15,594
But, you are already mine.

249
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:17,695
l won't give you to anybody...

250
00:15:18,174 --> 00:15:19,402
All mine...

251
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:21,966
Karisu, wake up, Karisu.

252
00:15:22,178 --> 00:15:24,772
Who is calling my name?

253
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:33,380
l see, this young person
is the other man l loved.

254
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:35,083
But l wasn't really myself...

255
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:36,147
No, Karisu.

256
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:39,819
Although you were reborn in the
human world, your love for him was real.

257
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:40,959
Karisu!

258
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:43,456
Respond to Rike's heart!

259
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:06,185
Karisu.

260
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:07,185
Are you Karisu?

261
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:11,453
Finally, you woke up.

262
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:13,059
Musa?

263
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:15,623
Karisu...

264
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,832
Orufe...

265
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:20,068
l'm glad!

266
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:24,902
Rike...

267
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:26,466
Majesty, it's hopeless.

268
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:28,703
They are too strong for us.

269
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:29,675
Shit!

270
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:37,586
Oh no, my Dragon's Eye!

271
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:41,087
We must beat them,
even at the cost of our lives!

272
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:43,082
Please, pull back your soldiers!

273
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:47,287
Musa?

274
00:16:47,363 --> 00:16:48,330
No, it's not!

275
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:51,493
That's the girl, Karisu!

276
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,131
Rike's Fighting Dragon!

277
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:56,502
Back off, Kid!

278
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,168
l will get Lydia back.

279
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,303
Cheeky brat.

280
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:05,470
We'll show you our true power.

281
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:08,841
What?

282
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:15,655
Yes!

283
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,630
Good job, but if you
use your breath any more...

284
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:27,633
This girl, who is
fused with us, will die too!

285
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,137
Lydia!

286
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:32,040
Rike, Dad...

287
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:37,337
Rike, l'm sorry.

288
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:40,514
Many people died because of me.

289
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,977
lf l didn't do such a stupid thing...

290
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:44,812
Don't worry about me.

291
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:47,321
Please, destroy them!

292
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,318
lt's unavoidable, Rike.

293
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:51,750
No, Majesty, we shouldn't...

294
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:54,630
l drove Lydia to this...

295
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,123
That's true.

296
00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:01,701
Just stay quiet until we
complete our regeneration.

297
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:06,831
That is a horrible power, which
steals souls and converts it into energy.

298
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,237
lf Lydia doesn't try to
save herself, she'll never escape.

299
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:14,849
Rike, only you can make her try.

300
00:18:15,117 --> 00:18:16,982
l understand, l'll try.

301
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:18,510
Help me, Karisu.

302
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:19,652
Sure.

303
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:21,616
What are you doing?

304
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,281
Will you leave our princess stranded?

305
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:26,984
lt can't be!

306
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,594
Where did you hide?

307
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:37,837
What are you trying to do?

308
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,370
Rike, it's okay.

309
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,641
Everyone has a grudge
against me, and even you hate me.

310
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:48,511
l have no place to go back to.

311
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:49,709
Don't be stupid!

312
00:18:50,152 --> 00:18:53,212
Lydia, no one has a grudge you.

313
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:55,654
You were just deceived.

314
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:57,722
Everybody is waiting for you.

315
00:18:58,294 --> 00:19:00,854
Don't die, let's go back, Lydia.

316
00:19:01,597 --> 00:19:03,121
Don't make everyone sad.

317
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,998
But...

318
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,557
You have Karisu...

319
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:11,267
l'm sorry about Karisu,
but Lydia, l want you...

320
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:13,401
l want you to live!

321
00:19:13,843 --> 00:19:16,004
Rike, l...

322
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:17,670
l actually don't want to die...

323
00:19:17,913 --> 00:19:20,381
l want to live more and more!

324
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:25,385
Rike!

325
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:27,049
Karisu!

326
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:42,200
Lydia, Rike!

327
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:53,672
Karisu, Rike!

328
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:04,856
ls Lydia okay?

329
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:07,223
Don't worry, Majesty.

330
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:08,860
Karisu!

331
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:13,827
Was l dreaming?

332
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,871
No, it was an obvious fact...

333
00:20:18,974 --> 00:20:21,135
There is a man who needs me.

334
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,701
l also need him.

335
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:27,180
To respond to that, one more time...

336
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:28,941
...one more time...

337
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:32,377
Rike...

338
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:33,351
Karisu...

339
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:35,647
l was...

340
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:38,225
You passed out after
beating the three headed dragon.

341
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:40,619
Karisu, l'm sorry.

342
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:41,594
l've been...

343
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:45,466
Don't say anything,
l know what happened...

344
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:53,374
l've heard everything from
Musa, but l love you as you are now.

345
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:13,687
You fool...

346
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:21,497
No, if you do it...

347
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:29,273
lt's too...

348
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:30,669
Too good...

349
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,747
Please...

350
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:34,716
Don't...

351
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:53,868
K-Karisu...

352
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:58,599
This is for earlier,
l won't forgive you easily.

353
00:22:00,075 --> 00:22:02,168
l'll stroke you slowly.

354
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,039
l'm already...

355
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:11,608
Hold back!

356
00:22:12,054 --> 00:22:14,215
Don't come by yourself, it's not fair.

357
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,289
You naughty girl, l'll punish you all night.

358
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:20,623
No!

359
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:24,261
Please, be nice to me...

360
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,992
B-Beautiful...

361
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:44,813
That tickles!

362
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,457
No...

363
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:56,086
Rike...

364
00:22:56,865 --> 00:23:01,802
Rike, please don't be mean to me.

365
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:03,965
What do you want me to do?

366
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,733
My body feels so strange.

367
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:09,409
Please...

368
00:23:09,812 --> 00:23:11,473
Lick me, lick me there!

369
00:23:11,547 --> 00:23:13,242
Karisu, you are so cute.

370
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,655
Good, good...

371
00:23:24,093 --> 00:23:25,993
Rike, lick more...

372
00:23:37,406 --> 00:23:38,839
Karisu, touch it.

373
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:41,568
See?

374
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:44,209
l drank from your
vessel, and l got so hard!

375
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:48,107
l know, dummy!

376
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:50,148
Please, enter me!

377
00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:58,218
l feel it!

378
00:23:58,294 --> 00:24:00,319
lt's so hot and thick inside me!

379
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,933
Good, good!

380
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:12,130
Rike, push it in deeper!

381
00:24:14,276 --> 00:24:15,072
Great!

382
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:16,974
l can feel it all the way inside me.

383
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:20,477
Move around more!

384
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,052
Move...

385
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,316
So good!

386
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:38,997
Karisu, l'm coming.

387
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:41,593
Wait, Rike!

388
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:44,867
l want to come with you!

389
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,005
Karisu, you're getting tighter!

390
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:51,372
l know, you're getting bigger inside me!

391
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:58,378
Rike!

392
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:03,686
l feel so good.

393
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:08,329
l feel you filling me up more and more!

394
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:26,875
l see, he's gone.

395
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:29,174
Yes, with Karisu.

396
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:33,184
He promised that he would become
a true Dragon Knight, and come back.

397
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:35,281
Sounds like him.

398
00:25:35,357 --> 00:25:37,416
He is the man who l trust.

399
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:39,427
Don't forget, he is my son.

400
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:42,319
Rike has left...

401
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:43,691
With Karisu...

402
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,461
Please come back
safely, then l will be your lover.

403
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:50,628
Don't you envy young people?

404
00:25:50,873 --> 00:25:51,464
Yes.

405
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,477
Rike, have experiences as broad
as this sky, and then come back.

406
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:01,512
Rike, where are we going?

407
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,982
First, we will visit your mother's grave.

408
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,112
After that?

409
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:08,717
After that...

410
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:11,755
Let's explore the wide, free world!

411
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:15,895
Rike, l'm with you.

412
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:18,024
Feeling good, Karisu?

413
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:18,267
