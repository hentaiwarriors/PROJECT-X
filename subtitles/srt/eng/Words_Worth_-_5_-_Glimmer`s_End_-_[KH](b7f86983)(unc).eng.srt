1
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:14,718
<i>l never imagined there'd be one
so skilled among the Swordsmen of Light.</i>

2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,295
But this is it!

3
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,666
<i>That sword....</i>

4
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:29,400
Sharon!

5
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:50,187
Sharon!

6
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:26,990
Die, Wartoshika!

7
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:29,763
Damn monster!

8
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,835
Come on, Black Fog!

9
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:43,709
Dark Wind!

10
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:13,540
Mother?
Darkness has returned.

11
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:20,753
Sir Pollux. Mother!

12
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:25,254
<i>l'm going.
Go then, Mew.</i>

13
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,059
Your ring shall protect you.

14
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,160
Mother.

15
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:54,184
<i>The sand must have absorbed the impact.</i>

16
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:02,358
<i>This girl....</i>

17
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:08,398
<i>l can almost remember....</i>

18
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:15,805
Could that be?

19
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:38,055
<i>Where does he think he's going?</i>

20
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,085
What is this?

21
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,606
<i>What's this? This view. I've seen it before.</i>

22
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,996
<i>l'm....</i>

23
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,539
<i>Damn, what're you doing here?</i>

24
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,899
This room belongs to Astral!

25
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,171
Astral?

26
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:06,944
Damn you!

27
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:12,219
Sharon?

28
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,569
<i>Sharon, it's me.</i>

29
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,671
<i>l'm Astral.</i>

30
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:36,878
Astral?

31
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:41,781
<i>Liar. You're lying.</i>

32
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:47,054
<i>l'm not lying. lt's me.</i>

33
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:56,458
You really are Astral.

34
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:11,948
<i>Tell me l'm not dreaming.
Tell me you are Astral.</i>

35
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:13,144
Yes.

36
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:21,827
Damn bastards of Shadows!

37
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:26,262
ls there any other way in?
Find one! Find a way to their territory!

38
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,235
Must be this way. l sense evil.

39
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,410
Oh, Astral.

40
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,952
You are alive. Oh, Astral.

41
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:54,822
<i>l'm so glad l've lived.</i>

42
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:07,671
l lost my memory and l was
wandering through the Land of Light.

43
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,109
This is like a dream, Astral.

44
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,482
<i>How l wished to see you again.
l've been praying every day.</i>

45
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:24,583
<i>Sharon. l've so wanted to see you.</i>

46
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:45,436
Please. Come.

47
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,274
Sharon.

48
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,311
<i>l'm sorry.</i>

49
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:57,286
<i>lt's okay, don't worry about me.
Come to me.</i>

50
00:07:58,224 --> 00:07:59,486
Sharon.

51
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:09,326
Astral.

52
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:13,168
<i>lncredible. l've been waiting
for this for 20 years.</i>

53
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,405
Tell me this is not a dream.

54
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:32,250
When have you become
this powerful and strong?

55
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,155
Sharon, l love you.

56
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:40,693
Oh, Astral.

57
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:30,341
<i>l'm going crazy. More, more, stroke me.</i>

58
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,478
Oh, Astral.

59
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,063
So good. When did you become this wild?

60
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,395
Sharon.

61
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:54,899
So good, Astral, more, more.

62
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:03,378
<i>Astral, l'm coming.</i>

63
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,223
<i>l'm coming.</i>

64
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:16,891
Astral, please come with me.

65
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:17,952
Yeah.

66
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:44,552
How pathetic you are, Wartoshika!
Enough playing around.

67
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:46,657
Get ready to die.

68
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,353
<i>We'll kill you both...</i>

69
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:52,227
...and shatter the Words Worth Tablet
to smithereens again.

70
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:55,267
<i>lt'll never be rebuilt again!</i>

71
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,962
Who the hell are you two?

72
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,171
<i>We're the Rulers of Darkness!</i>

73
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:10,315
Sir Wartoshika!

74
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,147
Look at the lovebirds!

75
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:17,916
We shall taste that girl as well!

76
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:34,034
Damn you.

77
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:41,772
<i>That must be the Underground Castle.</i>

78
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:53,814
<i>An Agent of Darkness?</i>

79
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,592
When you were lost
in that battle 20 years ago...

80
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:03,066
...l realized for the first time
l was in love with you.

81
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:08,032
<i>l've searched for your mirage.</i>

82
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:11,769
l came to this room every day.

83
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:14,340
Sharon.

84
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:23,182
<i>Let's go meet everyone.
Astral!</i>

85
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,392
Who is it?

86
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:35,990
Delta.

87
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,965
<i>l'm not taking a roundabout approach
this time.</i>

88
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:43,568
Astral!

89
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,078
<i>l've got you!</i>

90
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,247
Astral!

91
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:56,115
<i>That was Delta,
but she wasn't acting like Delta.</i>

92
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,887
Freeze, Pollux!

93
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,752
<i>l've got you!</i>

94
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:13,970
Prepare to die!

95
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:23,205
Sir Pollux!

96
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:26,383
Astral!

97
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:31,082
Evil of Darkness, leave this place!
Mystral Window!

98
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,792
Astral!
Sir Pollux!

99
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:40,264
Astral, are you all right?
Sir Pollux, come back to us!

100
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,800
Astral.
Pollux.

101
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:43,233
Astral.
Pollux.

102
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:45,293
Pollux.
Astral.

103
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:49,734
Ouch.

104
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:53,569
<i>Mew, Sharon....</i>

105
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:00,347
This is bad!

106
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,623
What are you guys doing over there?

107
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:11,491
Delta?

108
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:14,692
Ouch. What have l been doing?

109
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:17,095
<i>Oh no! lt's an emergency!</i>

110
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,367
Tessio was meeting
the Commander of the Land of Light...

111
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:23,567
...to discuss how to destroy
both the Lands of Light and Shadows.

112
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:25,110
What?

113
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:29,412
Those two are probably the source of evil...

114
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:33,043
...that destroyed the Words Worth Tablet
to bring Darkness to this world!

115
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:36,111
Delta, take us to where you saw them.

116
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,690
Sir Fabris!

117
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,783
<i>We've found what looks like an air duct.</i>

118
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:44,694
We suspect it may lead to their territory.

119
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:47,028
What? Tell that to the whole army!

120
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:49,624
<i>We'll seize their headquarters at once!</i>

121
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:55,874
Stop it!

122
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:02,370
How tight she is.

123
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:11,882
<i>Produce the One Who Mixes
Light and Shadows? Don't make us laugh.</i>

124
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:18,093
We shall scrape out your seed in here.

125
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:21,861
Stop it!

126
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,800
No!

127
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:35,075
<i>Nobody's here.</i>

128
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:40,211
Shush, l hear voices.

129
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,485
Sir Astral!

130
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,757
Nina?
Am l dreaming?

131
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:56,623
<i>You're not dreaming.
l'm getting you out of there now.</i>

132
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:58,494
Sir Astral.

133
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:01,202
Do they know each other?

134
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,376
Looks like it. Looks like more than that.

135
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:42,776
<i>Sir Astral! How l've longed to see you!</i>

136
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,914
<i>She's hugging him!</i>

137
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:49,086
<i>Now he's holding her tight!</i>

138
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,884
Mother, who is this?

139
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,018
Ariadonne, this is your father.

140
00:16:56,996 --> 00:16:58,588
Daddy?

141
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:01,198
What did she say?

142
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:02,859
His daughter?

143
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:04,402
Mystral

144
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,071
Watch out for the water!

145
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:20,347
Sir Astral!

146
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:21,880
Mother!

147
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:28,253
No. Stop!

148
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:31,558
<i>We've had Light and Shadows
fighting each other for years...</i>

149
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,258
...and everything was going as we planned.

150
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,702
But thanks to you,
we have to speed up our plans.

151
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,769
<i>Shut up!
l won't let you get away with this!</i>

152
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:47,512
What can you do now?

153
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:50,210
Damn you!

154
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,820
The Words Worth Tablet!

155
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:04,689
l knew it was you, the Tribe of Shadows!

156
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:13,962
Damn monster!

157
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:17,970
They are the ones that destroyed
the Words Worth Tablet!

158
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:20,178
The Rulers of Darkness!

159
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:21,474
What?

160
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:29,653
We have the Kings
of Light and Shadows together.

161
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:34,190
We shall kill them all once and for all!

162
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:36,386
Damn you!

163
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:37,996
Die!

164
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,640
That man!

165
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:57,806
Astral!
Pollux!

166
00:18:58,484 --> 00:18:59,883
Damn!

167
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:22,236
Mystral Window!

168
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,613
Damn you, how dare you?

169
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:35,978
<i>We'll blow everything away
and turn this into a Land of Nothing!</i>

170
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:41,389
Mew, give me your power.

171
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,022
Dark Wind!

172
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:32,033
<i>Finally it's over.</i>

173
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,271
Sir Astral!

174
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:10,705
l never imagined
l was from the Land of Light.

175
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,186
lf it is true, he should be much older.

176
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:19,417
<i>No. That ring you are wearing....</i>

177
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:23,952
<i>lt gives you the same ''Time'' as we have.</i>

178
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:29,962
l kidnapped you from
the Tribe of Light when you were a baby...

179
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:34,870
...to produce
the One Who Mixes Light and Shadows.

180
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,377
<i>I was determined to find out
the secret of Words Worth Tablet.</i>

181
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:46,750
<i>Pollux....
Astral's father, was his name Pollux?</i>

182
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,879
<i>l don't know that.</i>

183
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,555
His features, his swordsmanship...

184
00:21:55,427 --> 00:21:59,261
<i>...Pollux's mysterious
and sudden disappearance....</i>

185
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:02,257
lf so, then all of this makes sense.

186
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:07,169
Had we known about
the presence of Darkness...

187
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:11,568
...we could have
spared ourselves of meaningless wars.

188
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:17,911
Sir Wartoshika!

189
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,543
Sir Wartoshika!

190
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:30,590
<i>Meaningless wars....</i>

191
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:38,129
One more piece.

192
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,479
Can l have this?
Yeah.

193
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:17,199
Look at the Tablet inscription.

194
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:29,918
<i>What does it say?
l've never seen this language.</i>

195
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,196
<i>''l am God. Tribes of Light and Shadows.''</i>

196
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:44,067
l see! This is child is
the One Who Mixes Light and Shadows.

197
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:47,965
<i>''Listen to me.''</i>

198
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:51,036
<i>You mustn't read it!</i>

199
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:55,740
How could we lose to a mere child?

200
00:23:57,282 --> 00:24:01,116
lf only Wartoshika had not kidnapped
a baby from the Tribe of Light.

201
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:04,917
lf only he had not tried to have
him read the Words Worth Tablet.

202
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,757
We were so close to destroying all of you.

203
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,264
Our bodies are going.

204
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:20,962
Our bodies are going.

205
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:27,068
<i>''l created Light.</i>

206
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:30,238
<i>''And l created the Darkness
at the same time.</i>

207
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:34,945
<i>''But these are not your final forms.''</i>

208
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:36,782
What is that blue ceiling up there?

209
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:42,588
<i>''One day...</i>

210
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:46,159
<i>''...you two shall be complete.''</i>
