1
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:08,050
If you like what I've done...

2
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:09,617
Yes...

3
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:14,017
To my wet lips
your soft, sweet and melting...

4
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:17,996
Yes...

5
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:22,757
Now, come here... soft... Elfarcia.

6
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:27,530
Soft and sweet, melting.

7
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:33,042
A kiss from you... melting... Melting?

8
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:36,082
Hmm? Marshmallow!

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,314
Yes, my favorite, sweet and melting.

10
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:43,822
It's delicious. Would you like another one?
I'm sure you'd like it.

11
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:50,654
Oh, Mr. Angel...

12
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:53,498
Oh, he must've left.

13
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:55,729
My Mr. Angel...

14
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:59,495
I haven't left yet!

15
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:09,307
Ouch... My butt... my butt... it hurts!

16
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:13,878
If the moonlight wasn't this bright,
I could go home naked...

17
00:01:13,954 --> 00:01:19,221
but anyone who sees me will treat me
like a pervert... Hmm? That girl.

18
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:21,818
She's Spika, I'm sure.

19
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:25,722
Oh, I'm lucky! Hey! Spika!

20
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:34,469
I'm sure she's Spika... but not Spika?

21
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:44,007
Eeek! What's that?

22
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:49,148
B-Beauty...

23
00:01:57,764 --> 00:02:00,358
Geez... I got no treasure. That's not fair.

24
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:04,860
Blame your greed for your loss,
not me, you big numbnuts!

25
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,097
Interference...

26
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:19,017
- Hey! Wait! Wait!
- Hmm... What was I? Keith?

27
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:25,956
Pervert.

28
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:34,390
Romance is in the Flash of the Sword II

29
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:40,601
Episode 5 "For the sake of... Ellise!?"

30
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:50,807
I just said you took it wrong!

31
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:53,779
Say something for me, Master!

32
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:57,889
That idiot, Keith!

33
00:02:58,191 --> 00:02:59,783
Spika!

34
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,825
Hey you, give it up! I said...

35
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:06,489
Sorry... Sorry.

36
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:13,970
Alright, I understand why you're so mad.
What went wrong with Keith last night?

37
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:16,274
He was acting so weird.

38
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:18,610
How exactly would I know?!

39
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:20,646
How would you know... how would I know?!

40
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:23,376
In the middle of the road!
Even with your charm.

41
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,180
You're not the most desirable date, I'd say...

42
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:29,054
What date?! Who and who?

43
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:32,956
There was a man and a woman.
It was a romantic night.

44
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:36,518
The moon was out,
and the man was so excited.

45
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:41,533
I mean, he was a hussy, she was a hussy,
and they were hussing each other.

46
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:44,163
The romance... oh.

47
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:48,196
What a wicked hussy, I mean,
a man playing a hussy.

48
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,536
Woa! That's gotta hurt.

49
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,769
Oh boy.

50
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,146
I hate homosexuals!

51
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:08,859
Hey, did you see just now?
Another woman right next to Spika!

52
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:10,121
No...

53
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:15,059
So tell me, am I delusional?

54
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:19,196
But, I could really see that girl...
that pretty girl...

55
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,597
Not nice... really.

56
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:25,934
But I wasn't on a date with him!

57
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:29,711
Yeah, I know.
You didn't have to do that though.

58
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,941
What's this? I did it?

59
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:38,520
If it wasn't a date,
what were you two doing there?

60
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:43,288
Hmm, you know... I can't remember...

61
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:47,631
Hmmm, how mysterious!
It's a puzzle... Hmmm...

62
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:53,603
What happened to Keith, I wonder?

63
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:59,678
Hey, you! What're you doing?

64
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:25,530
Oh... What's happening to me?

65
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:47,986
Humph?

66
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:54,631
What's this? Is this...

67
00:05:55,035 --> 00:06:00,905
Did Mr. Angel leave this behind?
Gramps! Gramps!

68
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,521
Hmmm... Spika... Where's she going?

69
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:22,951
I don't know. But, look at this fog
coming down... on a bright sunny day.

70
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:35,975
Body Conditioning Center?

71
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:38,567
It's the popular massage parlor.

72
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:41,944
Spika's got a great body,
but she's been complaining about her thigh.

73
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:45,178
She says it's too thick.
I don't know what she's talking about.

74
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:48,186
Women are never satisfied.
I think it looks great.

75
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,419
You can't live with them,
you can't live without them.

76
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:55,789
Master said she left hurriedly
after work yesterday, too.

77
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:57,886
I don't know what's going on,
do you?

78
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:02,291
Actually, I do. That means
the secret is right here.

79
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:03,925
What do you mean?

80
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,201
Ouch!

81
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:11,939
What I mean is that I'm the only one
who can see that pretty girl.

82
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:18,574
That's why I have to find out exactly
who she really is, you see?

83
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:24,254
This guy, he's sure loaded
with a lot of dreams and desires.

84
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:34,262
You don't need to tell me,
I can see the effects.

85
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:38,898
Thanks to you.
But, I can't allow too much...

86
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,877
I want that beauty to massage me too...

87
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:57,988
For whom is it
that you want to be beautiful?

88
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:01,050
Oh yes, my secret.

89
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,372
Keith...

90
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:17,632
Not that spot...

91
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:24,380
This? Or, how about this?

92
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:38,957
See, you're getting wet.

93
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:42,866
You'll be feeling more... You like this?

94
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:47,270
No... l'm embarrassed.

95
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,577
- Don't stop. Yes, more!
- Do you regularly masturbate alone?

96
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:58,609
Don't... l'm embarrassed... I feel it...

97
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:02,277
A lot harder...

98
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:04,788
Hey, Keith... Something's wrong.

99
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:08,021
That's not like the Spika we know...

100
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,796
Didn't know Spika gets that excited...

101
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:15,960
That's not what I mean.
Oh, boy, this guy.

102
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:23,673
When you masturbate,
what do you think of, me?

103
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:27,836
Keith... This is better than masturbating...

104
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:34,009
No... no... no... no...

105
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:37,319
It's good...

106
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:47,789
I'm going crazy...

107
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:56,732
No... no...

108
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:05,512
I've never felt this way before...

109
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,857
What're you doing?

110
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:25,394
It's the best way to deal with
that poisonous fog... come on.

111
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:28,473
What are you talking about?
Poisonous fog?

112
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:30,600
It was really close.

113
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:34,943
This is what happens
when you two try to outsmart me, see?

114
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:36,513
Hey, where's Keith?

115
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:37,878
No idea.

116
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,852
I followed you and entered
that courtyard below...

117
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,388
and I found you unconscious
because of the fog.

118
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:46,653
There was nobody else there.
It's totally deserted.

119
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:54,392
No Spika there either?

120
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:58,597
That high-strung girl was with you too?
Well, no one's there.

121
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:03,403
And the worst part of it all is I can't find
any hint of a treasure anywhere!

122
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,670
No, we weren't after it to begin with...

123
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:09,473
What? You were not after a treasure?

124
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:12,074
Then, what on earth are you doing here?

125
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:14,847
Why were you inside
those dangerous ruins?

126
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:16,578
What, ruins?

127
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:29,767
What is this all about? I just don't know.

128
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:39,503
It's good...

129
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:44,905
Oh, yeah!

130
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:47,274
Oh, yeah!

131
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:48,876
Oh, baby.

132
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,280
Oh, yeah.

133
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:59,730
Oh, yeah, fuck me!

134
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:22,417
So, you're saying, Keith and Spika are
both imprisoned in that world?

135
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:28,050
Yeah... They vanished without a trace.
That's the only answer.

136
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:32,587
I can't believe it!

137
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,701
It's up to you to decide
if you want to believe it.

138
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,604
It's just that, I've heard that long ago
this village was totally destroyed...

139
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:44,905
by poisonous fog that suddenly burst
from the ground.

140
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:54,615
Since then, either because of the dead
villagers' curse or the poisonous fog...

141
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:56,917
travelers have been known to get lured in...

142
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:00,152
only to go mad and die
after a painful struggle.

143
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:10,400
Apparently, before they die,
they all say...

144
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,496
"I feel so good, as if I'm in a dream..."

145
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:16,167
Is that so? I'm happy for you.

146
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:27,011
Huh? You... that pretty girl!

147
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:32,057
Anyone who enters here finds pleasure.

148
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,889
I wonder how many men
I seduced and slept with...

149
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:37,986
But, my body's never satisfied...

150
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:42,456
You did?

151
00:13:42,802 --> 00:13:44,360
Borrowing that one's body...

152
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:49,136
I tried to feel the pleasure and pain
men failed to give me, but...

153
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,042
You borrowed her body?

154
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:54,375
I used her body and sought
pleasure from you...

155
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:58,377
but in vain, as usual.
It's not my body after all.

156
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:01,050
Why are you doing that?

157
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,317
I was born an aristocrat...

158
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:08,049
and because of that, I was raised
under the strict eye of my guardian.

159
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:13,030
And, before I could taste any freedom,
I was forced to marry for political reasons.

160
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,863
It turned out that the man I married was gay.

161
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:20,702
He'd lock me in my room while he brought
home man after man, night after night.

162
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,675
That's horrible...

163
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:27,804
Despite that, he was extremely jealous.

164
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,678
He'd whip me just because
I spoke to an errand boy...

165
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,184
then he'd chain me in a flooded basement.

166
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:36,681
At the end, he threw me out
and left me here.

167
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:45,228
So tell me, why do you cry?

168
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:49,860
I'm sorry for you... Come to me...

169
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:56,237
Every man took fright once I revealed who I
was, trembling and begging for forgiveness.

170
00:14:56,309 --> 00:15:01,372
They all went mad, turned crazy and died.
But, why not you...?

171
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:03,612
Hold my hand.

172
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,782
It's not possible.

173
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:10,686
It's possible. So long as we
understand each other. I'm sure...

174
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:19,286
Doesn't work.

175
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,261
Don't give up.

176
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:34,510
Why, it's warm...

177
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:37,775
You are so gentle.

178
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,582
You are so beautiful.

179
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:55,265
I can feel it.

180
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,871
Please be gentle...

181
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:08,812
It's unbelievable...

182
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:12,977
Oh no... I can feel it... don't...

183
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:14,144
Don't hurt me...

184
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:19,247
No, don't stop...

185
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:24,491
Oh, come quick!

186
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:34,163
I can feel it...

187
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:38,569
Oh, yeah.

188
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:41,201
It's good.

189
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:43,745
Good... it's good...

190
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:56,919
I feel it... l've never...

191
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:07,395
My lady, how far do we need to go?

192
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:10,909
I'm not sure, but we're not there yet.

193
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:17,174
I think this sword really misses him,
you know?

194
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:18,672
Really?

195
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:29,087
Oh, gramps, that way,
let's head towards that cliff, right over there.

196
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:30,921
Yes, my lady.

197
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,505
You're no longer translucent...

198
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,879
I can finally leave the earth... thank you.

199
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:56,583
What do you mean? You're finally...

200
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,018
I had to get my body back.

201
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:03,088
Without doing that,
the curse couldn't be broken.

202
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:07,259
I would've had to keep haunting this place
for ever and a day.

203
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:11,394
Now, finally, I can take my leave.

204
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:13,630
Thank you.

205
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:18,301
I'll go. But before I do, tell me your name.

206
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:23,777
Alright... Keith Ryan. And you?

207
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:28,510
It's Ellise, but I don't remember
my last name.

208
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:31,653
Ellise... it's a good name.

209
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:33,420
Nice to meet you.

210
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:50,942
After all I've done for you,
how dare you!

211
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,036
You're not a masseuse?

212
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,638
She brought me back from
the world of dead... A she-demon...

213
00:18:58,017 --> 00:18:59,279
A she-demon?

214
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:04,788
You've used me yourself, just as much,
and enjoyed the taste, didn't you?

215
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:07,884
You mean the pleasure victims I ate?

216
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,187
Ate?

217
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:28,042
That was just an hors d'oeuvre.

218
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:33,551
The main dish is your
resurrected bodies, pure...

219
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:39,788
Eating your bodies will give me
eternal youth and life.

220
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:42,419
That's why you brought me back...

221
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:48,157
It's promised to all demons.

222
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:53,402
Your white leg should be fried...
your brain, sherbet...

223
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:57,670
- your eyeballs and nipples for salad...
- Stop dreaming!

224
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,838
Stop it!

225
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:10,783
Don't interfere! I'll eat you up later, slowly.

226
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,225
But first, it's time to slaughter!

227
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:17,651
Shit!

228
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:22,230
Huh? What was that?
Big earthquake, wasn't it?

229
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:27,305
Look! The poisonous fog's clearing!

230
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:32,168
Thank god!
This thing's really uncomfortable...

231
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:43,446
Damn! It's that lady over there!

232
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:48,049
What a wreck of a place.

233
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:51,192
Hmm, there's someone over there.

234
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,160
It's here, I'm sure... Excuse me...

235
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,265
I think it might be here...

236
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:09,339
That's right. I'm certain it's here.

237
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:13,680
No way! Look at that!
Isn't that Keith's Shadow Blade?

238
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:15,413
What are you doing, my lady?

239
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:47,875
We've played enough. Now, die!

240
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:53,584
Watch out, my lady!

241
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:05,592
Shadow Blade?

242
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:14,202
Take this blow!

243
00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:40,668
Incredibly... powerful!

244
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,132
What really happened?

245
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:49,347
Humph? What was I doing?

246
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:54,617
Good-bye, Keith.

247
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,348
Good-bye, Ellise.

248
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:10,766
I just remembered... That girl.
She loves you. Did you know?

249
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:11,992
Did you?

250
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,171
Spika?

251
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:22,970
Thank you, Keith Ryan!

252
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:30,987
Spika? Spika?!

253
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:45,059
So, Spika loves me...

254
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,598
Keith...

255
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,360
Keith...

256
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:20,938
Oh, yes, that feels so good!

257
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:29,336
Oh, yes.

258
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:36,116
I've been waiting for so long.
Keith, I love you!

259
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:37,155
Spika...

260
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:46,956
Please be gentle...

261
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:52,493
No... don't hurt me...

262
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:58,165
Don't worry... You're so wet.
See, you can hear it...

263
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:03,880
Oh, yes!

264
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:08,141
Oh, no.

265
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:14,352
Oh, no...

266
00:25:18,764 --> 00:25:21,631
Oh, no, it hurts... don't tease.

267
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:26,460
Don't stop... it's big... l'm bursting...

268
00:25:31,944 --> 00:25:32,933
Oh, yeah!

269
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:47,554
I'm full! Don't... don't...

270
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:48,915
Oh, yeah.

271
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:00,838
Yes, yes!

272
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:04,998
I'm coming...

273
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:16,852
But really, Keith and Spika,
where did they go?

274
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:19,721
I'm sure they'll eventually show up.

275
00:26:36,642 --> 00:26:41,773
But he's... but he's... my Mr. Angel...
