1
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:06,469
Please punish me.

5
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,337
You want me to do it?

6
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:43,983
It is finally time
for my lifelong research to bloom!

7
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:46,178
Yeah, but...

8
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,515
What, are you discontent with that?

9
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:52,787
You will fight evil for justice
as Super Andmaid Aki!

10
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,591
Super Andmaid, like...

11
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:04,894
Here I go!

12
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:19,375
Professor, you sure there aren't any quirks?

13
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,082
Leave it to me!

14
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:39,303
Kowaremono II - Fragile Hearts II
Heaven-2

15
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:55,845
I'm Aki! An Andmaid.

16
00:03:56,056 --> 00:03:58,286
Actually, I should scrap by now...

17
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:02,692
...but Professor claimed me,
and I live here a his research facility.

18
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:08,063
He is a very kind person, but...

19
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:13,771
...when it comes to his research,
his screws are a bit loose...

20
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:18,378
...but I'm grateful that he picked me up,
so I'll do my best to serve him.

21
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,776
Is this...

22
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:23,746
Aki! Come over here!

23
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,908
Yes!

24
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:30,757
I'm coming!

25
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:34,485
I'm coming right now!

26
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,691
What is this?

27
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:45,198
Forty-eight years of toil...

28
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:46,863
...much research, it's finally done.

29
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,807
The fruit of all modern science!

30
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:53,777
Don't worry, just put that on your left wrist!

31
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:54,914
Yes!

32
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:56,950
Like this?

33
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:07,488
Professor! It stuck to me on its own
and now won't come off!

34
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:08,752
I made that bracelet...

35
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:11,696
...so that unless I say the keyword,
it won't come off.

36
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:12,594
No way!

37
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:16,164
Please, say the keyword, Professor!

38
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:21,403
Listen up, Aki! Raise the bracelet high
in the air and repeat the following!

39
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:22,533
Here comes Aki!

40
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:23,701
Protector of Justice;
evil is unforgivable!

41
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:25,506
I will defend world peace!

42
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:29,140
Super Andmaid, Aki!

43
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:32,617
I'm supposed to say that?

44
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:35,185
Shut up and just say it!

45
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,517
Yes. Like this?

46
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,915
Here comes Aki!

47
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:48,957
Protector of Justice; evil is unforgivable!
I will defend world peace!

48
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:54,668
Super Andmaid, Aki!

49
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:58,504
This is! But it's a bit risquй.

50
00:05:58,578 --> 00:06:03,481
That bracelet utilizes a highly rare element
as its source of energy...

51
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:09,079
...and allows you to transform
by reconstructing your molecular structure!

52
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:11,816
And then? What happens after I transform?

53
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,518
Don't tell me that all I can do is transform.

54
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:21,791
So then what?
I get to fly, gain superhuman strength...

55
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:24,098
...and shoot beams from my eyes, right?

56
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:28,835
It's not impossible for you to do that, but...

57
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,438
What am I supposed to do?

58
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:35,277
For that, I need to do some modifications...

59
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:37,842
Modifications?

60
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:39,482
Dick! Clit! Ass!

61
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:42,417
Professor...

62
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:48,626
Well, simple modifications like that
will only take 2 to 3 days.

63
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:54,559
All right, that being that,
time to get back to work!

64
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,697
Professor! I'm cheering you on!

65
00:06:57,804 --> 00:06:59,635
Okay! Leave it up to me!

66
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:04,335
I don't have much faith, but this looks fun.

67
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:23,085
Super Andmaid.

68
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:38,934
Professor. I brought you a late-night snack.

69
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:44,015
You shouldn't push yourself too hard.
It's bad for your health.

70
00:07:57,964 --> 00:08:00,228
Good night.

71
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:07,738
All right! It's finished!

72
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:10,975
Congratulations, Professor!

73
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:15,740
Now, when you transform,
you should be able to display new abilities.

74
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:17,879
Thank you!

75
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:21,579
Do you best for the sake of world peace!

76
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:28,823
Yes, Professor! But I don't think
you'll be seeing me in action much.

77
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:33,758
Well, let's hope so.

78
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:37,034
I have prepared for you
instructional videos and data...

79
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:40,504
...so be sure to read them!

80
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:41,774
Yes!

81
00:08:49,282 --> 00:08:50,442
Let's go, everyone!

82
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,345
Otakki Rangers, go!

83
00:08:57,424 --> 00:09:00,723
Professor, is this really data?

84
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:13,805
Good morning, Professor!

85
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,271
Look at this, Aki!

86
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:27,252
"Robot Strikes Bank"...

87
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:30,088
Professor, this is...

88
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:34,525
It looks like there is someone
who is trying to disturb our peace.

89
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:38,596
Now is the time for Super Andmaid Aki
to rise to occasion!

90
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:42,601
But, don't you think the timing
is a bit too good?

91
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:45,066
You think so?

92
00:09:52,178 --> 00:09:53,839
It's the drive-in down below!

93
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:55,778
Go! Super Andmaid Aki!

94
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:57,440
Yes!

95
00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:59,245
Here comes Aki!

96
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:02,221
Protector of Justice, evil is unforgivable!

97
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:06,749
I will defend world peace!

98
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:12,088
Super Andmaid, Aki!

99
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,595
Then, I'm going!

100
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:16,929
I'm counting on you, Aki!

101
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:17,992
Yes!

102
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:35,249
Looks like she's gone.

103
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:39,591
Yes, Professor?

104
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:43,588
Just as planned, Aki has headed over there.

105
00:10:43,663 --> 00:10:44,960
Proceed as planned.

106
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:47,431
Roger! I'm supposed to lure her
to the base, right?

107
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,333
Yes. Make sure you don't arouse her suspicion.

108
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,437
Understood.

109
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:57,275
You, wait up!

110
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:06,346
Those who dare disturb the world's peace
are unforgivable!

111
00:11:06,686 --> 00:11:11,521
Super Andmaid Aki will serve you!

112
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:23,325
A bit strong, aren't we?

113
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:36,213
What should I do? It even has a gun.

114
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:40,241
That's right! This has some sort
of transceiver.

115
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:44,284
Professor! Professor!

116
00:11:44,357 --> 00:11:47,849
The caller you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

117
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:52,091
I'm researching,
so please leave a message after the beep!

118
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:54,429
Professor!

119
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:03,308
Worse comes to worse,
actions speak louder than words!

120
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:16,219
Service Punch!

121
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:28,357
Incredible! I really am powered-up!

122
00:12:32,405 --> 00:12:35,374
Your evil-doing days are numbered!

123
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:44,840
Hey, wait up! So can I!

124
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:49,315
Come back here!

125
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:08,363
So this their secret hideout!

126
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,266
All right.

127
00:13:45,478 --> 00:13:49,312
Intruder alert!
All hands capture the intruder!

128
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:52,447
Intruder alert!
All hands capture the intruder!

129
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:03,428
It looks like it's over for you.

130
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:04,964
Who are you?

131
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:08,867
The dead need not to know.

132
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:14,834
Super Andmaid Aki, so long!

133
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,744
Where?

134
00:14:31,524 --> 00:14:33,515
Have you come to now?

135
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:37,352
There you are!

136
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,738
My, my, what a lively young girl we have here.

137
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:58,575
You still seem to have spunk,
so next why don't you have fun with this.

138
00:15:11,431 --> 00:15:13,661
This is...

139
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:37,549
This.

140
00:15:37,624 --> 00:15:39,524
This has no end.

141
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:42,186
Plus I feel kind of weak.

142
00:15:50,603 --> 00:15:53,037
I'm losing my strength!

143
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:03,409
No! What are you?

144
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,623
No!

145
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,289
No!

146
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,147
That's, no!

147
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:55,490
It has begun.

148
00:16:55,668 --> 00:16:57,932
Stop it

149
00:16:58,204 --> 00:17:01,139
No! Not there!

150
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:51,582
What is the matter, lively young girl?

151
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:55,019
You!

152
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:58,586
It looks like you have grown weak.

153
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:02,725
Slowly fall into the pits of ecstasy
in this underground dungeon.

154
00:19:51,677 --> 00:19:53,975
Professor.

155
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:56,713
It has been a week since we captured Aki.

156
00:19:57,216 --> 00:19:58,205
Yes.

157
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,193
Yeah, it feels good.

158
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,958
It feels so good!

159
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:22,340
It seems like the time is right.

160
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:30,038
That's good! Yes! Oh, yes!

161
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:32,350
Let's go!

162
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:50,562
You're...!

163
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:52,763
You look great.

164
00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:55,931
How does it feel to be raped
for one week straight?

165
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,369
Your energy should have charged.

166
00:20:58,544 --> 00:21:01,707
Why don't you transform into a super heroine?

167
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:07,316
Here comes Aki!

168
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:11,988
Protector of Justice; evil is unforgivable!

169
00:21:12,224 --> 00:21:15,853
I will defend world peace!

170
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:20,888
Super Andmaid, Aki!

171
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:24,636
I won't let you have your way!

172
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:28,229
So you can at least transform.

173
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:33,774
But do you really think
that you can fight with that body, young lady?

174
00:21:44,957 --> 00:21:47,448
That face is superb!

175
00:22:00,573 --> 00:22:05,567
Now, I think it's time
for your body to serve me.

176
00:22:06,245 --> 00:22:09,408
I will thoroughly enjoy this.

177
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:05,967
Yes!

178
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:15,035
Yes!

179
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:37,001
My ass! My ass feels so good!

180
00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:40,937
The same person who said
she was going to defend world peace...

181
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:45,067
...is in ecstasy being fingered in the ass.

182
00:23:45,211 --> 00:23:48,203
What a shameful protector of justice!

183
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:43,463
What's wrong? What do you want me to do,
protector of justice?

184
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:49,702
Please, in my ass!

185
00:24:49,842 --> 00:24:54,370
It looks like you don't understand your position.

186
00:24:54,446 --> 00:24:56,539
Beg for it!

187
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:59,311
Say that you are a slutty whore!

188
00:25:00,152 --> 00:25:06,990
I say that, I will defend world peace, yet...

189
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:10,128
...am a slutty whore who...

190
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:14,690
...loves it up the ass!

191
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:19,067
Please, please stick it in my ass!

192
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:22,766
Do you pledge your loyalty to me?

193
00:25:23,209 --> 00:25:29,944
I will, for your dick. So please!

194
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:37,412
I'm your loyal slave.

195
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:40,158
All right.

196
00:25:40,226 --> 00:25:45,163
Since you vowed your loyalty,
here is your reward.

197
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:48,667
Master!

198
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:51,563
Master!

199
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:57,633
My ass feels good. I'm so embarrassed.

200
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:06,007
It's over, Aki!

201
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:25,801
Professor!

202
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:29,799
Well, that was fun wasn't it Aki?

203
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:32,574
Why did you do this?

204
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:36,237
It's just my taste.

205
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:40,513
No way!

206
00:26:56,135 --> 00:26:58,069
Hold it there!

207
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:00,438
What?

208
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:07,501
I won't forgive those who disturb
the world's peace!

209
00:27:08,914 --> 00:27:11,439
What is this chick saying?

210
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:12,814
Hey, what're you doing?

211
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:13,817
Let go, hey!

212
00:27:13,886 --> 00:27:15,877
Let go of us!

213
00:27:16,622 --> 00:27:19,352
What the hell are you?

214
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:21,484
I defend world peace!

215
00:27:21,894 --> 00:27:24,624
Please, both of you...

216
00:27:24,897 --> 00:27:26,660
...rape me.

217
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:33,270
World peace feels good.
