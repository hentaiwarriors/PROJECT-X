1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,540
I'm Yuzuriha Mizuki, the new
nurse at the university infirmary.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,340
In addition to the usual nursing,
I'm sort of a counselor as well.

3
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,180
Somehow, the infirmary has become
the place to come for advice on sex...

4
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,450
...and I've had some strange
relationships with the female students...

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,060
...and Ms. Tsuchiya, a teacher.

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,070
Recently I noticed a male student,
Kirishima, and he's been on my mind.

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,700
Good morning, Ms. Mizuki.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,600
Good morning.

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,640
Good morning, Ms. Mizuki.

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,500
Good morning.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,500
Good morning.

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,410
Oh, Kirishima.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,260
I guess they got together.

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,650
Ms. Mizuki!

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:02,990
Uh, yes?

16
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,830
Mr. Endo...

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,320
What's wrong?

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,030
You look a little dazed...

19
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,530
No, it's nothing...

20
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,100
You look depressed.

21
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,740
Why don't you, me and Ms.
Tuschiya go to karaoke after school?

22
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,270
That'll cheer you up.

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,100
Sounds good.

24
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,440
See you after school...

25
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,450
.

26
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,120
Ouch!

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,110
That hurt, Ms.Mizuki!

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,390
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,530
You all right?

30
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,060
There's something
wrong with you today.

31
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,530
What's wrong?

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,470
Is something on your mind?

33
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,370
Why do you come in here every
day when nothing is wrong with you?

34
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not in any extra-cirrucular
clubs, so I don't have anything to do.

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,210
But that's not...

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,880
Ms. Mizuki...

37
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,310
M-Ms. Tsuchiya.

38
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,550
Are you finished?

39
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,350
Let's go drinking.

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,260
But I still have a student...

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,830
Here, don't forget to lock up.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,730
M-Ms. Tsuchiya.

43
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,670
Ms. Mizuki, I don't think
it's good to drink so much.

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,390
Ya know, young girls these days
have too much experience with sex.

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,320
Sounds like you're frustrated.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,120
They just come in
to tell me their stories...

47
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,460
...I hardly ever get a
serious consultation.

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,070
What are you talking about?

49
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,590
Even if it's about sex,
they're really concerned.

50
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,700
Even me...

51
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,870
We all appreciate you
listening to our stories.

52
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,400
Y-You think?

53
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,210
So I guess it's not
such a waste of time.

54
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,650
Yeah, so I don't
understand what the problem is.

55
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,190
M-Ms. Mizuki...

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,990
Cheer up.

57
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:33,070
Mr. Endo would be shocked if he
knew I talked to you about dumping him.

58
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,970
You can't tell him.

59
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,510
Don't worry.

60
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,750
He's pretty naive
about those kinds of things.

61
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,080
You're horrible.

62
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,350
But, he is a good man.

63
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,250
Even after I dumped
him, we're still friends.

64
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,350
He was worried about you.

65
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,120
He said you looked depressed.

66
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,620
Hmm...

67
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,130
So, what's on your mind, huh?

68
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,070
Uh, er, it's nothing, really.

69
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,940
L-Let's drink some more.

70
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,490
What?

71
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,560
I'm being touched.

72
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,560
Who?

73
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,630
Kirishima?

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,300
Why, Kirishima?

75
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,160
Oh no, I'm naked!

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,300
N-No.

77
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,470
S-Stop.

78
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,980
Stop!

79
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,320
Oh no, I can't control my body.

80
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,460
Kirishima's touch makes me so horny.

81
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,990
I can hear my heart beating.

82
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,640
Something hot is coming inside me.

83
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,430
I can't believe it.

84
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,870
It's my first time, but I'm so wet.

85
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,810
I can't believe I feel so good.

86
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,320
Oh, god, it was just a dream.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,660
What was. Did I...

88
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,100
D-Did the booze make me...

89
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,380
I shouldn't drink so much.

90
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,390
I left in such a hurry, I didn't ask...

91
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,490
...but I wonder what happened?

92
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,330
How am I going to face Mr. Endo?

93
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,430
Yes?

94
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,470
Excuse me.

95
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,430
M-Mr. Endo!

96
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,680
Ms. Mizuki, do you have a minute?

97
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,540
Yes, come in.

98
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,420
Er, uh, mmm, well...

99
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,250
Awfully humid today, isn't it?

100
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,450
Yes, uuuh, errr, it's uuuh...

101
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,920
Well...

102
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,290
Actually, I want to
talk about the other day.

103
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,070
Sorry, I don't remember a thing.

104
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:54,830
What?

105
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,650
I thought maybe we
could go to the movies.

106
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,120
So I will see you in front
of the theater on Sunday.

107
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,170
Did he just ask me out?

108
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,400
Sunday...

109
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,700
Oh, crap!

110
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,140
I have to return the book to the library.

111
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,520
Yes, it is Kirishima.

112
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,620
He wears glasses.

113
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,330
He looks different...

114
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,500
...so serious.

115
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,330
He's smiling.

116
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,360
He's thinking about something.

117
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,510
Looks like he's having a good time.

118
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm sleepy.

119
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,250
I wonder how it's going
with Kirishima and Yoshinori.

120
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Oh, I guess I fell asleep.

121
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,530
Please stop.

122
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,000
What is that?

123
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,410
Do you want it?

124
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:40,940
I do.

125
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Okay, get on the desk.

126
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,820
Are you ready?

127
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,890
Hey, raise your ass.

128
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,770
I'm coming, I'm coming.

129
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,280
I'm coming!

130
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,180
Jeez!

131
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,550
I feel much better.

132
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,790
Really, kids these days do it anywhere.

133
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,600
Fortunately, they didn't
notice I was sleeping here.

134
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,660
By the way, I wonder
who put this on me?

135
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,670
What?

136
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,320
Kirishima, what are you doing?

137
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,890
Well, I just came in for some aspirin.

138
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,020
Ms. Mizuki's not here?

139
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,220
N-No, looks like she's out.

140
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,760
I put my jacket around her
because she looked cold in the library.

141
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,500
I can't go home without it.

142
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,300
So did you take any aspirin?

143
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,940
No, I can't get it without permission.

144
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,940
Don't worry, it's just aspirin.

145
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,020
Here, asprin and water.

146
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,180
Thank you.

147
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,390
So is it going well with Yoshinari?

148
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,630
I see you together
all the time these days.

149
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,630
You guys are going out, right?

150
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,800
Y-Yeah, we've been talking a
lot lately, but we're just friends.

151
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,240
Oh, really?

152
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,640
Yoshinari hasn't told
him how she feels yet.

153
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,720
She must really like him a lot.

154
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,180
We talk about video games and music.

155
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,680
We have so much in common.

156
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,910
Is that so?

157
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,550
I guess Kirishima is pretty dense.

158
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,060
I have to go.

159
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,160
Why don't you lie down till
your headache goes away?

160
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,030
Is it okay, without permission?

161
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,330
Don't worry about it.

162
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,340
Ms. Mizuki sleeps there all the time.

163
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,850
I wonder if she sleeps in this bed.

164
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,620
Oh, what am I doing?

165
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,630
What's this?

166
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,530
What's up with that jacket?

167
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,570
Nothing.

168
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,300
I was just asked to hold on to it.

169
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,760
Please don't touch it.

170
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,940
Anyway, you wanted to talk to me?

171
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,210
Well, I just...

172
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,880
Is it girl talk?

173
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,210
How do you know?

174
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,240
Well...

175
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,380
I want to ask your advice.

176
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,220
Okay.

177
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,290
Am I a loser?

178
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:45,660
What?

179
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,960
Well, it's always great in the
beginning, but it never lasts.

180
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,060
Like, she'll get a boyfriend...

181
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,200
I can't win...

182
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,700
...because I don't have a...

183
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,900
...you know.

184
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,240
I don't think it's just that.

185
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,210
You think there's a
problem with my personality?

186
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,680
Well, yes...

187
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,150
I have feelings too.

188
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,650
I understand that.

189
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,190
So can you comfort me?

190
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,370
I-I can't do that, Ms. Tsuchiya.

191
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,860
Why?

192
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,900
Don't you remember
having sex me with that night?

193
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,260
You were so into it.

194
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,400
We were sleeping
naked, does that mean...

195
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,540
I took off your clothes.

196
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,230
I wonder if Ms. Mizuki's back.

197
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,980
Stop, Ms. Tsuchiya.

198
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,340
I have to stop?

199
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,360
S-Someone's watching.

200
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,710
See you tomorrow.

201
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,880
I'll buy you lunch.

202
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,080
Thanks!

203
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,120
Okay, you can come out now.

204
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,360
Well, Ms. Mizuki.

205
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,160
I'm going to have you
come with me for a bit.

206
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,940
This is Ms. Mizuki's room.

207
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,890
What should I do?

208
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,260
Kirishima saw me.

209
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,040
So what did you see?

210
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,330
Well...

211
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,610
Y-You saw everything, didn't you?

212
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,810
It may seem a little strange,
but it's a kind of counseling...

213
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,710
The rumor is true, isn't it?

214
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,550
What rumor?

215
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,390
That you're a lesbian.

216
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,950
W-Who said that?

217
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,630
I wonder who it is?

218
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,300
A delivery?

219
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,770
Ms. Mizuki.

220
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,370
We've come to hang out.

221
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,480
Let us in.

222
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,240
Hide yourself, Kirishima.
Let us in!

223
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,280
Hi, Ms. Mizuki.

224
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,990
Jeezus!

225
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,220
Please listen to her, Ms. Mizuki.

226
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,060
Okay, okay.

227
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,650
You shouldn't drink so much.

228
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:49,640
That stupid Kirishima doesn't
even know how much I like him.

229
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,970
Why did I fall in love
with such a dense fool?

230
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,510
Oh well.

231
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,990
God, I had know idea she felt that way.

232
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,470
You didn't notice?

233
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,640
I thought we were friends.

234
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,070
And...

235
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,410
Is there someone else?

236
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,480
Yeah, there's someone on my mind.

237
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,310
I-Is that so.

238
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,690
I-If you like her, you've got go for it.

239
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,190
But, she's a little dense.

240
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,120
Then go for it with everything you have.

241
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,560
She's an older woman.

242
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,500
That doesn't matter if you like her.

243
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,960
Rumor has it she's gay.

244
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,700
Then show her
how good a man can be.

245
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,010
She's a teacher.

246
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,170
Yeah, but I like you,
and you're a student...

247
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,140
The woman you have on
your mind, is it Ms. Tsuchiya?

248
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,680
Well?

249
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,220
She's very dense.

250
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,890
So, is it true that you're a lesbian?

251
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,470
Well, it's a...

252
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,200
Why don't we find out?

253
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,430
Ms. Mizuki...

254
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,320
My heart is beating so fast.

255
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,780
I'm embarrassed, being touched there...

256
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,490
It's so hot it feels like it's on fire.

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,900
Oh, no, I'm all wet.

258
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,370
I can't stand it any more.

259
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,630
Come inside me, Kirishima.

260
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,010
Ouch!

261
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,940
Are you okay?

262
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,180
It doesn't matter, do as you like.

263
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,630
Ms. Mizuki, I'm coming.

264
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,500
Come!

265
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,140
I'm coming!

266
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,750
Ms. Mizuki.

267
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,720
Good morning.

268
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,480
Ms. Tsuchiya...

269
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,180
Good morning.

270
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,460
Something wrong?

271
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,060
You're especially
beautiful today, Ms. Mizuki.

272
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,660
Did you change your make-up?

273
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,430
No, not really.

274
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,130
Something's different.

275
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,030
Did you get a boyfriend?

276
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,050
No, that's not it...

277
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,040
Come on, tell me all about it.

278
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,850
What are you saying, Ms. Tsuchiya?

279
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,150
Hey, wait a minute.

280
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,330
Even if it's the same everyday,
today's lunch tasted particularly good.

281
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,400
Yes.

282
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,070
Ms. Mizuki, may I?

283
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,070
Yes, come in.

284
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,810
About our movie date...

285
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,120
...and what time we should meet...

286
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,320
Yes?

287
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,700
I thought we could have lunch before
the movie, so how about noon-ish?

288
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,100
Sure, sounds good to me.

289
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,970
Okay, then we'll meet at the
cafe across from the station.

290
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,100
See you Sunday.

291
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,280
I'm looking forward to it, right?

292
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,140
It's okay to have lunch with him.

293
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,950
Ms. Mizuki...

294
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,750
W-What's wrong, Yoshinari?

295
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,430
You don't like me?

296
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,630
Sorry, I never thought of you that way.

297
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,400
So then...

298
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,730
He dumped me.

299
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,070
D-Don't be so disappointed.

300
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,380
It's okay.

301
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,680
I sort of knew.

302
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,980
I just thought he was the best
man to have sex with for the first time.

303
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,090
Now...

304
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,420
Ms. Mizuki...

305
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,450
What?

306
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,120
Make me forget about Mr. Kirishima.

307
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,000
Is it all right?

308
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,600
Please, Ms. Mizuki.

309
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,000
All right...

310
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,410
Yoshinari, you know what...

311
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,480
I can do as I like, right, Ms. Mizuki?

312
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,980
I guess, if that'll make you happy.

313
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,130
We're both girls, so why...

314
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,870
It's so hot down there.

315
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,840
It's all wet and
slippery and feels so good.

316
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,090
Thanks, Ms. Mizuki.

317
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,530
I feel so much better.

318
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,570
I'm so tired.

319
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,970
What's going on Ms. Mizuki?

320
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,440
You look tired.

321
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,640
Oh no, nothing really...

322
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,750
Oh, yeah.

323
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,090
There's somewhere I want to take you.

324
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,420
Do you have time on Sunday?

325
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,550
What?

326
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,680
S-Sunday?

327
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,440
Okay, so I promised to
meet Kirishima at 4:00...

328
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,110
I can make it there
after the movie, right?

329
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,220
I'll have to since I promised.

330
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,290
Sorry, Ms. Mizuki.

331
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,190
Waiting long?

332
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,490
Not long, I just got here.

333
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,300
We still have time, right?

334
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,840
Yes, we can get to the
theater an hour before the movie.

335
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,410
Are you ready to order?

336
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,370
Coffee, please.

337
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,870
Sure.

338
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,140
I haven't been to the
movies for a long time.

339
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,630
Kirishima.

340
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,300
Are you okay?

341
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,560
Ms. Mizuki?

342
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,830
No, I'm fine.

343
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,670
Would you like to
get something to eat?

344
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,070
Yes.

345
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,980
Let me see...

346
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,850
What would you like?

347
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,710
W-Well, I guess the spaghetti soup.

348
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,250
Stop, Kirishima.

349
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,020
Not here...

350
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,550
What?

351
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,500
Oh no, I can't believe I moaned.

352
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,140
Are you okay Ms. Mizuki?

353
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,100
Yes.

354
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,070
N-No.

355
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,120
Uh, Ms. Mizuki?

356
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,420
Thank you very much.

357
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,430
Um, Mr. Endo...

358
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,320
I'm sorry...

359
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,370
...but I'm in love with someone else.

360
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Endo.

361
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,870
But...

362
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,450
S-Sorry, are you upset?

363
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,090
Come to think about it, I don't
even know how you feel about me.

364
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,360
I-I said it.

365
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,420
What?

366
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,940
I said it.

367
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,400
...to Mr. Endo, that
I'm in love with someone.

368
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,280
Ms. Mizuki.

369
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,480
I have a favor.

370
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,480
Can I ask it?

371
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,610
Yes.

372
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,530
Why did you bring me here
in the middle of the afternoon?

373
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,420
You said I could ask you a favor, right?

374
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,130
Yes, I did, but...

375
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,290
And...

376
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,200
What?

377
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,510
What is he thinking,
wanting to bathe with me?

378
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,180
Ms. Mizuki...

379
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,390
Let me wash you.

380
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:13,980
Okay.

381
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,710
AIready?

382
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,370
Not yet?

383
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,270
No, it's okay.

384
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,990
It feels so good!

385
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,310
I'm coming, I'm coming!

386
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,310
Mr. Kirishima, you're...

387
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,240
Yes?

388
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,450
You're pretty sleazy.

389
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,190
And pretty experienced too.

390
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,290
You don't like it?

391
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,120
That sort of thing?

392
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,960
Meanie!

393
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,860
Haven't you forgotten something?

394
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,560
Mr. Endo!

395
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,750
What's wrong, Ms. Takeuchi?

396
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,490
You're in such a rush.

397
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,550
I have a question about the next class.

398
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,790
Okay, it's...

399
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,870
It's hard dealing with an intern.

400
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,840
I wish I had a female intern.

401
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:19,510
You're not thinking of hitting on
her because she's cute, are you?

402
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,410
You don't trust me, do you?

403
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,550
I've heard that you
seduce female students.

404
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,320
Okay, so I should prepare the papers.

405
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,730
And did you prepare
answer sheets from last time?

406
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,390
Oh!

407
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,850
You forgot, huh?

408
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,360
I'll do it right now.

409
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,020
Watch out!

410
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,230
You okay?

411
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,860
No need to be in such a hurry.

412
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,170
Calm down, okay.

413
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,480
Yes.

414
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,640
And so the intern's time passed...

415
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,850
Ms. Takeuchi, don't
you have a boyfriend?

416
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,930
I'm single.

417
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,190
Do you know somebody good?

418
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,360
How about Mr. Endo?

419
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,160
I heard Ms. Tsuchiya dumped him.

420
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,160
Oh yeah?

421
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,370
I heard things are
going well with Ms. Mizuki.

422
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,730
Really?

423
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,040
And the interns finally
completed their training...

424
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,210
Cheers!

425
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,260
Mr. Endo, thank you for
taking such good care of me.

426
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,070
You're welcome.

427
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,370
You worked hard.

428
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,130
You think so?

429
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,000
Yes, you did a good job, Ms. Takeuchi.

430
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,770
Yes, good job.

431
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,540
Yep, by the way, Ms. Mizuki...

432
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,210
Let's drink a lot tonight.

433
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,790
I can't drink so much.

434
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,420
Oh, come on.

435
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,000
Okay, so you'll take her to the station.

436
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,360
Jeez...

437
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,660
See you.

438
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,570
Take it easy.

439
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,930
Oh, are you okay, Ms. Takeuchi?

440
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:33,810
Mr. Endo, where should we go next?

441
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,640
What are you saying?

442
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,150
You're drunk already.

443
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,840
What?

444
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,580
You don't want to drink with me?

445
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,150
Ms. Takeuchi, are you an angry drunk?

446
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,490
Anyway, come with me.

447
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,370
Uh, Ms. Takeuchi...

448
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,470
I don't think it's good idea.

449
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,980
It doesn't really
matter what you think...

450
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:03,840
What?

451
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,540
When a girl likes someone...

452
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,250
...she wants it.

453
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,980
Wants what?

454
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:13,680
Wants that!

455
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,080
S-Stop it!

456
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,120
Mr. Endo, you're getting a little lively.

457
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,950
Well, it's a...

458
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,860
Looks yummy!

459
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,300
I'm gonna have some.

460
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,810
Mr. Endo, please.

461
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,540
She's wet through her panties.

462
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,470
Mr. Endo, that feels good.

463
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,280
Ms. Takeuchi.

464
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,140
You can put it in.

465
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,250
Make me come...

466
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,040
Oh, no.

467
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,610
I'm coming.

468
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,410
I'm coming!

469
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,110
I bet Mr. Endo did it with her.

470
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,750
She definitely had her eye on him.

471
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,860
M-Ms. Takeuchi...

472
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,820
But I want more.

473
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:03,700
No more?

474
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,230
I didn't say that, but...

475
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:08,930
No more?

476
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,240
I don't say that, but...

477
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,630
Then let's go drink more at your place.
