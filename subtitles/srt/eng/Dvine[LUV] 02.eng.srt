1
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:30,818
Is that why you are almost always
confined in the mansion?

2
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,384
Yes. I easily take ill,
ever since when I was born.

3
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:42,363
My father created this garden for me...

4
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:45,161
so that I can see it from my room.

5
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,366
This branch?

6
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:49,934
Yes.

7
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,400
Thank you, Mr. Hyde.

8
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,274
You're welcome.

9
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,944
Miss Mia.

10
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:05,586
Hi, Priol.

11
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,248
It's about time for you
to get back to your room.

12
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,492
See you later, Mr. Hyde.

13
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:18,098
Yeah.

14
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:28,475
Mr. Hyde, you will come visit me again,
won't you?

15
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:30,513
Of course.

16
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:32,946
Good. See you then.

17
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:43,093
She's a good girl.

18
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:45,752
It was Miss Mia who helped you
when you fell into our carriage.

19
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,759
If it hadn't been for Miss Mia,
I wouldn't have...

20
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:52,627
Helped a stranger from nowhere,
is that it?

21
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:55,772
If you really wish to show gratitude...

22
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,274
please save Miss Mia's life.

23
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,901
What do I need to do?

24
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:31,440
They say it's a miracle medicine
that cures any disease.

25
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:38,974
Elixir?

26
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:53,263
The only person who might know
about Elixir would be Serafias.

27
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,024
She's something of a witch.

28
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,333
She lives in the forest, south of town.

29
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,230
Thanks.

30
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:04,999
Mr. Hyde.

31
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,743
Hey, you don't have to be on guard like that.

32
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:15,147
I'm Ghuran. Why don't you
have a drink with me?

33
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:19,823
I've seen you before. Many times.

34
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:21,184
Where?

35
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,090
In the cave, of course.
You are in the same trade, aren't you?

36
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:27,125
Yeah, sort of.

37
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:31,234
I rarely see guys entering
those caves alone.

38
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:33,998
I was wondering if you're sane.

39
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,836
Which means, you are...

40
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:52,588
I belong to a small band of thieves,
though I'm by myself tonight.

41
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:10,001
You're after the Treasure
of the Ancient World too?

42
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:13,971
Sort of. What about you?

43
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:16,872
Well, nothing so far.

44
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:21,312
I see. Tough luck for both of us.

45
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:22,716
Yeah.

46
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:27,685
Or maybe you're trying to fool me.

47
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:30,924
Well, fine by me.

48
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:33,327
I have one more question.

49
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:37,491
You know there's a huge door
on the Second Level.

50
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:40,727
That door was opened yesterday.

51
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:46,132
It never opened before,
no matter what we tried.

52
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,010
What could have been inside?

53
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:54,413
Why do you ask me that?

54
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:57,248
Well, why not?

55
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:11,960
I have no idea.

56
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:17,268
I see. Too bad.

57
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:22,641
Next time, I'll pay.

58
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,879
Maybe he was talking about Eura's.

59
00:05:31,155 --> 00:05:35,489
Shush, Sakra! Don't mention Eura in public.

60
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,526
Okay, I got it.

61
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:48,333
What do you think, Hyde?

62
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,004
You cut her hair?

63
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,546
But what's that weird dress?

64
00:05:57,848 --> 00:05:59,475
I'm sorry it's weird.

65
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,144
I used to wear that years ago.

66
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:08,186
Wow, Dr. Shizki once wore
such a flowery dress...

67
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,692
I want you to go find the cane
I dropped in the cave.

68
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:50,323
Then you'll mix the Elixir for me?

69
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,843
That would be the 28th.

70
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:19,288
Here it is.

71
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:33,435
Where is your leader?

72
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:36,243
What do you want?

73
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:39,848
I need the amulet he has.

74
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,243
I don't know about it.

75
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:44,884
What about a woman covered with tattoos?

76
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:46,853
I don't know.

77
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,792
I don't know anything about
an amulet or a woman like that.

78
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:54,091
I see. Then I don't need you.

79
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:11,572
Wait, Slain.

80
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:29,055
You know my name?

81
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,125
Of course! How could I forget?

82
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,700
Three years ago, in the Kattoosh ruins!

83
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,702
You killed all my friends.

84
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:48,243
Then why don't you die, too?

85
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:00,861
Net yet.

86
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:02,293
You.

87
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:08,567
Slowly, Hyde.

88
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:23,644
Well, at the very least, her ribs are broken.

89
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,316
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to slap me tonight?

90
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,489
Hyde, is it dangerous in the cave?

91
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,828
That's an unexpected question.

92
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,090
That girl, she was the sole survivor,
wasn't she?

93
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:13,600
Yeah. So far.
I've been to many ruins and caves, but...

94
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,396
It's here, the Ancient World
ruin is waiting for me here!

95
00:10:17,474 --> 00:10:19,999
Of course, many guys have
their sights set on them!

96
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,171
So, there will be some danger!

97
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,374
But I'm going to do it!

98
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:36,022
That man in the tavern,
and Slain the wizard.

99
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:47,803
I found the cane you were talking about.

100
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:50,305
This is it, right?

101
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:54,400
Yes, this is it.

102
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,139
Okay, now the Elixir...

103
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:00,107
One more.

104
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:02,778
That's not what we agreed.

105
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,121
What?

106
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:12,419
I'm not saying I won't give it to you.
I ran out of something I need.

107
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:14,589
I want you to go get it.

108
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:17,065
Okay, okay. What is it, then?

109
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,434
A virgin's lust juice.

110
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:26,641
Can I ask you?

111
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,673
How would I go get such a thing?

112
00:11:36,353 --> 00:11:38,321
It's up to you.

113
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:44,826
Lust juice. Lust juice. Lust juice.

114
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:46,589
Lust juice?

115
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,788
Finally, here she comes.
You took your sweet time.

116
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:33,276
Well, you know...

117
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,671
You have it in, do you?

118
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,384
May I?

119
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:57,800
I can't anymore.

120
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:00,402
I'm so hot and jumpy inside.

121
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:05,831
No.

122
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:10,642
Looks like you're ready.

123
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:22,124
Okay, spread your legs.

124
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,854
No. I'm so embarrassed.

125
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,958
Come on, Priol.

126
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:34,067
Come on, spread them right.

127
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:39,475
Please, get it over with quickly.

128
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:41,940
Could you give me some more?

129
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,443
It's easy for you to say.

130
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:48,777
This is a problem. Let me help you.

131
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:55,453
No, no!

132
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:00,523
No more. No.

133
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:03,191
Here it is.

134
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:16,477
This will be more than enough.

135
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,274
Aren't we done yet?

136
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:21,345
Quick, pull this out of me.

137
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:23,545
Are you sure?

138
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:27,651
You're sucking it in down here,
like you're enjoying it.

139
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,186
No! That sends vibration deep inside.

140
00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:36,332
But your lips down here say they like it.

141
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,491
No, that's not true.

142
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:43,801
Or maybe you're a slut who gets drenched,
even when she doesn't want it.

143
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:45,708
You must be.

144
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:47,173
I know you're doing this
for the medicine, but...

145
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:50,680
it's your first time and you're
sucking this in like this.

146
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:54,406
But that's because you told me to put it in.

147
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:56,586
But you are so wet.

148
00:14:56,787 --> 00:15:00,587
You have the vibrator as a plug,
yet you're flowing and flooding.

149
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:02,653
That's a lie.

150
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,918
Please, don't be mean.
Please pull it out quickly.

151
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:08,828
All right.

152
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:19,599
See, it tastes like Priol.

153
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:21,711
No, don't do that.

154
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:26,681
You didn't want me to pull it out?

155
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,885
I did want you to.

156
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:32,148
Be honest.

157
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,020
Then, I'll make you feel even better.

158
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:44,864
I can't. I feel like crying. What should I do?

159
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:47,132
What do you want me to do?

160
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,569
I don't know. I don't.

161
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,769
I'm just so hot down there. Please!

162
00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:55,334
I got it.

163
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,039
Come on, over there.

164
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,719
Like this?

165
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,605
You're so wet, you've got nothing
to worry about.

166
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:30,773
Okay, relax.

167
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:43,415
Are you okay?

168
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:45,825
Yes.

169
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:06,309
Does it feel better now?

170
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,080
I don't know, but...

171
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:12,744
it feels weird down there.

172
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:24,458
Hey, if you make so much noise,
Mia might hear you.

173
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:27,693
No! I don't want her to!

174
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:39,874
It would be a problem if Mia saw you now.

175
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,210
While Mia is sick in bed...

176
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,048
you're doing this slutty thing.

177
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:48,052
No. Please don't say that.

178
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:49,989
That's not true.

179
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,962
But you're squeezing me
down here so tightly.

180
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:56,961
You're wrong.

181
00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:00,467
I can't anymore.

182
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:03,435
I can't, either.

183
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:17,314
It's so good.

184
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:25,059
It's so good. I'm coming.

185
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:08,098
Hey.

186
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,630
What?

187
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:17,042
Weren't you going to use
that to mix the Elixir?

188
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:19,477
What? Who said that?

189
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:24,143
But, you said you needed
a virgin's lust juice.

190
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:27,012
I just wanted to drink it.

191
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:31,658
Then what about the Elixir?

192
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:40,002
As I promised, here's the Elixir.

193
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:46,069
Could it be that you've always had it there?

194
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:01,752
Where is Sakra?

195
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,854
What, Sakra's already back?

196
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:07,957
Yes, quite a while ago.

197
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:33,420
Sakra.

198
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:41,155
Sakra. May I come in?

199
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:49,838
Sakra, what's wrong?

200
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:04,319
Hyde, if you just tell me it's all right...

201
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:08,823
then I'll be all right. Because I trust you.

202
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,759
I'm just being selfish.

203
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:20,464
I don't want you to do anything dangerous,
because I'm selfish.

204
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,906
I'm sorry. I promised myself I'd never,
ever say it.

205
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:26,735
But you never said that before...

206
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:29,810
Is it because you saw Teres?

207
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,649
Because, if I said it, you'd worry,
wouldn't you?

208
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:42,224
Then, you'd worry about me, and
you won't be able to do what you want.

209
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:44,360
Sakra, you mean...

210
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:48,529
I didn't want that.
I didn't want to be your burden.

211
00:21:48,998 --> 00:21:51,967
So, I decided to just watch you.

212
00:21:53,203 --> 00:21:55,398
I decided I'd never be weak.

213
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,573
But, why haven't you told me?

214
00:21:57,807 --> 00:21:59,331
Can't you trust me?

215
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,577
No! It's not that!

216
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:06,111
I've been selfish enough
to follow you around.

217
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:09,509
I didn't want to act more selfish
and trouble you.

218
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:13,921
I can't be a burden to your dreams anymore.

219
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:18,961
But I had to say it.
I was kind of scared today.

220
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:21,824
When I started thinking,
what if you didn't come back?

221
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:23,263
Silly.

222
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:27,127
I'm sorry.

223
00:22:28,004 --> 00:22:30,802
Silly. You have to say these things.

224
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:34,335
I'm, you know, insensitive.

225
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:38,278
I know. That's why I never told you.

226
00:22:38,414 --> 00:22:39,574
You.

227
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:42,217
You've always been telling me never
to hide anything from you...

228
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:44,843
but you never told me anything, either.

229
00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:47,785
Because I was shy.

230
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:50,554
What's there to be shy about?

231
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:56,056
I do, how can I put it, worry.

232
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,759
Well, I had you worry about me.

233
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,167
I'm sorry.

234
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:04,864
It's all right.
Hyde, you're kind of kind today.

235
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:08,136
Silly. I'm always kind.

236
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:11,477
Hey.

237
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,941
Could we stay like this a little longer?

238
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:16,682
Yeah.

239
00:23:16,986 --> 00:23:19,386
- I'm glad.
- Why?

240
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:22,690
I think you do care about me.

241
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:24,516
Of course.

242
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:26,989
Yeah.

243
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,133
Hey, Hyde.

244
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:34,893
What is it?

245
00:23:35,238 --> 00:23:38,230
I've always loved you, Hyde.

246
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:40,202
I know that.

247
00:23:41,077 --> 00:23:42,772
What about you, Hyde?

248
00:23:43,313 --> 00:23:44,541
Me?

249
00:23:46,616 --> 00:23:50,814
You're more precious
to me than anyone else.

250
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:54,746
Hyde!

251
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:56,990
Hyde!

252
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,256
I love you, I love you!

253
00:24:02,298 --> 00:24:04,528
Hyde!

254
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,485
Sakra.

255
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:32,258
It's okay, Hyde.

256
00:24:32,362 --> 00:24:33,624
Sakra.

257
00:24:33,696 --> 00:24:35,129
It's okay, because it's you.

258
00:24:35,198 --> 00:24:37,462
It's not okay if it's not you.

259
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:41,970
I want to feel you forever and ever, so I...

260
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:45,532
I want to be one with you, too, Sakra.

261
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:46,700
Hyde...

262
00:24:46,843 --> 00:24:50,370
I've always wanted to feel closer to you.

263
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:51,808
Really?

264
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:56,284
Yeah. Because I love you.
Because I love you more than anyone else.

265
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:58,553
Hyde.

266
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:05,691
I'm happy, but I'm crying. This is so funny.

267
00:25:06,095 --> 00:25:08,029
Sakra.

268
00:25:24,747 --> 00:25:27,545
I'm so shy. So shy.

269
00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:30,050
There's nothing to be shy about.

270
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,417
You have such cute breasts.

271
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:34,488
Really?

272
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:36,990
Yes, so soft here.

273
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,460
You're so cute, Sakra,
when you're being shy.

274
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:43,226
I'm so happy.
You're telling me I'm cute.

275
00:25:58,114 --> 00:26:01,208
If you touch me like that, I'll go crazy.

276
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:03,008
It's okay.

277
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,121
No, Hyde.

278
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:20,493
Not so hard!

279
00:26:20,603 --> 00:26:22,070
No.

280
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,833
Sakra, your boobs are sweet and delicious.

281
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,505
Don't talk like that.

282
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:29,267
Sakra.

283
00:26:30,446 --> 00:26:33,506
Hyde, don't touch my breasts like that.

284
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:42,815
No, no. Hyde, no.

285
00:26:55,538 --> 00:26:58,939
Sakra, you have a very beautiful body.

286
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,737
I'm so shy, Hyde.

287
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:05,174
Sakra.

288
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:32,534
Right there.

289
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:40,382
No. I'm so shy.

290
00:27:40,716 --> 00:27:43,150
Sakra, show me more.

291
00:27:44,187 --> 00:27:45,916
Yeah.

292
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:49,855
No. Not there. I'm shy.

293
00:27:50,193 --> 00:27:53,390
Sakra, I can smell you down here. So cute.

294
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,267
No, Hyde. It feels so good.

295
00:28:00,636 --> 00:28:04,595
Sakra, I want to come inside you. Can I?

296
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:09,438
Yes, please. Come, Hyde, please.
Come inside me.

297
00:28:15,852 --> 00:28:17,342
Hyde...

298
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:22,214
Sakra, does it hurt?

299
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,359
I'm okay. Because it's you, Hyde.

300
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,658
It's all right. Come inside me.

301
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:36,527
Sakra, I'm all the way inside you.

302
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:41,000
Sakra, bear with me a little.
I want to feel you.

303
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,201
I can't hold back anymore. So...

304
00:28:45,148 --> 00:28:49,107
It's all right. Hyde, do whatever you want.
I'm all yours.

305
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:52,844
I want to feel you, too. It's all right,
even if it hurts.

306
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:54,979
Sakra.

307
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:16,434
Sakra.

308
00:29:16,812 --> 00:29:19,007
It's okay, come on, Hyde.

309
00:29:19,515 --> 00:29:21,915
I want to feel you more.

310
00:29:22,185 --> 00:29:23,675
Sakra.

311
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:53,478
Hyde, it's weird. I'm so hot.

312
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:55,744
I can't control myself.

313
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,050
Sakra.

314
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:01,985
I'm so hot down there.
I'm so hot where I'm connected to you.

315
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:03,988
Hyde.

316
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:13,066
Sakra, Sakra.

317
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:17,896
Hyde, you cock is so deep,
it's hitting me deep inside!

318
00:30:19,508 --> 00:30:22,068
Love you, I love you, Hyde.

319
00:30:22,378 --> 00:30:24,005
I love you!

320
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:29,881
No. Something's happening.

321
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:36,189
Sakra, I can't hold back anymore.

322
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:39,486
Sakra, Sakra.

323
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,988
Hyde, come for me, Hyde!

324
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:46,699
Sakra!

325
00:31:05,454 --> 00:31:08,218
I'm so happy now.

326
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:12,627
Finally I've become one with you, Hyde.

327
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:15,453
And you love me, too, Hyde.
