1
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,427
Mommy, tell me that story again?

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,440
The story about the royal ball?

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,099
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,803
You really like that story?

5
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:12,936
Yeah.

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:18,177
That's where you and
daddy first met, right?

7
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,584
I wanna go to the
castle when I get bigger.

8
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,422
Rachel, you want
to be a princess?

9
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:30,862
No! I wanna go to the royal ball
and meet a man like daddy.

10
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:35,264
Mom... can I go to the royal ball?

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,095
Rachel, honey...

12
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,572
You're going to be
a beautiful woman.

13
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:45,702
But I don't think you should
go to the royal ball.

14
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,144
Why not...?

15
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,985
Someone might step on you
with their pointy high heels.

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,024
Did someone step on you?

17
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:06,398
I was the one who stepped on somebody.
I stepped on your father quite a few times.

18
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,469
Was daddy mad?

19
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:09,769
No.
Was daddy mad?

20
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,360
No.

21
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,164
I wasn't really well educated
and I couldn't dance but...

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,540
...I put on a pretty dress
and went to the ball anyway.

23
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,241
I just wanted to run
far away from there.

24
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:27,946
But your father helped
me through to the end.

25
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,060
His feet were so swollen though.

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,288
Daddy's so wonderful!

27
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:36,929
Yes, he is.

28
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:43,030
I wanna get married with
someone just like daddy.

29
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,062
Oh, no! I feel sorry for your groom!

30
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:10,828
Rachel, look! You're already
ready for a bigger size.

31
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:19,332
Look how big this one is.
The Bishop will be pleased.

32
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,507
Rachel, come with us.

33
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,744
No! I want to go home
with my mommy.

34
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,319
Your home is with us now.

35
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,686
No!

36
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,487
Mother! Mother!

37
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,686
Your mother has passed away!

38
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,698
Your mother is gone now.

39
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:51,295
No! Mother! Mother!

40
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:39,451
At first we could barely
even fit a finger in you.

41
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,649
But look at you now. You love
taking big ones like this, don't you.

42
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,851
You're a little slut now, Rachel.

43
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:50,020
Look how wet you get.

44
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,166
You're going to really enjoy this.

45
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,897
And it's too bad you'll never
be able to escape from here.

46
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,342
But we're finding your
education quite rewarding!

47
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:20,452
Love Doll Episode 1

48
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:36,875
We're gonna be late.

49
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:41,707
Rachel!

50
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,885
Rachel, what are you doing?
Hurry up, you'll be late.

51
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,254
Beth!

52
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,580
Already? But I have to
bring this to the altar.

53
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,387
I'll take it for you.
You get to class, okay?

54
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,055
Are you sure?

55
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,162
Yeah, don't worry. That's
what roommates are for.

56
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,201
Beth...

57
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:23,722
Sister Eva, how's
Rachel's education coming?

58
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,125
She's still just beginning.

59
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:34,931
I'm sure she'll be turning
men's heads someday.

60
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,094
Well, now I'm getting jealous.

61
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,771
Eva...

62
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,979
You are so amazing.

63
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,376
Be sure to educate her
in all your techniques.

64
00:05:56,622 --> 00:06:02,151
"...and people began gathering
upon hearing the noise. Then
the apostles began to speak..."

65
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:07,189
"...using the language of the villagers. The
people looked on silently, as if in shock."

66
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:15,503
"They became suspicious and asked
'They are all Gallarian, aren't they?"

67
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:23,843
"However, they speak to us in our own
language. How do you explain this?"'

68
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,547
"One among us is a Paltenian and..."

69
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:33,551
Mother! Mother?
Where are you?

70
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,616
Rachel!
Rachel!

71
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,718
Rachel, look up.

72
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,784
Rachel, stand up!

73
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,889
Yes.

74
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,296
We're still in class here. If
you have something on your
mind, think about it later.

75
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,195
You were thinking
about men, weren't you?

76
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,140
N... no!

77
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:03,044
I think I'm partly
to blame, ma'am.

78
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,606
What do you mean, Marsha?

79
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:11,920
She was affected by
my perfect reading.

80
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,661
She probably heard the words
I was reading from the Bible...

81
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,032
...and thought that God
was speaking to her.

82
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,832
She's right. I'm moved by her reading.

83
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,803
You're right. It's so lovely.

84
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,066
I guess I have no choice.

85
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:33,908
Rachel, I will forgive you
this time, thanks to Marsha.

86
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,345
You can sit down now.

87
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,080
Yes.

88
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,851
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to startle you.

89
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:25,761
I was walking in the woods
and I heard you singing...

90
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,828
No, I...

91
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:38,966
Are you alright?

92
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,875
Did you hurt yourself?

93
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,514
Ah... No. Thank you so much.

94
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,423
I'm sorry for coming
up from behind you.

95
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,922
You're bleeding.

96
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,827
Oh, it's nothing.

97
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,911
Th... thank you.

98
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,484
Can we meet again
here tomorrow?

99
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,253
I have to wash this and
give it back to you.

100
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,253
OK.

101
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,427
And I'd like to know your name.

102
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:42,133
Oh, I'm sorry.
I... I'm Rachel.

103
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,574
I'm Andrew.

104
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,271
You live in the convent, right?

105
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,372
I live near here.

106
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,552
Maybe we can keep meeting?

107
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,185
I'm sorry. I forgot...

108
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,349
...you're not supposed
to talk to strangers.

109
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,323
...right?

110
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,553
Ah... No.

111
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,562
I'm sure we can
see each other again.

112
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,298
Really?!

113
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,697
That's great.

114
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:13,071
I don't often get a chance to
meet girls who fall from trees.

115
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,630
Oh, Andrew, you're terrible.

116
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,039
I'm sorry.

117
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:21,170
So, I'll wait for you here
tomorrow at this time.

118
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:25,775
Okay. And I'll come down
from the tree again.

119
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,613
I'll bring a big cushion and
wait for you, Princess.

120
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,514
No.

121
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:49,137
Oh, here you are, Rachel.
I need to talk to you.

122
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,506
Do you have a few minutes?

123
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,909
Don't worry. It won't take too long.

124
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,251
As long as you
promise to behave!

125
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,517
No!

126
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,716
No!

127
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,362
Please stop!

128
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,960
Why do always treat
me like an enemy?

129
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,438
Phew! What a revolting smell!

130
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,973
You have the same smell.

131
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,376
The smell of a whore!

132
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:32,310
Did you meet Andrew
in the woods today?

133
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,687
Trying to seduce Andrew
with your foul pussy?

134
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,561
Don't you think that's
being rude to him?

135
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:51,937
An elegant woman like me
would be perfect for Andrew.

136
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:52,902
Do you understand?

137
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:59,507
I am going to marry Andrew
and be Princess of this land.

138
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,740
The Prince with a whore?!
I don't think so!

139
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,544
<i>Andrew is the Prince of the Castle?!</i>

140
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,950
You should remember
what your lot in life is.

141
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:15,289
It would be so easy for
me to get rid of you.

142
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,722
Have you forgotten that the
only reason you're here...

143
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,299
...is because of the mercy of the church?

144
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,700
Is this big enough for you?

145
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,299
<i>Andrew is</i>... <i>the Prince?!</i>

146
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,252
Look at her. She came with a vase.

147
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,121
I can't believe her.

148
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:57,936
<i>Andrew</i>...

149
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,331
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know
anyone was down there.

150
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,408
Rachel!

151
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,907
How horrible!

152
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,844
Thank you, Beth.

153
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:50,820
I'm fine.

154
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,584
Rachel...

155
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:11,266
Rachel, it's time for your lesson.

156
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,140
Come up here.

157
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,205
Yes.

158
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,717
Now turn around, get on your
knees and show me your ass.

159
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:28,851
Yes.

160
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,400
We haven't even begun yet
and you're already wet.

161
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,469
You can take it really deep, can't you?

162
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,171
But you have yet to open
your mind and enjoy all this.

163
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,442
Don't you like these nightly lessons?

164
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,720
Once you open your mind,
you'll enjoy your night life more.

165
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,485
You never know when
all this is going to end.

166
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,192
It would be much easier if you just
learned to accept this and enjoy it.

167
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,965
Here's a little something to
help build your courage.

168
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,768
It will also allow you to free
your mind of any inhibitions.

169
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,202
No!

170
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,107
No! I can't stop.

171
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,782
It's alright. There's nothing
to be ashamed about.

172
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,412
How does it feel? It feels good
peeing freely in the open, no?

173
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:37,192
Here. What do you want next? You want
this? You're dying for some cock, right?

174
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:41,096
You want to reach out and
grab it, don't you, Rachel?

175
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,535
Your dick...

176
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,931
Oh, Rachel! Good, isn't it?

177
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,636
You like the taste?

178
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,043
Take your time and enjoy it.

179
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,651
I love your cock!

180
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,325
Good.

181
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,361
I'm going to come, Rachel.

182
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,659
Come on me.

183
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,868
Blow a big load...

184
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:39,183
More! I want more cock.
Stick it in me.

185
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,753
You really are a slut.
Just as I expected.

186
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,665
Back then, it was easy to lie and
tell you it was all your imagination...

187
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,364
But until today, you've
suppressed the excitement.

188
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,340
...you felt that day you
saw sex for the first time.

189
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,042
That day... when you
first saw intercourse...

190
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,276
...bare flesh on flesh...

191
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,314
You'd never heard a women's
voice scream in erotic bliss...

192
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:20,298
You've been waiting for this day with
fear but also secret anticipation...

193
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,526
...waiting to enjoy this
pleasure with all your heart.

194
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,119
Marsha!

195
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,047
Where have you been
at this time of night?

196
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,721
Is it true you were with the Bishop?

197
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:58,066
I don't care what you're
doing with old men but...

198
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:04,366
...I don't want a slut like you to go
anywhere near my Andrew ever again.

199
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:27,858
Rachel?

200
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,469
Rachel!

201
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,167
What happened to you,
Rachel?! Rachel?

202
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,602
Your hair...

203
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,616
Good morning, Beth.

204
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,516
Is something wrong?

205
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,918
Wrong?! Your hair...

206
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,787
Ah... this...?

207
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,628
It's nothing really...

208
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,497
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Rachel.

209
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,502
Beth?

210
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

211
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:12,876
Beth... what are you sorry for?

212
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:19,248
I... I knew about all this, Rachel.
I knew you were in trouble.

213
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:24,118
But I was so scared... I couldn't
do anything to help you.

214
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,627
Don't cry, Beth.

215
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,330
Thank you.

216
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,661
Rachel!

217
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,820
You have such big breasts, Beth!

218
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,191
No... I'm embarrassed.

219
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,397
Beth... You're wet.

220
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,096
Ah... Don't tease me!

221
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,532
See? I can put my finger in you.

222
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,807
Ouch! Rachel, it hurts.

223
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:27,341
Don't worry. I'll go slow.

224
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,820
Look how far in you I can go.

225
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,598
Ah... ah... It's in!

226
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:48,632
Beth, I know it feels good. You're
wet. And look how swollen your clit is!

227
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,133
Beth... do it to me now!

228
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:53,301
But...

229
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,138
Let's come together, Beth.

230
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,145
Rachel...

231
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,548
Rachel, you're so loose.

232
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,427
Ah... Beth, it feels so good!

233
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,583
So, what do you think, Rachel?

234
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,694
Wow! It looks great, Beth!

235
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,064
You think so?

236
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,031
Really! It looks much better than before!

237
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,602
Thank you, Rachel!

238
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,207
For forgiving me.

239
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,905
No, Beth. You don't have to say that.

240
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,642
Because... I... I...

241
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,513
You cry so easily, Beth.

242
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,816
Because... because...

243
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:20,889
I'm lucky to have a friend
like you to cry for me.

244
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:21,660
Really?

245
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,392
Yes.

246
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:27,504
<i>Thank you, Beth. I'm going to</i>
<i>be more careful from now on</i>.

247
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,303
<i>I don't want you to worry</i>
<i>about me anymore</i>.

248
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:38,779
Your always such a
sweet fuck, Rachel!

249
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,380
This soft and supple skin...

250
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:47,086
Ah... these sweet lips...

251
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:53,928
You'll be a woman who
can win any king's heart.

252
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,058
I'll make sure of that.

253
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:02,272
Rachel... today I want
you to use your hands...

254
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:10,805
Use your hands to make me come...

255
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,517
Come... come a lot...

256
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,381
Come all over me!

257
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,415
Good morning.

258
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:55,026
Hey, you got your hair cut.

259
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,324
I almost didn't recognize you.

260
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:01,456
Andrew, I... I...

261
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,572
I'm sorry. I didn't
bring a good cushion.

262
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,506
I'm glad I caught you
before you climbed up.

263
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,776
You won't need to use
this scarf again today.

264
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,242
Andrew... I'm sorry. I...

265
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:21,513
Rachel, I didn't come
to see a sad face today.

266
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,457
I came to see your sweet smile.

267
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,926
Oh, yeah! Can you come with me?

268
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,857
Andrew!

269
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,262
Rachel, hold the basket.

270
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,207
These look good.

271
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,046
Try one.

272
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,424
Delicious!

273
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,808
So, the princess approves
of the grapes I grew myself?

274
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:25,210
Wow! You grew these grapes!?
I didn't know that princes...

275
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,321
You know? I... I...

276
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,256
Please, just call me Andrew.

277
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,116
Is that okay with you?

278
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,127
Yes.

279
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,399
Rachel, this is for you.

280
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,404
Really? But...

281
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,536
Take it.

282
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:31,007
I... I can't...

283
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,940
It looks good on you.

284
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,489
It's Rachel. You asked for me?

285
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,288
Come in.

286
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:26,098
Rachel, this gentleman has
brought very good news for you.

287
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,005
For me?

288
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,634
Yes.

289
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,940
You must be Lady Rachel. I
have come to take you with me.

290
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,244
What?

291
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,135
Rachel?

292
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,639
You are... Andrew, right?

293
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:14,281
You must be Beth, Rachel's friend.
I've heard a lot about you.

294
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,013
Andrew...

295
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,248
Rachel is...

296
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,398
Goodbye, Andrew.

297
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,394
This is from Rachel.

298
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:37,539
Huh? Wait!

299
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:54,222
<i>Andrew</i>... <i>It's so hard to say</i>
<i>good-bye to you like this</i>.

300
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,123
Rachel...

301
00:29:56,227 --> 00:30:01,529
<i>When you read this letter,</i>
<i>I will already be on a train</i>.

302
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:09,639
<i>I'm going to live with my uncle, Duke</i>
<i>Dusse, my dead mother's brother</i>.

303
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:18,441
<i>I'll never forget the day we first met and</i>
<i>the times we spent in the grape fields</i>.

304
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:25,018
<i>It is so painful for me to leave you</i>.

305
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:34,829
<i>Don't worry, Andrew. I've heard that</i>
<i>everyone in his castle is very nice</i>.

306
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:41,332
<i>I hope to surprise you by being a</i>
<i>lovely lady the next time we meet</i>.

307
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,899
<i>Andrew</i>... <i>can you wait for</i>
<i>me until that day comes?</i>

308
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,711
Rachel?

309
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,404
Y... Yes.

310
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:53,246
This was made specially for you, Rachel.

311
00:30:53,718 --> 00:31:00,123
It will be a long trip and
this will help you relax.

312
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:06,789
Duke Dusse wants you to become the
fairest of maidens as quickly as possible.

313
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,903
He asked that I begin your lessons
on becoming royalty immediately.

314
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,497
Is this okay with you, Rachel?

315
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:16,599
Yes.

316
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:22,340
Good. Why don't we begin by helping
you change into these clothes
we've prepared for you.

317
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:30,150
No! What are you doing?! STOP!

318
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,823
Here.

319
00:31:56,514 --> 00:32:02,350
You will follow the program the
master has arranged for you.

320
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:08,655
These lessons were created to help
prepare you for your royal debut.

321
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:13,364
They will help you become the flower
of the royal circles... the Love Doll.

322
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,855
Love... Doll??!

323
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,233
Well... please start with your own finger.

324
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:26,071
<i>It can't be!</i>
<i>These terrible things will continue?</i>

325
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,952
Forget everything you knew before.

326
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,288
The good memories and the bad...

327
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,259
Leave all that behind you now...

328
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,276
<i>Andrew!</i>

329
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:18,584
You will forget everything and
give your life to Duke Dusse.

330
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,038
<i>Andrew!</i>

331
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,213
Excuse me.

332
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:50,026
Master, I brought you a drink.

333
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:56,795
Is something wrong, Master?
You look rather happy.

334
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,268
Is it that obvious, Carol?

335
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:04,408
I never knew I had such
a sweet, young niece.

336
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,007
Yes, she's really cute!

337
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,949
I want you to help
out with her, Carol.

338
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,717
Oh, I will be more than
happy to help, Master.

339
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:44,938
This is just the beginning,
Rachel. It all starts now.
