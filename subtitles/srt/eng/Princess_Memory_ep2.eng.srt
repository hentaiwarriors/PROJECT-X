1
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:10,353
Felina.

2
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:17,491
This is...

3
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:19,525
What a beautiful flower.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,531
Felina, you can talk?

5
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:30,138
Save me, please. Save me.

6
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,682
Princess Memory: Second Half

7
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:05,335
Collin!

8
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:10,149
Felina.

9
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:15,414
Felina, you've got your soul back?

10
00:01:16,757 --> 00:01:18,122
Felina.

11
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:26,631
Sly Felina!

12
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:39,004
Stop it! Please stop it!

13
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:47,817
A dream?

14
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:58,531
Felina, what am I supposed to do? Tell me.

15
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,759
This is...

16
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,801
What am I supposed to do with it?

17
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:13,704
Save me. Save me, please.

18
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:34,829
Lily.

19
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:39,499
So, you're going back?

20
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:45,506
I can't stop at this point.

21
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:48,346
For the sake of Sallian and Lily.

22
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:54,250
It's a charm for your safety.

23
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:58,180
Pony, I'll look after Felina,
so don't worry about her.

24
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:02,223
Yes, thank you.

25
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:11,626
Collin...

26
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:29,283
All right! Fight me!

27
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:33,518
What?

28
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,452
It's just a Nuvolian.

29
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:38,230
You've got a lot of gusto, don't you?

30
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,492
There's something I've got to complete.

31
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,529
What's that?

32
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:51,541
It's what Felina gave me.

33
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:54,680
Is that so?

34
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:05,485
There's a secret in that amulet.

35
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,359
Madonna Felina.

36
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:11,955
Felina can be restored
to her original self.

37
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:17,160
Only when all the characters of Felina
are sealed inside the amulet.

38
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:21,540
What a troublemaker you are.

39
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,531
Sly Felina!

40
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:26,945
Didn't you have enough already?

41
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:29,538
Besides, can you die for Felina?

42
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:30,911
Of course I can.

43
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:44,588
Without this amulet,
Felina's soul cannot be captured.

44
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:45,653
Understand?

45
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,333
- Stop that!
- Take that!

46
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:56,540
Just give up.

47
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,877
You won't be able to save Felina.

48
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:00,944
I will!

49
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:12,582
Collin, I can make it faster.

50
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:24,501
Have a good time in hell, won't you?

51
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,289
I can't believe this.

52
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,367
What? Don't!

53
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,171
You are...

54
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:05,808
Sallian!

55
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:08,310
Collin? Is it you, Collin?

56
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:16,377
Collin.

57
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:19,049
I was so scared down there.

58
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,750
The thought of dying alone
here drove me mad.

59
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:33,505
It's not safe here.

60
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:36,268
Monsters pop up all the time.

61
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:42,979
It's incredible.

62
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,683
Don't know why, but it's warm in here.

63
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:50,219
It's beautiful.

64
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:52,923
You're embarrassing me. Don't look.

65
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,488
It's not what I meant.

66
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,761
Pony, is she all right?

67
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,326
Yeah, she's doing fine.

68
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:04,229
Good. So long as she's okay.

69
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:05,727
Don't say that!

70
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,802
Sallian, you'll go back with me.

71
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,532
How are we going to get out
from the bottom of the world...

72
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,076
and find our way back?

73
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:18,116
It's okay. I don't mind dying here.

74
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:21,277
I'm not alone anymore.
Because, Collin, you're with me.

75
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:32,164
Please sleep with me.

76
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,864
Collin, I've been in love
with you for a long time.

77
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,367
Sallian, we shouldn't.

78
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:41,236
It's okay. It's just for this moment.

79
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:56,649
Don't look at me so closely.

80
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:58,915
You're are so beautiful.

81
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:07,891
Ready?

82
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:15,717
Just like in here,
it snows all day long...

83
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,625
quietly, outside this cave.

84
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,528
What a lonely place.

85
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:23,466
Snow never stops.

86
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:26,030
It's as if someone's crying.

87
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:42,110
I must go.

88
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:57,764
What was that?

89
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:01,229
Collin, let's play!

90
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:07,878
Come down here and fight me!

91
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:10,244
How many Felinas are there?

92
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,548
Sallian, just go ahead without me.

93
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,083
- Go on!
- Collin!

94
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:24,527
Sallian, just go ahead!

95
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:27,061
You've got no time to look away.

96
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,292
Go, quickly!

97
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,946
Please get inside the amulet quietly.

98
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,380
All right. I've lost.

99
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,511
But you'd better not think it's over.

100
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:03,726
Catch me if you can!

101
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,894
Wait!

102
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:10,472
Hey! Wait up!

103
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,410
Hurry! Catch me.

104
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,041
Now I've finally caught you!

105
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:45,908
I am Slut Felina.

106
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,739
Now, let's have fun.

107
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:52,473
- No, we can't.
- Why not?

108
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:55,749
I beg you.
Please get inside the amulet.

109
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:57,685
Why don't you forget that?

110
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:01,316
Besides, it'll feel really good. Here.

111
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:05,724
I'm begging you.

112
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:13,431
I see. You do really love her.

113
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:29,917
I want to go. I want to go home.

114
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:33,191
Collin, will you take me with you too?

115
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:35,954
Of course.

116
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,655
Thank you very much, Collin.

117
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:00,549
I'm almost there. But, I can't!

118
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:10,758
Pull! Pull with all your might!

119
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:12,052
Pull!

120
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:16,764
You, girl, from the village.

121
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:18,269
Where's Collin?

122
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:22,341
He's collecting the soul of Felina right now.

123
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,100
Is that right?

124
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,134
All right, then.

125
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:29,045
Collin will be able to do that now, I'm sure.

126
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:31,881
You've done well.

127
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:35,077
The last one remaining is Sly Felina.

128
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:37,952
You know her. I count on you.

129
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,568
Madonna Felina.

130
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:01,612
I'm not so easy like them.

131
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,098
Felina!

132
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:29,103
Don't call me Felina.

133
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,904
Yes, I will, for you are Felina.

134
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,876
I don't trust you. I trust no one.

135
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:38,706
This is the world that exists
in the center of your heart, isn't it?

136
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:41,183
A cold, frozen world.

137
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,411
Shut up and speak no more.

138
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:46,855
This world has turned Felina
into what she is today.

139
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:50,053
I told you to shut up. If you don't...

140
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,667
If I die, Felina will be gone forever.

141
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,761
Can't you get that through
your thick skull?

142
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:16,321
Look, Felina's suffering, as you can tell.

143
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:19,184
Can you feel her pain? Can you?

144
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:23,192
Stop it, Felina! Don't do that!

145
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,690
Felina's in pain. Now, try saving her.

146
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:35,201
That's right. You can't save her.
No one can.

147
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:37,706
Do you understand what I mean?

148
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,791
Felina, stop it. Please don't
hurt yourself any more.

149
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:07,400
The ice is melting. It can't be!

150
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,943
Felina, trust me. I've come here...

151
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:14,438
to save you.

152
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:16,570
Collin.

153
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:25,953
I've lost.

154
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,362
It's all over.

155
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:44,199
It looks like you've collected them all.

156
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:45,332
Collin!

157
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,317
I'm glad, Collin.

158
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:58,255
Thanks a lot for your help, Sallian.

159
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,125
There's a cliff over there.

160
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:13,728
If you jump off of it,
you can get back to your world.

161
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:17,874
This world and yours exist,
directly opposite each other.

162
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:24,443
Thanks everyone!

163
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:05,957
Sallian! Collin! I'm so glad!

164
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:07,958
Like I expected, you're back unscathed.

165
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:10,723
I was so sure you'd be back,
I prepared dinner for you.

166
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:15,390
I'm so glad. Really glad.
It's all thanks to you, Collin.

167
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:18,799
Collin, thank you so much.
Really, I mean it.

168
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:27,076
Felina, I'm on my way back to you.

169
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:38,455
Felina, I've finally returned home.

170
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:21,991
Dear, Collin.

171
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,364
Thank you, dear Collin.

172
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,595
You've risked your life to save me...

173
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:30,472
the Savage Felina, the Slut Felina
and even the Sly Felina.

174
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:34,238
How will I ever thank you?
How will I pay you back?

175
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:36,003
Felina.

176
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:40,717
My heart ached for so long,
I could never trust anyone.

177
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:42,310
Then you came.

178
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:47,187
I know. I noticed how
Sly Felina's eyes looked so sad.

179
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,827
My soul loves you.

180
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:52,760
They all love you, Collin. And I...

181
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:54,793
Iove you too, you know?

182
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:56,501
Felina.

183
00:20:57,603 --> 00:21:01,095
I was very scared. I couldn't trust anyone.

184
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:04,072
How about now?

185
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:07,968
I'm not scared anymore,
because I'm with you, Collin.

186
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,985
Collin, I love you. I want to be with you.

187
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:24,756
We'll be together forever.

188
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,097
I can't.

189
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:45,808
I just can't. No!

190
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:56,320
Not there.

191
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:03,234
I'm embarrassed.

192
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,530
Felina, you're so beautiful.

193
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:12,542
Don't look at me so closely.

194
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:13,973
May I?

195
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:29,651
Does it hurt?

196
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:35,299
No. I can feel you
with my whole body. I'm happy.

197
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:37,932
Felina...

198
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:52,646
Don't!

199
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:59,586
Collin, it's great!

200
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:19,477
Collin, thank you.

201
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:35,617
I want to be with you forever, Collin.

202
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:40,554
But the world you entered...

203
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,794
the world beyond the bottom
of this world, is my world.

204
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:47,267
If I don't return, that snow will not stop.

205
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:50,033
Although I will never be able
to see you again...

206
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:52,472
I won't forget the warmth you've given me.

207
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:56,103
I will remember you forever.
Thank you.

208
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:03,581
Felina.

209
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:17,967
Felina, the petals of the white flowers
are like the snow I saw in your world.
