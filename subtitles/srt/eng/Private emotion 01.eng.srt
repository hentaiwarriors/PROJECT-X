1
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,207
What are you reading?

2
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,917
Ms. Sayaka!

3
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,857
How long were you standing there?

4
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,552
Did I surprise you guys?

5
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,063
You know you did!

6
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,064
I'm embarrassed!

7
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,741
Let me take attendance.

8
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,909
Did you forget to bring
the attendance book?

9
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,477
Even Ms. Sayaka forgot something?

10
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:54,312
Don't worry. All of the
names are already in my head.

11
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,752
But you have been at this
college for only one week.

12
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,490
Amazing!

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,424
She is way smarter then you.

14
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:05,890
Come on, now!

15
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,123
Of course, she's our professor.

16
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,908
Chapter One: Lady
Teacher Sayaka and...

17
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,973
This is done.

18
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,608
Hey Makoto.

19
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,044
Makoto Yuuki!

20
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,718
Can you bring this to Ms. Sayaka?

21
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,154
Oh, okay.

22
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,930
I'm in a hurry to get to the club.

23
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,827
Have you decided which club to join?

24
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,200
No, not yet.

25
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:25,266
But it's been 3 months since
you transferred to this college.

26
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,838
What about the literature club?

27
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,717
Why?

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,356
I heard Ms. Sayaka is
the manager of the club.

29
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,818
You don't have to hide.

30
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:47,327
It seems like Ms. Sayaka is interested
too, you two make a great couple!

31
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,157
Stop teasing me.

32
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:54,939
You had better be hurry up. Otherwise,
the Bear will come and shout at you.

33
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,076
Who are you calling the Bear?

34
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,178
Shit! It's the bear.

35
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,883
Hey! Don't run in the hallway.

36
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,655
Ms. Sayaka likes me?

37
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,068
Teacher's Lounge

38
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,401
Ms. Nanjou, we've got a problem.

39
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,472
You should be more
strict with the students.

40
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,146
I don't think it's a good idea to
be too friendly to the students.

41
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,376
But the students need
more freedom on campus.

42
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:42,079
Balance is important in everything.

43
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,181
They still need discipline from us.

44
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:52,093
Otherwise they will think
they can control the teachers.

45
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:59,603
But we must also respect
their consciences.

46
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,601
Didn't you learn your lesson from
the trouble you made at your last college?

47
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:13,112
That's enough. She is
concerned for her students.

48
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,220
Do you think its okay to have
an affair with a student?

49
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,918
No, no way. What I'm trying to say is...

50
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,789
Excuse me.

51
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:50,029
Wake up, Shin.

52
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,030
Finish your breakfast or you
will be late for the class.

53
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,068
Where is Mom?

54
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:35,475
Your mother's visiting father.
She'll come back in two weeks.

55
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,081
She's just left.

56
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,446
She didn't tell me that.

57
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:47,081
On the phone, he told me that
the wife of his boss had a stroke.

58
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,255
I don't know exactly what happened.

59
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,635
So this is our first time
since you came to live here.

60
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,040
What do you mean?

61
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,642
We are alone in the
house for the first time.

62
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,124
That's right.

63
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,628
What are you doing, Shin?

64
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,501
Kisumi.

65
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:12,310
On campus, you had better
call me Ms. Takane.

66
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,508
Especially after
your affair with Sayaka.

67
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,877
You are right.

68
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,280
Are you thinking about Sayaka again?

69
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,180
Yeah.

70
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,491
Don't be silly.

71
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:36,192
Because she's concerned about you,
she decided to leave the college.

72
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,298
Don't waste her decision.

73
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,670
Yes, I know.

74
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:48,573
I appreciate your ef forts for us.

75
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,544
Never mind about me.

76
00:10:52,885 --> 00:11:00,690
If you still love her, you
should graduate from college.

77
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,318
That's the best thing
you can do for her.

78
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,725
Bye, Ms. Hasuda.

79
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,730
I'm going. See you, Yui.

80
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,566
Bye.

81
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:33,856
I used to be sick in bed
all the time, alone at home.

82
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:38,853
From my bedroom, I always
looked outside of the window.

83
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,701
Have you seen any changes after
my family moved next door to you?

84
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:48,870
Yes. You came and played
with me. You took me outside.

85
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,373
You didn't like it?

86
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,408
Oh yes, I liked it!

87
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:10,419
So what do you want to show me?

88
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,295
Um...

89
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:47,157
I love you, Shin.

90
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,900
I fell in love with you way
before Sayaka came into your life.

91
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,162
Yui...

92
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,839
Why do you still treat me
like your little sister?

93
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,172
Don't you find my body beautiful?

94
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,312
I mean, it's so beautiful.

95
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:08,544
Really?

96
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:23,194
Please, Shin, make love to me.

97
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:06,105
Oh yes. I've waited for this.
You make me feel so good.

98
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,015
I'm so happy...

99
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,080
It hurts.

100
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,636
Be tender.

101
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,538
Yeah, that's it.

102
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,921
I'm embarrassed...

103
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,954
That feels so good.

104
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,994
I'm coming! I'm coming!

105
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,040
I'm so hungry!

106
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:19,947
Me too!

107
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,331
Shall we go?

108
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,230
Yes.

109
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,899
You are a little late today.

110
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,434
Did you meet Yui?

111
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,072
A-Ah, yeah...

112
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,146
We bumped into each other.

113
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:32,515
I'm cooking your
favorite dish for dinner.

114
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,159
Wow, that's great.

115
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,427
Let me change clothes.

116
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,255
Okay.

117
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,337
Let it simmer for a while.

118
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,726
Is she masturbating?

119
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,646
What's the matter? Why
are you in the dark?

120
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,154
Are you taking a shower or...

121
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,155
I'm sorry. Are you in
the middle of changing?

122
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,093
No, that's okay.

123
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,534
Are you going to take a
shower first or have dinner?

124
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,468
Well, I will take a shower first.

125
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,936
Okay, let me bring you a bath towel.

126
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,779
What is going on, Shin?

127
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:51,085
I love you. I fell in love
with you a long time ago.

128
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,227
I always wanted to take a
shower together with you.

129
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:03,124
No, Shin, you shouldn't do this.

130
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,467
Tell me what you think of me.

131
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,679
Yes, I love you, too.

132
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,211
Are you sure?

133
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,721
Yes.

134
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,438
Please be gentle.

135
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,718
Shin...

136
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,424
No...

137
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:17,802
This is embarrassing, but I'm happy.

138
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,675
Let me touch yours.

139
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,679
It's so big...

140
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,552
It's hot, and hard.

141
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,868
Yeah, that's it.

142
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,895
Don't tease me.

143
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,405
No don't stop there.

144
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:26,907
I want your cock deep inside me now.

145
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,452
Does it hurt?

146
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,214
Are you okay?

147
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,751
Yeah, I'm okay.

148
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:45,260
Do you feel good, Shin?

149
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,323
Yeah, you feel wonderful, Ms. Sayaka.

150
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,392
Call me just Sayaka.

151
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,966
Sayaka, is it okay if I move?

152
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,663
Shin...

153
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,478
Shin, harder...

154
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,717
So great!

155
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,696
Shin, give it to me more.

156
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,131
Harder!

157
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,075
Harder!

158
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,537
So good

159
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,744
Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming!

160
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,120
Shin, I'm coming!

161
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:39,267
Give it to me harder!

162
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:44,174
I'm going crazy!

163
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,679
Oh Shin...

164
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,660
Shin, let's come together!

165
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,671
Shin, I can't hold it
anymore! I'm coming!

166
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,785
Please stop it.

167
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,202
Forgive me, Shin...
