1
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:43,488
Brother.

2
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,128
Brother, you and Yoshifuku are
having a relationship, aren't you?

3
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:57,501
Let's see.

4
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,913
How far has the relationship gone?

5
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:02,815
H-how far?

6
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:06,019
No, excuse me.
I asked the wrong question.

7
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:08,682
Yeah, what kinda question is...

8
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:09,745
Sorry!

9
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:15,260
I just wanted to ask
how you feel about her?

10
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:17,661
O-of course... I...

11
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:20,030
like her.

12
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,032
That's why
we're seeing each other!

13
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,504
Well... I have to study.

14
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,335
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

15
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:36,835
And...

16
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:38,903
See you next time.

17
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:43,165
Sure.

18
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,772
Bye.

19
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:56,380
Yoshifuku.

20
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,264
Ah... yes... this is leda's residence.

21
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:11,735
Hello.

22
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:13,967
- Junichi?
- Yoshifuku?

23
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:16,901
I...

24
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:20,813
What's the matter?
Your voice is trembling.

25
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:26,743
I-I did... with your sister.

26
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:29,388
I'm sorry.

27
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:32,189
My sister?

28
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:37,463
Miyuki!!

29
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:52,403
Hey, Miyuki.

30
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,178
Miyuki, wait a minute.

31
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,423
Did anything happened
at Yoshifuku's?

32
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:08,184
Get out of here.

33
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:10,587
I'm going to take a shower now.

34
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:49,026
I wasn't expecting you to come here.
Miyuki... that's your name?

35
00:07:04,185 --> 00:07:05,675
I'll get right to the point.

36
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:11,116
The man who you were just with.
Who is he?

37
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:20,797
Are you talking about
Satoshi Akiyama?

38
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:23,960
He is in same lecture
with me and leda.

39
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:27,565
We are all very close friends.

40
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:30,404
Close enough for kissing?

41
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:37,282
I saw you and him were kissing.

42
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:42,913
What did he come here for today?

43
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,220
What were you and he doing?

44
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:52,698
I hate such an attitude!

45
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:56,128
If you want to have relationship
with my brother...

46
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:57,500
please stop doing this.

47
00:07:57,571 --> 00:07:59,038
Satoshi is...

48
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:00,664
Break up with him!

49
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:14,886
I don't want a person like you
for my brother's girlfriend.

50
00:08:15,956 --> 00:08:20,120
But I have to accept it.

51
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:23,721
Because he likes you.

52
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:25,889
Miyuki...

53
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:31,531
Don't touch me!!

54
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:35,497
No... Miyuki...

55
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:36,969
Leave me alone.

56
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:39,804
It's not what you think!
I...

57
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:41,305
I hate you!

58
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:08,200
No!

59
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:20,151
Pervert!

60
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:22,945
Miyuki!

61
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:38,869
Pervert!

62
00:09:43,978 --> 00:09:45,104
Where is my brother?

63
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,146
He went out.
He said that a friend called him.

64
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:51,514
Why don't you
eat dinner fast, Miyuki?

65
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:52,574
Ah, yeah.

66
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:01,550
I'm sure he went to see her!
I'm not the one he cares about.

67
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:05,893
Stupid brother!!

68
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:20,175
Hi, can I get the "A" set?

69
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:21,612
Here we go!

70
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:25,542
What's the lunch special today?

71
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:29,349
- I'll give you a big portion today.
- Really? Lucky!

72
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,370
Sorry to make you wait.

73
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:50,942
Yoshifuku?

74
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:55,104
I'm sorry!

75
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:58,151
What's wrong?
Something's bothering you?

76
00:10:58,218 --> 00:11:00,186
Ah... I...

77
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:02,980
to tell you the truth...

78
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,488
I raped a woman.

79
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:14,090
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

80
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:18,266
I'm all right.
I'm just a little bit surprised.

81
00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:21,398
- That means you did it with...
- Leda's sister.

82
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,402
She seems to know
about our relationship...

83
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,280
I was told to choose
either you or leda...

84
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:37,812
so I didn't know what to do.

85
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,767
Does leda know about this?

86
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,467
I talked to him earlier.

87
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:52,997
And?

88
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:57,075
He was surprised too,
and he took it so seriously.

89
00:11:57,344 --> 00:12:02,805
He told me not to worry,
but I really hate myself.

90
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,816
I couldn't control
any part of myself.

91
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,714
Well...

92
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:39,247
What is she? Dirty and sick!

93
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:10,683
Did she suck my brother's...?

94
00:13:20,994 --> 00:13:21,983
Brother...

95
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:46,483
Brother.

96
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:57,524
I'm the same as her.
I'm dirty.

97
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:00,522
I'm like her...

98
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,098
Brother.

99
00:14:04,338 --> 00:14:05,669
Brother.

100
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:11,943
I like you, brother.

101
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:17,280
I also...

102
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:20,076
want your...

103
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:22,882
Miyuki!

104
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:25,886
Can I come in?

105
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:29,755
Ah, Sorry!

106
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:32,363
S-stupid! Idiot!

107
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:37,196
Brother, don't you know
how to knock?

108
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:38,966
I don't believe this.

109
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:42,475
S-sorry. I apologize.

110
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,642
Do you know about Yoshifuku?

111
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:30,218
I heard that she's always
fooling around with men!

112
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:32,416
Hey, what's that?

113
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:36,124
She supposed to be having a
relationship with three men now.

114
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:38,255
Who told you that?

115
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:42,834
Tell me! Who told you that?

116
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,630
- S-sorry.
- E-excuse us.

117
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,972
What's going on?
With Miyuki, and Yoshifuku...

118
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:52,705
I'm really confused.

119
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:07,357
Yoshifuku...

120
00:16:08,195 --> 00:16:11,255
Sometimes she's very cheerful
and sometimes serious.

121
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:15,427
At least I can help her
when she is upset.

122
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:17,126
Hey! Akiyama!

123
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:21,902
Is it true that you are
dating Yoshifuku?

124
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:26,479
W-well... we're just friends.

125
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:32,485
Well, then you're
dating with leda too?

126
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,778
I heard it was a rumor,
but we can tell it's true.

127
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,488
Akiyama is not a big deal for us,
but leda is very popular.

128
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:44,189
I agree. What's your
relationship with them?

129
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,822
Yeah, why don't you make it clear?

130
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:50,501
- Oh, god! Here we go.
- You have to tell us!

131
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,435
Yeah, tell us!

132
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:53,768
Stop it.

133
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:07,110
Well, what do you want to know?

134
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:09,982
W-we are just...

135
00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:14,219
We heard she is dating
both you and Akiyama.

136
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:18,560
- Yes, it's a rumor though.
- She is not dating either of us!

137
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:21,490
He is right.
We're just close friends.

138
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,927
But that's weird.

139
00:17:24,004 --> 00:17:26,097
Yeah, something is strange.

140
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:28,437
What kind of friendship
do you guys have?

141
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:30,032
We're...

142
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:32,907
Hey! Why don't you stop this?

143
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,846
I'm sure everybody has
some kind of problems!

144
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:44,148
Things you can't easily talk about
with other people.

145
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:47,216
Is there anything wrong
if we discuss our problems together?

146
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:48,283
Is that weird?

147
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:52,691
She found it easy to talk with us
about her problems...

148
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:54,358
so we listened and talked...

149
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:56,095
My problem.

150
00:17:57,137 --> 00:18:00,573
A sickness, thinking about
dirty things all the time.

151
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:04,938
That's it!

152
00:18:12,786 --> 00:18:16,882
What's going on here! Be quiet!
Let's begin the lecture.

153
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:21,022
Don't worry about that.

154
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:22,584
Cheer up! Noriko!

155
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:33,366
Arima is the only person
who's absent?

156
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:34,974
Let's start the lecture.

157
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:46,851
leda is a great man.
Everything he does looks cool.

158
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:52,051
You're acting like you're
the one who's in love with him.

159
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:16,613
Nice shot!

160
00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:47,079
What?
Are you going home alone?

161
00:19:47,814 --> 00:19:50,977
I'm sorry, I have to stop at
some places today.

162
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:54,514
All right.
Then be careful going home.

163
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:56,852
Yes, thank you for today.

164
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:58,415
No problem!

165
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:01,187
- See you!
- Take care.

166
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,534
Well, then you're
dating with leda too?

167
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:45,203
What's your relationship with them?

168
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,646
She's not dating either of us!

169
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:58,650
He's right.
We're just close friends.

170
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,114
Sorry.

171
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:09,786
I'm sorry. I always make
trouble for both of you.

172
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:18,229
I'm home.

173
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:44,293
Brother.

174
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,292
What's up?

175
00:21:49,035 --> 00:21:52,493
Brother, you wanted to talk to me
about something, didn't you?

176
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:55,333
Oh... about Yoshifuku, right?

177
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:57,699
Yoshifuku...

178
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:02,371
She was just worried about you.

179
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:04,447
Brother.

180
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:07,748
M-Miyuki.

181
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:09,883
It's all your fault.

182
00:22:11,224 --> 00:22:14,421
You and that woman,
Yoshifuku's fault.

183
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:20,055
I thought you were all mine
until I found out about her.

184
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:21,759
Miyuki...

185
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,901
Brother...
what do you think about me?

186
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,138
I really care about you.

187
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,807
So I wish I could accept
any kind of feelings from you.

188
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,342
Let's sit down.

189
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:44,790
But we shouldn't go beyond the border
of what a brother and sister can do.

190
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:47,349
There's something
we shouldn't express out loud.

191
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:48,826
I understand.

192
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:52,498
It may sound selfish, but...

193
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:56,160
You're not as selfish as I am.

194
00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:01,604
I'm sorry, brother.

195
00:23:13,553 --> 00:23:16,021
Brother, you'll be late for college.

196
00:23:17,157 --> 00:23:20,092
I'm leaving.
I have to hurry.

197
00:23:25,532 --> 00:23:27,500
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

198
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,132
Good morning.

199
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:33,671
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

200
00:23:45,952 --> 00:23:47,544
Good morning.

201
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,814
Miyuki, good morning.

202
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:52,488
Good morning.
It's really nice day.

203
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:56,695
Hurry up, Miyuki.

204
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:01,529
Wait! Brother.

205
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:03,565
You're always slow.

206
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:07,568
- Brother and sister.
- Miyuki, come on.

207
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,164
Ah, sorry!!
