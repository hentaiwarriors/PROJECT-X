00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:19,275
NURSE'S STATION

2
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,599
I turned off the lights. Is this ok?

3
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,607
Let me take a good
look at your pussy.

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,540
You're shaking.

5
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,787
A stormy night is a
nice change of pace.

6
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:18,242
Your pussy always smells so nice.

7
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:28,445
There's only one left.
I forgot to restock.

8
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,683
You didn't need this so...

9
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:36,027
I'm going to go ahead
and help myself.

10
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,444
Yes... This is great.

11
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,840
Come, get on all fours.

12
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,408
Hurry, come on.

13
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,817
Lift your ass up.

14
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,461
You drive me wild when
you moan like that.

15
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:55,197
Mystery of Nonomura Hospital
Episode 1

TRASH SCHEDULE

17
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,212
THE KAIBARA DETECTIVE AGENCY

18
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:18,826
WORK!!

19
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,838
Hello, this is the
Kaibara Detective Agency.

20
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:28,741
<i>HEY YOU JERK!! I've flnally got you on the phone!!
I want you to get out today and I mean it!</i>

21
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,006
Thank you for waking
me up every day.

22
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,770
<i>What?</i>

23
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,739
<i>I'm turning off all the electricity,
gas and water today! Just you wait!</i>

24
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,553
<i>I'm not listenlng to
your excuses anymore!</i>

25
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,145
<i>I'm coming right now
so you better not run!</i>

26
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,888
It's gonna be a wasted trip.

27
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,663
Off to work I go!
But first, let's eat!

28
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,029
MILK TEA

29
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,438
Today's the day I finally
eat a decent meal!

30
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,078
<i>Is this the Kalbara Detective Agency?</i>

31
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,446
Yes, it is.

32
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,483
<i>Is there a representative I can talk to?</i>

33
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,110
<i>My name is Akiko Nonomura.</i>

34
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,913
<i>I'd like to commission a job. Would it be
possible to set up an appointment?</i>

35
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:19,455
Hold on. Let me take
a look at my schedule.

36
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,718
Oh, I have time tomorrow morning.

37
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,860
<i>Then wlll you be able to
come tomorrow morning...?</i>

38
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,464
<i>...at ten to the president's
office at Nonomura Hospital?</i>

39
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,095
Nonomura Hospital...

40
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,371
The hospital where the
president committed suicide...?

41
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:36,809
<i>Yes. The police said it was a
suicide, but I'm not convinced.</i>

42
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,344
And you are?

43
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,279
<i>I am the late president's wife and
the vice president of the hospital.</i>

44
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,640
I see. I will be by tomorrow.

45
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,969
Ow... Watch what you're doing!
That was dangerous!

46
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,840
Oh, it's Ryoko Ito.
It's been a while.

47
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,212
It's me.

48
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,181
Takumaro Kaibara!!

49
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,357
Nice to bump into you.

50
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,720
I'd like an answer today.

51
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,926
I absolutely refuse
to be your assistant.

52
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,796
I'm working at the industry's
top firm, Saijyo Detective Agency.

53
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:40,470
Why should I work for you?

54
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,306
Once you become my assistant
you'll find out how great I am.

55
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,309
Keep talking.

56
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:49,647
All you do is stick your nose
in cases and cause trouble.

57
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,446
Geniuses are never acknowledged.

58
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,888
Anyway!! What are you
going to do about my suit?

59
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,113
You better buy me a new one!

60
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,386
I'll replace the inside
of your skirt, no problem.

61
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,559
Y-you idiot! Where do
you think you're looking!?

62
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,662
Pervert!! You're an
embarrassment to the industry!!

63
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,565
Once you see me analyze
a case first hand...

64
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,838
...you'll want to submit
your body and soul to me.

65
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,705
Yeah right.

66
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:25,111
Oh, no time to waste.
I have to go see my client.

67
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,956
My leg...

68
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:30,718
...is backwards.

69
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,224
I think you broke your leg.

70
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,400
NONOMURA HOSPITAL

71
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,892
What!? Your client is here?

72
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,899
You were commissioned too?

73
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,400
Yes.

74
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,943
We didn't tell her what she wanted
to hear, so she voided our contract.

75
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:50,610
RECEPTION DESK

76
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,947
<i>Takumaro Kaibara.
Please report to orthopedics.</i>

77
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,781
That's me.

78
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,973
Hey, lend me your shoulder.

79
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,594
Where do you think
you're grabbing, you pervert!!

80
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,562
It wasn't intentional.

81
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,199
ORTHOPEDICS

82
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,267
God... I'm only helping
you to the examination room.

83
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,670
I'm going home.

84
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,568
Take care of my bike!!

85
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:35,716
Where are we going?

86
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,557
NOGIWA

87
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,452
You're being admitted.

88
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:42,123
The semi-private rooms are all
full, so I've readied a private one.

89
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,252
A private room?

90
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,672
I can't see your panty line.

91
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:59,306
It's better not to be hated
by the hospital nurses.

92
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,149
It's my job to analyze.

93
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,746
Call the vice president.
She's my client.

94
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,317
Tell her it's Kaibara. She'll know.

95
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,224
Then you're the new
detective she hired?

96
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,628
That's right.

97
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,324
If you're wearing any...

98
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,602
It'd probably be relaxed-fit
thigh highs with frills.

99
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,230
Guessing from your
personality, the color would be...

100
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,734
Yes! It's got to be...

101
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,510
Translucent red!!

102
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,873
If you want to heal, you'd
better keep that mouth shut!

103
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,911
Miss Mamiya, can you
take care of the rest?

104
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:43,455
Oh, sure!

105
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,352
I'll go inform the vice president.

106
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,662
Guessing from how pissed
she got, I was probably right.

107
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,236
Please, this way.

108
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:56,531
OK.

109
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,406
Make sure you hold
on to my shoulder.

110
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,668
Thanks, I appreciate it.

111
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,940
You're welcome.

112
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,837
This hospital is loaded
with beautiful nurses.

113
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,114
Is this how the murdered
president liked it?

114
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,653
Murdered!?
Please don't say such things.

115
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,852
The police said that the
president committed suicide.

116
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,861
It's my job to take
up the cops' slack.

117
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,593
What? Then,
you're the new detective?

118
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,538
Word gets around fast here.

119
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,142
By the way, are those breasts real?

120
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,303
These thingies.

121
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,918
She's got big tits but
she's demure and shy.

122
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,147
Use this. The vice president wants
you to come to the president's office.

123
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,626
But it'll be easier if
I use the wheelchair.

124
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,263
You have to get used
to using crutches.

125
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,695
What are you doing!?

126
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:04,497
Ouch.

127
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:05,633
Jeez.

128
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,576
Ooo!!

129
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,192
No whistling in the hospital.

130
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,418
There were so many cute
girls, I just couldn't resist.

131
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:33,359
There are some awesome perks
to being admitted here, huh?

132
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,471
Miss Nogiwa!!

133
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,369
Yes!

134
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,332
Quiet in the hallways!

135
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,701
Okay.

136
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,705
Young nurses these days...

137
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,020
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

138
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,923
It's Miho, I've brought Mr. Kaibara.
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

139
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,151
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

140
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,856
Come in.

141
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,663
What do you think you're doing!?

142
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,223
A cockroach flew into your skirt!

143
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,868
Stop it!!
I said stop it!!

144
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,904
I knew you were wearing panties.

145
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,173
I was dead on about the color.

146
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,902
Damn you!!
You pervert!

147
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,010
Please excuse us.

148
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:20,971
I'm Takumaro.

149
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,249
I'm Akiko Nonomura.
Nice to meet you.

150
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,311
What was the ruckus about?

151
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,377
Oh, I was just practicing
my deduction skills.

152
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:33,525
Anyway... I didn't think you'd
be late from being admitted.

153
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,031
This is more convenient in a way.

154
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,398
But I wonder if you'll be
able work with your leg like that?

155
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,601
Come on, a sharp mind is...

156
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,563
...all I need.

157
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,932
I have my outside
information sources.

158
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,942
On top of that,
I have a great assistant.

159
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,812
I'll get straight to the point.

160
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,524
I can't have my husband's
death ruled a suicide.

161
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,617
I need you to find the murderer.

162
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,963
Because you won't be able to collect on
the insurance if he committed suicide?

163
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,532
You're pretty sharp.

164
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,557
You're not so bad yourself.

165
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,165
Bring in the file.

166
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,209
Are they bringing the files from the
female detective who was fired, too?

167
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,371
You're quite quick at
collecting information.

168
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,841
The investigation started
when I accepted the job.

169
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,597
Give it to him, Fujiki.

170
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,328
Yes, my Lady.

171
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:54,931
Thanks.

172
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,144
So would you like some coffee?
Or would you like...

173
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,874
I prefer tea.
Queen Marie preferably.

174
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,411
Fujiki, get it for him.

175
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,412
As you wish, my Lady.

176
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,612
You seem picky about your tea.

177
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,714
Like Holmes, every detective has
something to help them think.

178
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,520
I'll make sure to send
nothing but the best to your room.

179
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,299
Just don't start playing
a violin really badly.

180
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,596
What else would you need?

181
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:27,532
A hospital map, a master key to all the rooms,
a list of all the doctors, nurses, and staff...

182
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,970
...a list of patients, a list of
contractors who come and go...

183
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,380
...and an electric wheelchair.

184
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,143
This hospital is huge.

185
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,075
I'll ready all of that. By the way,
how much will all this cost?

186
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,446
For now, necessary expenses.
I'll bill the rest to you later.

187
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,150
Milk first.

188
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,727
Please.

189
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,242
There.

190
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,334
Thanks.

191
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,007
Mmm... It smells great.

192
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,847
<i>Score! This'll show my landlord!!</i>

193
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,981
Anything else?

194
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,989
I'd like you to tell the
nurses to cooperate.

195
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,860
Of course.

196
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,925
<i>Twice In one day!</i>

197
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,668
That should be enough.

198
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,065
Leave the rest to me.

199
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,472
You seem dependable.

200
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,005
I can tell you're different from the other
detectives by the look in your eyes.

201
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,980
Your body's different
from all my other clients, too.

202
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,646
You flatter me.

203
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,261
MAKINO

204
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,006
I brought the flowers.

205
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,743
<i>Put them in water please.</i>

206
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,267
Yes, of course.

207
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,179
Ouch...

208
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,045
<i>She was eavesdropping.</i>

209
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,745
I want more Baby's Breath.

210
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,450
Yes Ma'am. I'll change
the water, too.

211
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,965
Hey.

212
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,698
No!

213
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,434
CONSERVE WATER!!

214
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,275
<i>Why is she so scared of him?</i>

215
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:53,744
STORAGE ROOM

216
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,454
Watch your teeth.

217
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,352
Yeah, use your tongue.

218
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,331
Please... can this be the
last time we do this?

219
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,935
I can go to the police
and tell them, you know.

220
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,105
No. Please!

221
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,372
Then... You know what to do.

222
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,310
That's right. You're
getting pretty good.

223
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,990
You're crying down here too.

224
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,223
No...

225
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,226
Turn around!

226
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,924
Please, not that...

227
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,797
Hurry up and get on all fours!

228
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,541
Hurry up!

229
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,743
Obedience is best.

230
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:39,652
No!

231
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,365
Stop!

232
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:49,633
No!

233
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,207
Please stop!

234
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,577
No!

235
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,241
Stop...

236
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,607
This is great!

237
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,352
<i>Rie is getting blackmailed for something.</i>

238
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,895
Please! No more...

239
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,232
All right then.

240
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,535
See you next time.

241
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,478
Your face is really flushed. Are
you feeling all right, detective?

242
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,590
Oh, it's nothing.

243
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,423
H... hey.

244
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,469
Mr. Kaibara, your
room is on this floor.

245
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,030
Huh? Oh, that's right.

246
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,080
Is that man a detective?

247
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,978
Yup.

248
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:46,181
I wonder if he'll be
part of my story?

249
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,086
Yeah, I wonder?

250
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:49,822
KAIBARA

251
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,992
I can't believe I let that
sex scene affect me.

252
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,188
I'm still green.

253
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,168
Please excuse me.

254
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,472
By the way...

255
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,236
Why do you call
Madame Akiko 'My Lady'?

256
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:13,679
I have been serving as her butler
since before her marriage.

257
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,947
One more question.

258
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,974
Why hasn't she been grieving
since her husband died?

259
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,676
I'm sure because it
was a bad arrangement.

260
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,291
I can't say anything else.

261
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,358
If you need to know, you
should investigate it yourself.

262
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,134
So you've decided to
become my assistant?

263
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:39,805
What!? I brought you your bike.

264
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,740
And yeah, I might still
interested in the case, but...

265
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,673
I say that Fujiki guy is suspicious.

266
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:54,854
So, you still think that the murderer
is someone close to Madame Akiko?

267
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,048
Yes.

268
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:00,055
She took a out huge life insurance
policy on her husband six months ago.

269
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,687
That makes her look
really suspicious.

270
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,530
You turned your client into the
murderer. No wonder you were fired.

271
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,064
I just wanted to
uncover the truth!

272
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,173
Then, be my assistant so you can
continue to work on the case.

273
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,582
I guess I have no choice.

274
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:28,212
I'll be your assistant this
time. But only this once!

275
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,684
Then let's have a meeting
downstairs at the café.

276
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,624
Give me your shoulder.

277
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,426
I'm not going to
fall for that again.

278
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,234
Bitch.

279
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,003
Being a bitch is fine with me.

280
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,528
Fine. I'll use my wheelchair.

281
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,469
What's wrong?

282
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,430
It's about time I
finally get to eat.

283
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,796
I wonder if Fujiki put it there?

284
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,701
You shouldn't be so suspicious.

285
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,862
There are other people
who know where my room is...

286
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,305
And I seem to have the
attention of a few here as well...

287
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:31,246
I think the vice president wanted
the insurance money so...

288
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,355
There has to be a reason why
the police believe it's a suicide.

289
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,381
I know a magazine reporter who's
got an inside source with the police.

290
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,628
I want you to deliver a message.

291
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:45,730
Here's how to reach him.

292
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,596
Benzo Kawasaki, huh?
Ok then.

293
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:53,032
Oh, and lend me your cell.

294
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,632
I left mine at the office.

295
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,744
Here you go.

296
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,043
So Miss Assistant!
Let's get moving!!

297
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,978
What!? You're making me pay!?

298
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,299
Talk about a VIP hospital room!

299
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,810
<i>"The victim, Sakuji Nonomura...</i>

300
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,440
<i>...was found dead face-down on
the bed the day of the incident."</i>

301
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,717
<i>"The president sometimes utilized
this room for personal reasons."</i>

302
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,457
<i>"Status of the body when found:"</i>

303
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,727

gown and an undergarment."</i>

304

<i>"A used needle and
an ampul were found."</i>

305
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,394
<i>"The content of the ampul was cyanide."</i>

306
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,962
<i>"The estimated time of death was
between midnight and 06:00 AM."</i>

307
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,031
<i>"At 10:00 AM, Madame Akiko, the
first witness, became suspicious..."</i>

308
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:05,041
<i>"...when her husband didn't answer
the phone, and entered the room."</i>

309
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,671
<i>"At the time the body was found..."</i>

310
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:13,707
<i>"...Madame Akiko was accompanied by Fujiki,
the head nurse, and a security guard."</i>

311
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:18,924
<i>"During the estimated time of death,
her maid and personal driver..."</i>

312
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,087
<i>"...said Madame Akiko
was at the house in Kamakura."</i>

313
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,989
<i>"Outside entry is impossible."</i>

314
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,294
<i>"All fingerprints left in the room..."</i>

315
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:35,533
<i>"...Including the ampul and
needle, belonged to the victim."</i>

316
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,913
<i>"The official police
announcement declared it a suicide."</i>

317
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,312
<i>"It was supposedly
stemming from..."</i>

318
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,938
<i>"...the hospital's financial problems..."</i>

319
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,085
<i>"...and his country club's bankruptcy
when the economy began to decline."</i>

320

FAILING HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT
NONOMURA HOSPITAL PRESIDENT COMMITS SUICIDE

322
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,798
<i>It feels so good.</i>

323
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,668
<i>Your body feels great.</i>

324
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,636
<i>It's fantastic.</i>

325
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:08,231
<i>Look! My dick is so hard.</i>

326
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,610
What is this!?
Who's doing this!?

327
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,843
<i>Your beauty mark in your
pussy makes me so horny.</i>

328
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,509
<i>I love it when you cry like that.</i>

329
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,563
<i>You drive me wild when
you cry like that.</i>

330
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,795
Hello... Hello!

331
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:41,967
Who are you!?

332
00:25:55,195 --> 00:25:58,036
<i>To Be Continued...</i>

333
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,383
There's a murder case involving...

334
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:05,441
...the women at Nonomura Hospital.

335
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,049
There aren't very many suspects.

336
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:08,748
No one has a motive for the murder.

337
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,156
Embarrassing places are
searched and stretched around...

338
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,453
...right before my eyes.

339
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,157
Nice isn't it?

340
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,152
And then there's Ryoko,
caught up in the madness.

341
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:18,153
Fear not!

342
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,492
I'll solve the riddle that
gramps left behind!

343
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,932
But... just who is my grandpa?

344
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,162
Knock it off, you idiot!

345
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,998
Next time: The Mystery
of Nonomura Hospital

346
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,566
Hope you enjoy!
