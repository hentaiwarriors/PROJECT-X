1
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:41,382
It has been 32 years since the start
of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

2
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:44,943
lemitsu, the third Shogun,
now rules a seemingly peaceful nation.

3
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:49,425
There remain, however,
numerous problems still left unsettled.

4
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:56,530
Many forces are seeking to overthrow
the Tokugawa government...

5
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:59,967
and another cause for concern
is the clandestine Christians.

6
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:04,873
Are you sure that the clandestine
Christians have a meeting tonight?

7
00:01:05,276 --> 00:01:07,368
We're certain, sir!

8
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:45,479
Don't just stand there!
Capture this monster!

9
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,051
Why, you! Ring the bell!
We must warn the Lord!

10
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:42,134
Don't panic, men!

11
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:46,436
It's just an overgrown tiger
that's escaped from a freak show!

12
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:48,069
Calm down!

13
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:52,081
We must protect the princess!

14
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:14,568
Guns ready!

15
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:18,004
Fire!

16
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,468
Who's there?

17
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:02,681
Princess Mayu!

18
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:03,686
Intruders!

19
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:06,120
Guard the princess!

20
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:15,694
I'll get you.

21
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:18,634
Don't go, sir!
The thing is a monster!

22
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:21,604
- There is nothing we can do to stop it!
- Let go of me!

23
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:26,075
It's heading in the direction of
Edo Castle! We must protect our Lord!

24
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:31,171
Let me go! If I must give my life
to save the Lord, I will!

25
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:54,933
Out of my way, beast.

26
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:50,024
Thank you, sir! You have saved
our Lord from this monster!

27
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:53,255
Out of my way, sir.

28
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,270
What is your name, sir?

29
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:07,208
That's the crest of two scythes
crossing each other.

30
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:10,211
It's known as the "Scythes Of Death,"
sir, and is rarely used.

31
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:14,684
It should be quite easy to find out
who that man is, sir.

32
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:24,957
Roll up! Roll up!

33
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:27,589
Come and see
the amazing snake woman!

34
00:06:27,664 --> 00:06:31,566
A snake that's lived
for 200 years.

35
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:36,698
You'll never have seen anything
so strange as the amazing snake woman.

36
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,403
Hey, did you hear?

37
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:46,917
That tiger broke out of its cage
and killed 50 police officers.

38
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:49,752
Wish it could've
eaten my wife, too!

39
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:53,856
Your wife? Nah!

40
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:56,450
Not even a tiger
would be hungry enough to eat HER!

41
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:02,662
Excuse me.

42
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:06,333
Oh, I'm sorry.

43
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:14,236
Wait, sir!

44
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:17,366
You bear the crest
of crossed scythes.

45
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,169
You must be Shuranosuke Sakaki.

46
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:22,133
I am.

47
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:28,809
We have orders to kill you.

48
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:31,986
Let me warn you.

49
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:36,286
lf you wish to stay alive,
don't draw your swords.

50
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,957
Fools.

51
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:08,490
Amazing!

52
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,960
I'm very impressed.

53
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:16,888
Six men down in a single instant.
It's more than I'd expected.

54
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:21,869
So, these men were sacrificed
to test my power.

55
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:25,340
That's right.
They were loyal servants.

56
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:29,776
And I suppose
you're a loyal servant, too.

57
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:34,749
Gunbei Tashiro, of the Nakura clan.
I have my orders.

58
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:49,096
I have been taught by Master Katori
in the Divine Shinto style.

59
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:56,038
I have no master. I know no god.

60
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:57,971
What?

61
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:01,970
I think I deserve
some explanation for all this.

62
00:10:02,713 --> 00:10:04,840
After our bout is settled.

63
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:07,406
You may not be alive to tell.

64
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,756
The silent blow.

65
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,257
"Phantom."

66
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:30,534
"Phantom," you say.

67
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,509
So brief is human life.

68
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:52,689
Sakaki! Sir! Wait, please!

69
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:57,362
The man who slew a killer tiger
in a single blow.

70
00:10:57,434 --> 00:11:00,766
I had my men look all over Edo...

71
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:04,431
for the man bearing
the "Scythes of Death."

72
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:08,638
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

73
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:13,343
I am Daizen Imura.

74
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:16,318
I am in charge of overseeing
the affairs of the Nakura clan in Edo.

75
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:18,785
Intruders in the house! Intruders!

76
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:22,755
There is something
we must ask of you.

77
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:33,693
The tiger was probably used
as a decoy...

78
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,761
to draw the guards away
from the Princess.

79
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,104
The intruders succeeded
in taking her away.

80
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,144
Princess!

81
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:57,086
The Princess will be
returned safely...

82
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,424
in exchange for the Ginryu Sword.

83
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:04,523
Send one man to bring the sword
to the Benten Shrine in Ueno...

84
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:07,092
tomorrow night
at the hour of the Boar.

85
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,196
If our demand is not met,
the Princess will be raped and killed...

86
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:14,403
and her body will be exposed
for all to see.

87
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:15,945
The Seki Ninja.

88
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:21,107
The Seki Ninja.

89
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:26,349
The notorious group of Ninja
that served Motonari Mohri.

90
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:30,324
Unfortunately there is no one
in the Nakura clan...

91
00:12:30,393 --> 00:12:34,557
who can fight them single-handedly
to rescue the Princess.

92
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:43,032
Please, Sakaki!
Save our Princess!

93
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:01,223
You're back early today,
Shuranosuke.

94
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:06,455
That's one year's
advance payment of the rent.

95
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,929
Ah. Business is booming, eh?

96
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,593
Petty job.

97
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,099
Oh, yes.

98
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,901
You have a visitor.

99
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:20,670
A visitor?

100
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,240
Well, hello.

101
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,420
How did you find me?

102
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:39,222
Ha. That crest on your kimono.

103
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:42,627
The "Scythe of Death" is considered
very unlucky. It is rarely used.

104
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:46,830
A handsome fella wearing
the "Scythe of Death."

105
00:13:46,903 --> 00:13:50,339
It wasn't too hard to find you,
Sakaki-san.

106
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,303
What do you want?

107
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:57,836
You know what I want.
Embarrassing a girl in public like that.

108
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:01,981
It seems
I've fallen in love with you.

109
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:05,480
My name's Oren,
the Kishibojin Goddess.

110
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:19,326
This is why I got my nickname.

111
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:27,269
Hey, Sakaki-san.

112
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:29,777
You do more than
kill tigers, don't you?

113
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:03,970
Do you hate me so much
that you want to kill me?

114
00:15:04,046 --> 00:15:08,675
Any man I sleep with
has to be hateful, so coldhearted...

115
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:14,314
and so dangerous
that he could kill me anytime.

116
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:20,291
Oren, huh. I like you.

117
00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:24,289
Heaven and hell
both exist on earth.

118
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:27,201
I'll take you to them.

119
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:37,544
I love you, Sakaki-san!

120
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:51,926
Hey, send me to hell
one more time.

121
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:54,893
You'd better go now.

122
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:58,900
Otherwise you might end up
going to hell for real.

123
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,401
What?

124
00:16:28,998 --> 00:16:30,898
The Seki Ninja.

125
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:32,966
Come out.

126
00:16:33,036 --> 00:16:36,095
Kill one, kill two,
it's the same to me.

127
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,568
This is a graveyard for lost souls.

128
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:44,578
What better place for you to die.

129
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:26,286
I'll get you!

130
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:23,676
Opium is made by drying
the sap of poppies.

131
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:30,014
It has been used over the years
as a sedative, and as a narcotic.

132
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:33,655
Any order given
under the influence of a drug...

133
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:36,557
is said to have
strong suggestive powers.

134
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:40,085
The Mizari cult
is known to have used drugs...

135
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:43,928
to control their assassins.

136
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:11,887
The Ginryu Sword, the treasure
of the Sugawara household...

137
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:14,258
is about to fall into the hands
of the Seki Ninja.

138
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,630
Mio. Pretty Mio.

139
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:21,599
Bring me the Ginryu Sword.

140
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:24,197
Yes, Okuni.

141
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:28,505
Yes, I will...
get you the Ginryu Sword.

142
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:53,724
The Eikanji Temple
at Toueizan Mountain in Ueno...

143
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:58,571
was built to ward off demons
from the Edo Castle.

144
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:06,012
The Shinobazu Pond is located on
the southwest corner of Eikanji Temple.

145
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,982
There are no bridges
to Benten Island.

146
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:24,354
Welcome, Shuranosuke Sakaki!

147
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:28,555
I am Dogan,
the leader of the Seki Ninja!

148
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,827
Have you brought the sword?

149
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:37,269
Where is Princess Mayu?

150
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:55,113
Are you Princess Mayu?

151
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:58,093
Yes. And you are?

152
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:01,523
Just a hired hand.

153
00:22:01,597 --> 00:22:04,430
Thank you for coming.

154
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,310
Ah. The Ginryu Sword.

155
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:30,549
The way I figure it, you used
some kind of drug to excite that tiger.

156
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:33,151
And while all attention
was focused on the tiger...

157
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:37,029
you kidnapped Princess Mayu,
daughter of the Nakura clan leader.

158
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:43,499
Why go through all this trouble?

159
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:46,439
Why do you so desire
the Ginryu Sword?

160
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:50,410
It seems like
an interesting enough tale...

161
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:52,743
to tell over a bottle of sake.

162
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:56,978
Too bad. You won't be able
to drink sake in hell.

163
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:14,734
Why did you kill the boatkeeper
and his family?

164
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:19,604
No one sees the Seki Ninja
and lives to tell about it.

165
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:22,473
They were unlucky, that's all.

166
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,447
Why did you have to kill the boy?

167
00:23:25,514 --> 00:23:29,472
Whimpered like a pup
when I stabbed him.

168
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:35,053
Shuranosuke.

169
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,426
Shuranosuke.

170
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:41,792
You louse. Die!

171
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:29,442
Stop right there, Shuranosuke!
Throw down your sword.

172
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:33,174
Let he go. I promised
to bring her home safely.

173
00:24:34,384 --> 00:24:36,875
You'll be bringing back
her dead body.

174
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:39,944
Try it, and the Nakura clan
will also receive YOUR head...

175
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,580
as a special gift from me.

176
00:24:43,092 --> 00:24:45,026
How interesting.

177
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:48,223
What are you waiting for?
Kill me now!

178
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:53,523
Will you answer
just one question, Sakaki?

179
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:55,836
Yes?

180
00:24:57,339 --> 00:25:02,470
What is love? I shall die
without ever experiencing it!

181
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:07,514
Love is like the morning dew.

182
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,347
It stays in this world
only for a fleeting moment.

183
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:13,946
Perhaps it does not even
belong to this world.

184
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:19,590
I see. Now I am ready to die.

185
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,654
Take my head off, you lout!

186
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:26,065
Wait!

187
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:35,704
Go on, throw down your weapons!

188
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:38,303
No, don't!

189
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:52,758
Come!

190
00:25:55,732 --> 00:25:58,359
After them! Kill them both!

191
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:15,347
Who are you?

192
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:46,780
Who are you?
You're not the Iga or Koga ninjas!

193
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:49,744
We've come for the Ginryu Sword!

194
00:27:36,366 --> 00:27:38,128
Out of our way, you monster.

195
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:32,413
"Kunoichi" (women) ninjas!

196
00:28:32,487 --> 00:28:36,651
No. You must be the Himiko Ninja!

197
00:28:48,905 --> 00:28:50,770
Finish him!

198
00:29:00,683 --> 00:29:02,150
Let's go!

199
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,208
Not so fast!

200
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:07,551
They don't call me
"Dogan the Invincible" for nothing.

201
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:38,408
Give me back the Ginryu Sword.

202
00:29:53,535 --> 00:29:55,435
Come back here!

203
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:16,456
Is heaven a place like this?

204
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,956
You're not...

205
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,089
Don't you ever think about dying?

206
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:30,605
Love is like the morning dew.
Is human life like that, too?

207
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:33,304
I wonder.

208
00:30:37,347 --> 00:30:41,407
Sakaki! Shuranosuke Sakaki!

209
00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:46,818
We've been sent by the Nakura clan
to retrieve Princess Mayu.

210
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,790
Here, take my hand, Princess.

211
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:53,658
No!

212
00:31:02,805 --> 00:31:04,432
Get down!

213
00:31:12,047 --> 00:31:14,105
You monster!

214
00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:46,780
No! Murakami! No!

215
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:55,948
Shinbei, Kota...

216
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:57,855
Koichiro.

217
00:31:57,926 --> 00:32:00,621
They all died for me.

218
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:07,802
Hold on tight.

219
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:49,844
Death is in the air tonight.

220
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:56,578
The smell ofblood.
Many lives have been lost.

221
00:32:57,385 --> 00:33:00,376
The streets of Edo
can be dangerous at night, sir.

222
00:33:00,455 --> 00:33:02,513
You must take caution.

223
00:33:08,897 --> 00:33:12,263
How much longer?
How much longer do we have to go?

224
00:33:13,068 --> 00:33:15,332
Just a little further, sir.

225
00:33:15,403 --> 00:33:19,031
I've been ordered to guide you
to Lord Tsusaka's mansion, you see.

226
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:20,268
Stop here.

227
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:23,277
Stop here.
This seems like a good spot.

228
00:33:24,347 --> 00:33:28,784
You smell of blood, too.
The blood of many men.

229
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:34,110
It's difficult to hide
who you are.

230
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:39,286
You must be quite confident
that you can beat me.

231
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:42,387
Otherwise, you wouldn't
turn your back to the enemy.

232
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:47,626
Tsusaka must have
hired you to kill me.

233
00:33:47,703 --> 00:33:50,364
You'd be smart
to call the deal off now.

234
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:54,933
Why waste your life
for a no-good embezzler like that?

235
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:58,502
Thanks for the offer, but...

236
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,013
it's my policy to carry out
any contract to the end.

237
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,846
I'd even kill my own brother
if it came down to it.

238
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:05,677
I see.

239
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:09,656
And I might not be the one
to end up dead.

240
00:34:16,032 --> 00:34:20,162
Kazuma Utsuki. Superintendent officer
for the Okayama clan!

241
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:25,236
I am Marouji, the assassin.

242
00:34:25,974 --> 00:34:29,272
Where is your weapon?
Have you a dagger hidden somewhere?

243
00:34:44,225 --> 00:34:46,455
Ah. Jujitsu, eh?

244
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:49,459
Kamui-style martial arts.

245
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:51,787
I see.

246
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:55,461
You're the third assassin sent by them,
and by far the most intimidating.

247
00:35:24,033 --> 00:35:26,934
Are you married, Marouji?
Any children?

248
00:35:27,703 --> 00:35:29,135
How about you?

249
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:31,966
I have a daughter.

250
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,237
She just turned three this spring.

251
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,778
She's going to grow up
into a beautiful woman.

252
00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:41,044
Ah. That's something
to look forward to.

253
00:35:41,116 --> 00:35:42,947
Don't worry about me.

254
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:47,115
No one's going to cry for me
when I'm dead.

255
00:36:06,508 --> 00:36:07,940
Mika.

256
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,341
Your daughter's name?

257
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:31,297
Where are we heading?

258
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:34,802
There's an inn near the Suwa Shrine
that's run by a friend.

259
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:37,736
We'll hide there for tonight.

260
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:40,975
Oh, how pretty.

261
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:07,697
Hmm. It seems a little early
for the festival of the dead.

262
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,329
The lanterns will soon be carrying
YOUR spirit to hell.

263
00:37:17,512 --> 00:37:21,470
This is the gateway to hell,
the River Styx.

264
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:26,010
I am Kagairo, a Seki Ninja.

265
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:08,254
Lanterns to greet the spirits,
lanterns to carry them away.

266
00:39:08,324 --> 00:39:10,291
In hell, there's nothing
but darkness.

267
00:39:17,031 --> 00:39:18,759
Shuranosuke.

268
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:29,104
Who is it at this hour?
We're closed already.

269
00:39:31,613 --> 00:39:33,307
Oh! It's you, Shuranosuke!

270
00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:37,040
You should've told me
you were coming.

271
00:39:37,118 --> 00:39:40,086
Oh, look.
You're all wet.

272
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:44,256
Who's your friend?

273
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:45,952
We'd like to stay the night.

274
00:39:46,528 --> 00:39:48,620
Oh, come on!
How old is she, anyway?

275
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:51,928
You sure know how to hurt
a girl's feelings.

276
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,900
Please! Come in, young lady!
You're very welcome here!

277
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:02,434
One minute you think he likes you,
and the next...

278
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:06,274
And to think I believed him
when he said he preferred older women.

279
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:08,237
You liar!

280
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:38,468
What's the matter?

281
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:50,816
I can't sleep.
Please, let me hold you for a while.

282
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:04,969
Just as I thought.

283
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,031
You're really a very warm person.

284
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:11,045
I killed my parents...

285
00:41:11,113 --> 00:41:13,808
and my younger brother.

286
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:20,752
How can a man like that be "warm"?

287
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:22,686
But...

288
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:28,795
Shuranosuke.

289
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,938
Get some rest.

290
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:03,655
Princess Mayu!
You're all right!

291
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:06,598
Princess! Princess Mayu!

292
00:42:21,215 --> 00:42:23,205
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

293
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:27,180
Here's the rest of your reward.

294
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:30,120
Please. You have earned it.

295
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,220
Words aren't enough
to express our appreciation.

296
00:42:35,296 --> 00:42:38,094
Go on. The money is yours.

297
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:42,429
Why are you dressed like that?

298
00:42:44,038 --> 00:42:45,903
Well, Sakaki...

299
00:42:45,973 --> 00:42:50,410
we must ask you
for just one more favor.

300
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:52,104
What?

301
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,946
You must give your life for us...
right now.

302
00:42:56,684 --> 00:42:58,151
I am sorry.

303
00:43:06,695 --> 00:43:09,163
lf you want my life...

304
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:11,858
you can have it.

305
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:14,094
But I'm going to take
your head with me!

306
00:43:16,105 --> 00:43:18,868
Of course.

307
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:21,875
That's why I'm dressed to die.

308
00:43:21,944 --> 00:43:27,473
To protect the Nakura clan,
I'd give up my wretched life any day!

309
00:43:30,452 --> 00:43:32,317
Prepare to fire!

310
00:43:36,724 --> 00:43:41,353
Remember, men, shoot us both!
Through the heart!

311
00:43:42,798 --> 00:43:45,129
- Stop!
- Princess Mayu!

312
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:47,690
Stop! Stop! Stop!

313
00:43:49,737 --> 00:43:53,035
Daizen! What is the meaning of this?

314
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:57,408
Sakaki saved my life!
I will not allow such absurdity!

315
00:43:58,279 --> 00:44:01,373
Princess, this is for the good
of our clan! Please understand!

316
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:03,177
No!

317
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:05,947
It goes against
all human decency!

318
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,282
Princess Mayu!

319
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:08,753
Go on, shoot!

320
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:13,689
But you will have to kill ME first!

321
00:44:21,669 --> 00:44:23,101
Princess! Princess Mayu!

322
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:26,300
Take her to her room!
And call the doctor!

323
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:39,110
Put your guns down! Go!
You're not needed here!

324
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:56,564
Forgive me.

325
00:45:01,843 --> 00:45:04,174
This is yours.

326
00:45:06,614 --> 00:45:09,447
Throw a stone at a stray dog...

327
00:45:09,517 --> 00:45:11,985
and it'll never
take food from you again.

328
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:13,645
Goodbye.

329
00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:27,126
Shuranosuke.

330
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:47,249
Ah, I see it.

331
00:45:47,823 --> 00:45:51,384
So, the white tiger
has been slain.

332
00:45:51,459 --> 00:45:54,393
One of god's four incarnates
has been destroyed.

333
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,495
So be it.
It's an ordeal we must undergo.

334
00:46:04,572 --> 00:46:07,335
It's a test to see whether
the Tokugawa will rule...

335
00:46:07,408 --> 00:46:09,876
for generations to come,
or be overthrown.

336
00:46:11,546 --> 00:46:14,379
This is all a test!

337
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:36,402
Wow, it's bad.

338
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:45,139
I don't know who you are, sir,
but it's bad. Really bad.

339
00:46:46,914 --> 00:46:48,074
What is?

340
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:51,278
The smell of blood.

341
00:46:51,352 --> 00:46:55,118
I can smell it from a mile away.
Yeah, you stink of blood, sir.

342
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,757
Maybe I stink of blood too.

343
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,262
I wonder.

344
00:47:08,903 --> 00:47:12,669
We need to find a place to die.
Pretty soon.

345
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:17,139
That's what I've been thinking.

346
00:47:18,246 --> 00:47:21,340
What else can we do?
