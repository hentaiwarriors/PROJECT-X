1
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:30,022
Hi, Mommy!
Let's go play outside!

2
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:42,539
Mommy, you're back!

3
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:50,471
Karura and Kuaru have returned, Master.

4
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:52,342
We're back.

5
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:53,510
Hi.

6
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:57,451
We went to see North America.

7
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,884
Are there any survivors?

8
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:08,232
Is that all Kuaru does?!

9
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,602
I guess she's
no different from us.

10
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:49,107
I'm going to come!

11
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,102
Master!

12
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:26,167
I think we have too many children.

13
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:29,011
It's our population strategy for the new era.

14
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:31,276
We have over 30,000 kids.

15
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:35,114
Fine for you, all you do is plant your seed.

16
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,221
You haven't done anything either,
just give birth.

17
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,588
You don't understand.

18
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,091
Just don't spoil him.

19
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:45,523
What?!

20
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,408
What is it, Neptune?

21
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:01,173
Um, it's... uh...

22
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,436
Neptune!

23
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:03,745
What?!

24
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,340
Great!

25
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:09,412
Um... uh... I'll explain later!

26
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,522
We must return him to normal.

27
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,456
Let's stroke him.

28
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:42,818
Don't stop!

29
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:05,433
What just happened?

30
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:10,378
It means your Atlantean powers
are awakening.

31
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:11,643
Say what?

32
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:16,677
Master, we must take you
to the Floating Continent.

33
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:20,090
In order to awaken your true powers.

34
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:22,919
Once your original powers
are restored...

35
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:25,156
...saving the world
won't be just a dream.

36
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,629
It's the truth.

37
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:29,258
To Laputa, the Floating Continent.

38
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,097
We'll take the four golden balls...

39
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,228
...and receive the super-divine spirit.

40
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:35,034
Are you serious?

41
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,104
I am, Master.

42
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:38,608
To Laputa!

43
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,805
We'll get the silver skull.

44
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:05,765
Laputa. The phantom silver skull.

45
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:09,739
Not if I can get my hands on it first.

46
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,381
What is this place?

47
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:07,897
Legend has it the survivors
of Atlantis live here.

48
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:20,837
But they're all women.

49
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,483
What is that?!

50
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:30,749
That's a squiggly,
a degenerated Atlantis man.

51
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:35,589
The one significant thing
in their lives was sex.

52
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:40,489
What happened the other day?

53
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:45,798
Master hasn't been himself
lately, right?

54
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:49,601
So I mixed up some of
Laputa's secret medicine.

55
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,741
You mean, those squiggly things?

56
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:56,708
Yes, I wanted him to have
more vitality, so I gave him...

57
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,340
...the medicine.

58
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,146
That's why he was so huge!

59
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:01,014
Right.

60
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:03,554
That explains the phantom silver skull.

61
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:04,987
If we get it.

62
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,287
If we can get the real stuff...!

63
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:09,657
He'll be his old self again!

64
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:12,720
You got it! That's all we need!

65
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,460
What is it, Master?

66
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,469
Wait a second.

67
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:23,975
If I reawaken as an Atlantean,
won't I become like that?

68
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:27,268
I'm sure you'll be fine. I think.

69
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:28,471
You think?

70
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:33,579
Anyway, the important thing
is saving the world!

71
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:35,384
She's right!

72
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,183
Listen to you.

73
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:42,487
Come on. Don't think
about a thing, Master.

74
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:45,428
Wait! What's that
supposed to mean?! Hey!

75
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:03,746
Estelle has arrived.

76
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:35,640
Master, you're flaking a bit...

77
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:46,217
I am Estelle,
leader of the Floating Continent.

78
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,282
Pleased to see you again.

79
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,888
It's been so long
since I've seen you, Krishna.

80
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:54,454
12,000 years, in fact.

81
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:58,002
Krishna! Was that my name in Atlantis?

82
00:08:59,437 --> 00:09:01,064
Forgive me.

83
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,939
You've come here
to awaken your legendary powers.

84
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,840
Uh, yes, well...

85
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,771
Krishna... I mean Mr. Kanzaki.

86
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:16,081
You need the phantom silver skull,
the bible of love.

87
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:22,617
No one has ever come this far
in search of the skull.

88
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:29,990
And no one has ever passed the test
and lived to tell about it.

89
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:35,601
Many tried to escape
and were met with death.

90
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,609
You're not going to make him
take the test, are you?

91
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:42,112
Of course I am.

92
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,010
What?!

93
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:50,110
This is the legendary...

94
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,614
So Laputa really did exist.

95
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:05,399
Let us begin the test.

96
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,732
Okay.

97
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,895
She's an amazon!

98
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:49,074
First, I'll get you to do it
to this woman.

99
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:50,079
What?

100
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:52,139
It's part of the test.

101
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:54,242
What the hell's going to happen?

102
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,683
Get started!

103
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:58,077
Yes!

104
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:06,720
She's huge! I could stick
my whole head in there.

105
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:07,787
Here goes.

106
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,203
Hang on!
What's going on?!

107
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:22,943
A test.

108
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:25,847
Release your hands
and hang by your penis.

109
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:30,584
And she will cross over
the rails up ahead.

110
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:41,496
The power of your penis
will have to carry you through.

111
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:48,839
Many have succumbed here...

112
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:51,137
...and have become shark food.

113
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:52,938
- Do it!
- Master!

114
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,773
I can't!

115
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:57,508
Ow!

116
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:01,446
Whoah! Hang on a minute!

117
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:06,214
Don't give up, Master!
Do it to save the world!

118
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,954
Yeah, right, the world.
But what if this kills me?

119
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:13,657
Imagine you're with us,
and keep at it!

120
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,431
I don't want to die like this!

121
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:35,947
Just a little longer,
Master! Keep it up!

122
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,827
What a relief!

123
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,295
You did it!

124
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:48,693
Wonderful performance, Kanzaki.

125
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:57,037
What the hell was
that test all about?

126
00:13:00,912 --> 00:13:05,315
Welcome to Laputa.
I hear you are a friend of Kanzaki.

127
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,187
That's right. I'm Kanzaki's friend.

128
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,986
His good friend.

129
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:28,302
I'm Mutsuki.
I came here to speak with Kanzaki.

130
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:31,171
I'm afraid he's a little tied up
at the moment.

131
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:34,211
I know.
I won't interrupt the test.

132
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:35,739
You know?

133
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,374
I know everything about him.

134
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,782
I'll wait until he's finished.

135
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,216
Surely you'd be bored
just sitting here waiting.

136
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:48,023
Wouldn't you like to join him?

137
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,121
No, thank you.

138
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:53,554
Please. It's a lot of fun.

139
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:57,768
Really. There's no point
in my taking part.

140
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,201
I'll wait.

141
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,295
I see. What a shame.

142
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:04,705
I'll call for you once he's done.
Excuse me.

143
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:11,709
Something's strange.

144
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,115
What's this?

145
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:19,588
A test of control.

146
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:21,682
I'm going to light that rope.

147
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,923
You must ejaculate before
the rope burns through.

148
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:28,456
The rope will burn through
in 1 minute.

149
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,262
What? 1 minute!?

150
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:34,629
A man must be able to perform sex
in all conditions...

151
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,174
...to leave a descendent.

152
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:40,736
Hardly a reason for making it a test.

153
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:43,576
This is very serious.

154
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:47,675
The servants may assist.

155
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:49,083
Yes!

156
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:53,983
The flame.

157
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,927
How can I perform?!

158
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,755
I'm going to come!

159
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,663
Magnificent, Kanzaki.

160
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,141
You live up to your position
as savior of Atlantis.

161
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:50,512
Master!

162
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,142
I thought I was a goner.

163
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:03,627
You were so powerful, Master!

164
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,190
Sure were!

165
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:08,289
Doesn't anything strike you as odd?

166
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,361
Like what?

167
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:13,461
Like I should be working
on my Atlantean powers...

168
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,768
...but I'm just having sex!

169
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,603
- It only seems that way.
- Yeah!

170
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:21,736
Is there something
we've neglected to do for you.

171
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,508
Don't you think there is?

172
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:27,774
But, Master, you've become
much better since arriving.

173
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,248
I have to say, I do feel better.

174
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,782
See, Master?

175
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:38,124
Come here, you imp!

176
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:40,397
Not fair! Me too!

177
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:59,610
Estelle, I've brought
an especially large squiggly today.

178
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:03,383
I don't want it.
I need a real man.

179
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:05,888
Tomorrow's the big day.

180
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:08,551
You must be patient tonight.

181
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,620
I'm so wet.

182
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:16,133
I need Kanzaki's hot penis inside me.

183
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:19,029
I need him now!

184
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:28,343
It's all been one big ride, Kanzaki.
But it'll all end soon.

185
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:31,780
Take revenge for past misdeeds.

186
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:34,909
And open the doors to God.

187
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:37,079
- Excuse me, Master?
- What is it?

188
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:39,723
Why a dolphin?

189
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,691
I'm happy.

190
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,659
It's so embarrassing!

191
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:56,869
You've arrived for your final test.

192
00:17:56,974 --> 00:18:01,172
With your power,
I'm sure you'll have no problems.

193
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,712
If you complete this test,
then as promised...

194
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:05,112
I get the phantom silver skull.

195
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,673
You will.

196
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,576
Good luck, Master!

197
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:12,579
Servants, wait in your rooms.

198
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,124
How come?

199
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,253
It is the way of Laputa.

200
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,197
This way.

201
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:34,704
Are you ready, Kanzaki?
It's a very difficult test.

202
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:37,680
That's what will happen to you
if you fail.

203
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:44,982
These are all the men who
passed all but the final test.

204
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:47,889
What is the phantom
silver skull, anyway?

205
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:50,951
Is it more than something
to awaken my original powers?

206
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:53,087
I cannot answer that.

207
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,469
Kanzaki?

208
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,940
Estelle!

209
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,706
We will begin the final test.

210
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,273
Give me 10,000 years worth
of a woman's pleasure.

211
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:18,687
The final test is how much
manly love you can give.

212
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,695
Come, Kanzaki.

213
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:35,666
Okay. Here goes.

214
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,545
Harder!

215
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,200
Oh, yes!

216
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:21,046
This is sex!

217
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:24,052
We've only just begun.

218
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,692
Deeper! Deeper!

219
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:52,646
The pleasure of 1,000 years!

220
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:56,779
I wonder what kind of test he's having?

221
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:58,048
He's taking ages.

222
00:20:58,122 --> 00:21:01,353
It could only be one kind, in this place.

223
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:05,755
We should destroy this place
as soon as we get the silver skull.

224
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:10,698
Oh, it feels so good!

225
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:18,500
I could last 10,000 years like this.

226
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:31,177
I'm going to burst!

227
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,157
I'm going to come!

228
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:45,066
10,000 years of pleasure!

229
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,412
Your performance in the final test
was impeccable.

230
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:00,746
As promised, I give this to you.

231
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:02,651
Thank you.

232
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,984
Congratulations, Master!

233
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,648
Thanks.

234
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:13,658
I've caused the destruction
of humanity twice now.

235
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:18,668
It gives me great pleasure
to think I can leave with this.

236
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:22,772
You're right, Master.

237
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,003
Let's hurry back to the Tower of Babel.

238
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:28,436
Yes, and we'll use the silver skull.

239
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:29,945
Yeah! Good idea!

240
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:32,539
Okay, let's do it!

241
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:36,052
That's right, Kanzaki.

242
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,750
You'd better take those
Atlantean powers with you.

243
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:43,817
But you won't be going back
to the Tower of Babel.

244
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:47,394
Mutsuki! You were alive!

245
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:49,297
What's with the get up?

246
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,795
It's my hobby.

247
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:53,700
Nothing fun about it.

248
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:55,628
Get to the point, Mutsuki!

249
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:57,907
Why'd you come here?

250
00:22:57,975 --> 00:22:59,135
What's this, Estelle?

251
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:02,371
Kanzaki is the first
Krishna in 12,000 years.

252
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,042
I'm not letting him go.

253
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:07,343
And for him to be reborn
as an Atlantean...

254
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:10,012
It's better for me that
it's not at the Tower.

255
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:13,321
Our goals were well matched.

256
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,519
If you want a man, Estelle,
just take Mutsuki here.

257
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:19,287
Thanks, but no thanks.

258
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:22,365
Well, I'm not human after all, am I.

259
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:25,402
Aren't you embarrassed about that?

260
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:31,098
With all that has gone on
over the years...

261
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:34,770
You have lost your powers.

262
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:44,151
Well, that's the best I can do.

263
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:53,128
It's showtime!

264
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,533
I've taken the skull.

265
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:01,230
We'll meet again...

266
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:02,464
Wait, Mutsuki!

267
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:10,071
And we just got our hands
on that medicine!

268
00:24:10,147 --> 00:24:11,171
What's that?

269
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:14,040
Don't just stand there, you guys!

270
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:15,881
Karura, follow Unit V.

271
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:18,114
Kuaru, you deal with the soldiers.

272
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:22,256
Neptune!

273
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:27,327
Oh, no, you don't!

274
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:28,592
Jupiter!

275
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:39,673
Answer me, Neptune!

276
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:40,574
Master?

277
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:43,306
This isn't the right time for this!

278
00:24:58,329 --> 00:24:59,762
Kuaru, I leave this to you!

279
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,525
Neptune! Don't run away!

280
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,537
Shit! I knew something was wrong.

281
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:18,711
You bitch!

282
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,479
That's Unit V,
Master of Pai Chen, to you!

283
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:25,781
You copycat.

284
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,323
Nobody's going to like you.

285
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,217
Is that what you have to say?

286
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,654
Kuaru!

287
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:48,501
How dare you!

288
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:39,091
Karura!

289
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:45,730
That's it.

290
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,632
Return, Unit V.

291
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:53,332
I have the silver skull, Kanzaki.

292
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,638
Until we meet again!

293
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:09,490
Don't worry.
At least we're all safe.

294
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,321
My deepest apologies.

295
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:12,521
Forget it, Estelle.

296
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:17,329
In four or five years,
our children will live on earth.

297
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:20,898
Will my sons get to have
as much fun as me?

298
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:22,871
Come on...

299
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,964
Right?!

300
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:29,603
So Krishna means "guest"
in Laputa's language.

301
00:27:30,447 --> 00:27:35,407
And I spend my time
in Atlantis playing out fantasies.

302
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:36,544
Unreal.

303
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,484
Don't you owe me an apology?

304
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:41,319
Sorry!

305
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:54,496
Oh, no!

306
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:56,801
What is it, Master?

307
00:27:57,841 --> 00:28:00,105
You bathed in the silver skull!

308
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:01,976
Me too!!

309
00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:04,810
Hey, what about me?
