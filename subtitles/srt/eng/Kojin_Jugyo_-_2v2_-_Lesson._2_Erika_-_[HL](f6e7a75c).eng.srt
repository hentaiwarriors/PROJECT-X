1
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,840
A generous bosom.

2
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,410
A killer body.

3
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,320
And a superior intellect.

4
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,380
Her name is Sara Iijima.

5
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,930
A Stunford graduate
in psychofeed theory.

6
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,590
She is a brilliant psychotherapist.

7
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,360
She has teamed up with
me, her assistant, Tamine...

8
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,870
to fight the Japanese education
system and correct its flaws.

9
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,700
What are you doing, Tamine?

10
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,110
Sara! Well I was, ah...

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,880
What is it?

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,280
Nothing at all!

13
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,290
Come on, I want to know.

14
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,720
No really...

15
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,520
What are you hiding?

16
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,120
What's the matter with you?

17
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,380
The anxieties of people
in modern times.

18
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,410
Unsure of who they are
or where they are going.

19
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,750
What on earth are they searching for?

20
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,590
It's so good!

21
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,700
I hate them!

22
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,580
To help guide these lost sheep...

23
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,850
a D-cup angel of mercy appears.

24
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,920
Her name is Sara Iijima.

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,370
<i>The secret Omote Sando
psychofeed therapy!</i>

26
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,720
She is a brilliant psychotherapist.

27
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,220
She uses her ample bosom
to penetrate the subconscious...

28
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,730
and to employ her psychofeed therapy.

29
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,360
She opens the doors to
the souls of those people...

30
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,700
who have stubbornly kept them closed.

31
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,500
How old are you, Yuri?

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,210
Three.

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,410
Sara confronts their
fears and anxieties...

34
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,950
She probes deep into their insecurities.

35
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,480
To challenge their demons...

36
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,990
she encourages them to
use their own strengths...

37
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,650
so they can understand
and overcome their problems.

38
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,120
Only then do they
discover their true selves.

39
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,010
The lesson is over.

40
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,420
Today, Sara is at a college
with such troubled students.

41
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,850
And together with her
assistant, Tamine...

42
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,420
she'll save the souls of the students.

43
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,290
Sara, was Erika Shimada
such a brilliant student?

44
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,980
Yes. We attended Dr. Chang's
lectures at Stunford.

45
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,590
She's very diligent and talented.

46
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,530
Sara, you've finally come.

47
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,530
She saved my butt a few times,
with papers and labs.

48
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,300
Well, that's quite something...

49
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,770
I can't imagine you needing help.

50
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,310
Up until 2 or 3 years ago,
this college was full of delinquents.

51
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,110
Erika became counselor,
and the problems disappeared.

52
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,980
That's what concerns me.

53
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,950
She may be brilliant, but
students can't change so easily.

54
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,960
I have a feeling there's
something crooked about this.

55
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,890
Don't let your guard down
just because she's my friend.

56
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,460
I understand.

57
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,870
Erika!

58
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,330
Sara.

59
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,470
- It's been so long.
- How have you been?

60
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,310
- I've wanted to see you.
- Me too.

61
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,750
"Don't let your guard down
just because she's my friend."

62
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,990
Look who's talking.

63
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,490
Your breasts are sublime.

64
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,930
Is your boyfriend here making
them bigger every night?

65
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,500
Me? Boyfriend? What the...?

66
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,870
No way! You're wrong there.
He's just my work colleague.

67
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,880
Doesn't have to spell it out.

68
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,370
I'll show you around college.

69
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,850
And Mr. Colleague there
can come along as well.

70
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,810
Well, actually I have
to contact headquarters.

71
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,120
I see.

72
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,820
Shall we?

73
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,060
I was surprised, getting your
call out of the blue like that.

74
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,790
I was the one who was surprised.

75
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,960
You could have told me
that you were back in Japan.

76
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,660
I'm sorry. But I've been so busy...

77
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,400
Why would you give up
your practice in New York...

78
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,910
to come back to Japan
and work in a college?

79
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,400
I have my reasons.

80
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,070
Hello.

81
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,630
Everyone's so well behaved.

82
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,790
It was quite a feat to get this far.

83
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,500
So I've heard. Since you
became a counselor here...

84
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,770
academic standards have risen,
and there's no more fighting.

85
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,270
That's right. And no
need for reprimands.

86
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,910
Do you have some
special counseling method?

87
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,210
I've just applied
Professor Chang's theories.

88
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,480
Plus there are the special
lessons in this lecture hall.

89
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,380
Students who fall behind
come here after class...

90
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,150
for an additional lecture.

91
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,920
It's based on a
curriculum that I've set.

92
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,060
That's amazing.

93
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,040
It's hard to believe all
this equipment is for teaching.

94
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,800
Erika, have you considered my offer?

95
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,310
You mean, to join your
team and work together?

96
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,870
I want to make use of your talents.

97
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,510
It's a nice offer, but I can't
just abandon my students.

98
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,750
Oh, I see.

99
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,980
Sara...

100
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,930
Thanks for asking me.

101
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,800
Well, I'd better get back to my lecture.

102
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,960
See you. Let's meet again.

103
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,620
Sara...

104
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,380
Come on, Sara.

105
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,590
Tamine. How did the preparations go?

106
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,060
I've set up a hidden camera
and microphone.

107
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,750
They'll be impossible to detect.

108
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,060
Each variable is calculated
based on the mean...

109
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,270
Now, our lecture is coming to an end.

110
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,140
You must concentrate,
and listen carefully.

111
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,410
What's this?

112
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,240
A hypnosis video.

113
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,520
It suppresses the consciousness
and hypnotizes viewers.

114
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,780
It's for brainwashing!

115
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,290
Brainwashing?!

116
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,250
I'll analyze what they're
hearing in their headphones.

117
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,190
It's a pulse signal outside
the normal hearing range.

118
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,170
An ultra high frequency
that penetrates the subconscious.

119
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,850
Erika...

120
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,310
Sara...

121
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,350
Erika!

122
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:11,810
Sara...

123
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,820
Erika, stop it!
Why are you doing this?!

124
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,760
You were spying on me.

125
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,130
What you are doing here
is not psychotherapy.

126
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,430
You're turning them into robots!

127
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,270
I cannot allow you to do this!

128
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,070
What'll you do about it?

129
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,740
Inform headquarters
and have me arrested?

130
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,270
I won't let you destroy my system.

131
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,020
What are you doing?

132
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,100
What are you doing?
Stop it. No!

133
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,860
No...!

134
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,510
These students are in
a hypnotic state.

135
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,510
They will do anything I say.

136
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,640
You have nice breasts.

137
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,780
The maternal equipment for
your psychofeed therapy.

138
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,290
You were the best in
Professor Chang's seminars.

139
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,300
No matter how I tried,
I couldn't compete.

140
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:33,470
I have a psychofeed method
that's at least as good as yours.

141
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,740
I use these frequency pulses.

142
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,770
No! Stop it!

143
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,600
You should know very well, Sara...

144
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,770
the effect of a rape simulation
psychofeed session.

145
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,880
No! Stop!

146
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,120
You'll destroy who I am!

147
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,020
It's your fault.

148
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,390
Criticizing the method I
worked so hard to develop.

149
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,930
This is not counseling!

150
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,860
All you're doing is
destroying their personalities!

151
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,260
You've seen what can happen.

152
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,830
The problems with lame,
one-on-one treatments.

153
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,510
My method will stop students
dropping out because of fights.

154
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,180
It'll be a level playing field,
with no bullying.

155
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,480
Parents, teachers and employers...

156
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,820
want good students
who achieve high marks.

157
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,420
I'm just making that a reality.

158
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,620
What's wrong with that?

159
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,360
Erika, you're wrong!

160
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,100
You'll be destroyed
when you climax.

161
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,870
No!

162
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,280
The only thing that'll
remain in you is my will.

163
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,110
You must cooperate with me.

164
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,050
I want you to understand.

165
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,850
You love me, don't you?

166
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,460
Sara!

167
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,600
Sara!

168
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,310
Everything will be fine!

169
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,690
Are you alright? Hang in there.

170
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,740
Better eat something,
or you'll get sick.

171
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,740
I don't want to eat.

172
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,780
I understand how you feel, but...

173
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,980
You understand?

174
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,680
Yes.

175
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,750
Bullshit.

176
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,190
You couldn't possibly understand.

177
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,350
But I...

178
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,130
What is it you understand?

179
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,930
How could you say that?
You don't even know Erika.

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,940
There's no way you could
understand how I feel!

181
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,310
I'm sorry.

182
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,480
Sorry.

183
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,450
No.

184
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,250
I shouldn't take it out on
someone who cares for me.

185
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,810
Don't worry about it.

186
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,020
At least she thinks about
what I have to say.

187
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,450
Anyway, get some rest,
and leave Erika to me.

188
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,960
Wait, Tamine.

189
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,770
There must be something
more behind this.

190
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,930
Wait till we figure it out
before you tell headquarters.

191
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,900
But if we wait any longer,
she'll brainwash more students.

192
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,910
Please! Give me more time.

193
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,880
I understand.

194
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,060
Sara, we've got to put
a stop to that brainwashing.

195
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,960
To Professor David Chang,
Stunford University.

196
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,160
From Sara Iijima, Japan.

197
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,100
Please answer some questions
for me as soon as possible.

198
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,150
At least I can destroy
the brainwashing program.

199
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,620
That'll stop Erika Shimada
from ruining those students.

200
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,670
The gymnastics club?

201
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,650
What the...?!

202
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,290
Stop it!

203
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,290
What?

204
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,300
The baton performance!

205
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,430
Baton performance, she says!

206
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,780
And now the ropes.

207
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,810
What?

208
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,050
Nothing to be shy about.

209
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,850
Just lie back and enjoy yourself.

210
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,620
That way, I can take you
to my world of psychofeed.

211
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,620
No way!

212
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,790
Forget Sara and become my slave.

213
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,030
You'll forget your troubles
and live a life of happiness.

214
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,040
Forget about Sara?

215
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,530
I'd rather be dead!

216
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,880
How... how can you love
someone so much?

217
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,820
That can't be. In this filthy world...

218
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,290
people are selfish, and
only think of themselves.

219
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,360
That's right. People can't be trusted.

220
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,330
I'll teach you, Sara.

221
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,490
I'll show you how
people will betray you.

222
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,830
So that's it.

223
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,530
That's what happened
to Erika in New York.

224
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,880
Yes?

225
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,740
Erika?

226
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,750
I've got your stupid colleague here.

227
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,220
If you want him, meet me
at the Cosmo Institute rooftop.

228
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,690
So, Sara. Have you decided
to team up with me?

229
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,900
Professor Chang told me everything.

230
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,030
He told me what happened in America.

231
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,140
About the delinquents
you were counseling.

232
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,470
And one of them, called Alex...

233
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,780
Yes, he raped me,
and after that...

234
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,980
he committed suicide.

235
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,620
The counseling was going well.
We trusted each other.

236
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,750
He betrayed me.

237
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,250
That's when I realized it.

238
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,700
The extent to which people
cannot be trusted.

239
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,830
I also realized that in order to help
people such as Alex...

240
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,360
Professor Chang's psychofeed
theory is insufficient.

241
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,240
So you developed
your brainwashing system.

242
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,280
I could have saved
Alex with this system.

243
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,080
With this program that I created...

244
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,750
I could have saved him
by controlling his mind.

245
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,350
You're wrong!

246
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,220
You were so traumatized by Alex...

247
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,490
you became terrified of building
trusting relationships...

248
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,030
with patients on a one-on-one basis.

249
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,430
You felt you had no choice
but to arbitrarily control...

250
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,440
your students' minds.

251
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,770
That's quite a brilliant analysis.

252
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,210
Might as well find out
whether you're right.

253
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,760
Tamine!

254
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,890
This is what happened to me.

255
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,190
I bet you'll change after you've
experienced what I have.

256
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,900
No!

257
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,410
Stop!

258
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,620
How does it feel to be betrayed
by someone you trust?

259
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,050
Perhaps you can
think of a better theory.

260
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,100
Owww!

261
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,500
Were you conscious?

262
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,670
No, I just came to.

263
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,910
Cut out the act!
And get off me you pervert!

264
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,310
We're surrounded
by brainwashed students.

265
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,890
Play along with me here.

266
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,620
That's it. And soon you'll
be my loyal partner.

267
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,600
We'll see about that.

268
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,510
She's under.

269
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,690
Erika, open your heart to me.

270
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,780
Stop it, Alex!
How can you do this to me?

271
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,370
Forgive me, Erika.
I have no choice!

272
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,280
Wait, Alex! Listen to me.

273
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,520
Take me if you really want me.

274
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,150
Erika, do you mean that?

275
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,260
Of course. I believe in you.

276
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,200
If you honestly want me,
I'll give you everything.

277
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,760
Erika.

278
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,540
I'm sorry!

279
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,310
Alex!

280
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,730
I was powerless.

281
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,460
I thought we'd built
a trusting relationship.

282
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,560
I thought I could save him.

283
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,040
But it was all an illusion.

284
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,970
I'm so sorry, Alex.

285
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,570
If only I'd been a better counselor...

286
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,280
I wouldn't have led you
to commit suicide.

287
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,840
He didn't kill himself.

288
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,050
You should know that.

289
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,090
His murderer was caught.

290
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,290
But you blame yourself for his death.

291
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,660
You denied the truth.

292
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,660
What're you doing?

293
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,060
I'm going to make you see the truth.

294
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,340
Alex was going out on his own...

295
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,040
but he ran into his gang
and they threatened him.

296
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,650
Said they'd kill him
if he quit the gang.

297
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,880
He was told to rape you,
to prove his loyalty to them.

298
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,480
But they caught him running away.

299
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,790
They killed him and made
it look like a suicide.

300
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,000
So it's the same as my killing him!

301
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,590
- It's my fault!
- Listen to me!

302
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,200
You did the right thing!

303
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,300
However terrible the ending...

304
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,810
Alex was bound to
his life on the streets.

305
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,710
But after he met you, he
decided to leave the streets.

306
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,480
He was determined to
start his life over.

307
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,040
That doesn't change the
fact that it's my fault.

308
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,490
Erika.

309
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,490
Alex.

310
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,550
Erika. We finally meet again.

311
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,660
Thank you, Erika.

312
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,200
I've wanted to thank you for so long.

313
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,730
You believed me in my time of need.

314
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,310
It was the first time
I ever felt truly happy.

315
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,550
Alex...

316
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,470
Erika, listen to the
rest of my analysis.

317
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,160
You suffered from
a traumatic experience.

318
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,570
But you didn't abandon
your profession.

319
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,950
And you tried desperately
to recreate him.

320
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,480
But I was wrong.

321
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,840
Your method was wrong.

322
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,720
But I'm glad.

323
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,160
I respect you for your
kindness and diligence.

324
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:50,920
Sara...

325
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,130
Don't worry. It's not too
late to start over again.

326
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,080
Thanks to your help...

327
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,130
the students were
successfully de-programmed.

328
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,420
That's great.

329
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,430
It's important to see
things through to the end.

330
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,770
Give my regards to Dr. Chang.

331
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,860
Take care.

332
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,400
Sara...

333
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,940
Erika!

334
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,710
I envy your having someone
you trust so close by.

335
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,380
Well...

336
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,650
Don't push yourself too hard, Sara.

337
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,380
Mr. Colleague, Take care of this lady.

338
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,780
With all my life.

339
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,660
With all your life?

340
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,790
Take care. Bye.

341
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,270
The lesson is over.

342
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,480
There she goes.

343
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,380
Listen, Sara.

344
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,080
I have my own theory about Erika.

345
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,620
Could you hear me out?

346
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,180
Sure. What is it?

347
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,520
I've been thinking about
Erika losing confidence...

348
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,760
and coming back to
Japan from New York.

349
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,600
I think maybe she wanted
to be closer to you...

350
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,970
since you got along so
well when you were students.

351
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,870
Perhaps all along she was hoping...

352
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,970
that you would come to her rescue.

353
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,180
You're going overboard.

354
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,650
First of all, I'm just a novice.

355
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,550
I'm not so good that people
can depend on my help.

356
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,220
Yeah, right.

357
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,390
Pretty humble, considering
you're a psychologist.

358
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,590
You don't even understand
the feelings of your colleague.

359
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,060
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

360
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,600
Just forget it. It's nothing.

361
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,670
Tamine here... I see.

362
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,870
Another project?

363
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,410
Right. Let's get on it.

364
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,310
Of course.

365
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,470
Like lovers!

366
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,740
What are you talking about?!
