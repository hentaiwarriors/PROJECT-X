1
00:00:01,048 --> 00:00:05,382
I'm sorry to have asked you out
this late, Mr. Oasa.

2
00:00:05,852 --> 00:00:09,913
No, no, when the Main Family
summons me, time is of no issue.

3
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:12,817
What can I do for you?

4
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:14,792
Well.

5
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,891
I'm so hot tonight,
I can't go to sleep.

6
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:24,267
I wonder why...

7
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:28,070
Well. That's beyond me...

8
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:35,443
Miss Kaori...

9
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:39,313
Whatever you are planning to do
with Aunt Himiko...

10
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:41,354
...I want to know all the details.

11
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:44,385
But I'm sure...

12
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:48,019
...you won't honestly tell me what I
want to know.

13
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,229
I really can't...

14
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:59,597
So I borrowed the spider
from Akira and...

15
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:02,938
...played a little trick on you.

16
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:07,936
Now you will tell me
everything you know.

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,184
Do you still have some power left?

18
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:34,070
You don't know when to quit.

19
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:40,980
Descent Third King!

20
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:06,862
Stop it!

21
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:25,056
No, not there.

22
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:30,292
No! Stop it!

23
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:37,359
Well, well, you were
so much trouble.

24
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:41,867
But you will be very obedient
from now on.

25
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:35,510
Inma Seiden

26
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:45,030
So, Moeka, how is Mao doing?

27
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,793
She won't even answer me
when I talk to her.

28
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,837
She is always looking down
during class.

29
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:55,306
Miss Mao doesn't even show up
to the club these days.

30
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,843
Could it be the Iron Mask's doing?

31
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:01,369
Ayano, you shouldn't make
ridiculous jokes out of something like this.

32
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:05,782
Think about it, though.
Strange things have been happening...

33
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:08,586
...ever since people started talking
about the Iron Mask.

34
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:12,989
Teachers quit all of the sudden,
girls transfer out to other schools.

35
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:17,689
A girl named Reiko Koga recently
disappeared from the Academy as well.

36
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:21,063
I still haven't told you about
how Sena disappeared.

37
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,298
What troublesome girls!

38
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:28,503
Cutting classes and doing whatever
pleases them.

39
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:31,873
How is your arm healing, Akira?

40
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,537
I am fine.

41
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:37,340
But the fact that I could not protect
My Lady is...

42
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,978
Akira! Please make sure not
to act too hastily.

43
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,316
I just hope those girls...

44
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,553
...and their activities
don't interfere with my plans.

45
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:50,093
I see. A God took Miss Yamamoto.

46
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:53,564
Then when Sena was kidnapped by
the Iron Mask and disappeared...

47
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:56,830
...I thought she had transferred to
another school, but...

48
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:59,838
...if there is someone who hurt
Mao and Sena, I won't forgive him!

49
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:03,433
I will find out the perpetrator,
on my own, if necessary!

50
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:08,180
I will help you. I'm worried
about Miss Mao.

51
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:17,786
Why does Kaori
ignore Himiko's activities?

52
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:21,150
What would happen to the
world if the calamity increases?

53
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,789
How is the investigation into
Ohtori Academy coming along?

54
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:28,356
Our usual special assignment
teachers may be not up to this!

55
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:34,001
On that regard, I have already
sent in my agent, Melanie Cool.

56
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:43,580
Come on, Kao, come down.

57
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:46,911
Tell me if something's happened.

58
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:49,648
We're best friends, aren't we?

59
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:53,887
We are all waiting for you in the
club. Please come.

60
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:09,741
I can't even begin to figure out
Minako's whereabouts.

61
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:13,540
How can I report this to the Main
Temple Headquarters?

62
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,847
Why not take up on Himiko's offer?

63
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:35,533
For someone like you to want to
investigate Her Highness Himiko.

64
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:37,194
Who is it?

65
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:44,799
My name is Takashi Shimura.

66
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:48,539
I'm here because Her Highness
Himiko demands you.

67
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:53,151
Come, Militant Chari King!

68
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:02,523
No!

69
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:09,397
Mr. Yashagami!

70
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,127
Mao.

71
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:21,909
What's going on?
Something's wrong.

72
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:28,110
Stop hiding like a rat
and come out!

73
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:38,453
Why does Mao always hang out
with nosy people like you?

74
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:42,729
Wait! Miss Kameyama, do you
know what happened to Mao?

75
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:47,033
None of your business.

76
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:50,542
I'm Mao's best friend.
I have the right to know.

77
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:56,879
Mao is not very stable right now,
so don't bother her, okay?

78
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,975
What's wrong with me worrying
about Mao?

79
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:03,415
I'll tell you this!

80
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:06,788
You are free to do whatever you
want, but get involved in this...

81
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,794
...and you might lose your life.

82
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:11,023
What? Why?

83
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,863
What do you mean by that?

84
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:18,332
I mean that Miss Hitomi
knows something.

85
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:21,438
Why don't you just
ask Miss Mao yourself?

86
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,777
Mao doesn't really answer me,
even when I talk to her.

87
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:28,038
Besides...

88
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:29,604
Besides?

89
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:34,748
Well, Mao looks very friendly
with Mr. Yashagami.

90
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,022
Mr. Yashagami is staying with the
Ohtori Main Family, isn't he?

91
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:47,257
Then it's no wonder she worries
about Mao all the time.

92
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,461
Yeah. That's true.

93
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,006
So, please do your best, Moeka.

94
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:56,638
I shall talk to Mao again tomorrow.

95
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:07,952
This is too much for a joke.

96
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:12,080
It was just like this when we were
attacked the last time.

97
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:16,016
Whoever it is, we don't have to
go look for him.

98
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:21,166
Inward Bound Fist!

99
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:33,740
Come on out, you coward!
Who the hell are you?

100
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:35,814
Moeka, watch out!

101
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:41,517
Be careful, this prayer summons...

102
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:44,112
Whatever comes, I'll fight it!

103
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:53,996
Outward Bound Fist!

104
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,967
Let go of Moeka!

105
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:06,503
No! Help me, Mao!

106
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,108
How dare you interfere with us?

107
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:16,246
I shall take my time tormenting you.

108
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:39,800
Moeka!

109
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:43,305
Are you all right?

110
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:51,287
Miss Ayano, Suzune.

111
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:56,321
Miss Moeka.

112
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:58,996
You, juvenile delinquents!

113
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:04,296
You amateurs are no match
for that one!

114
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,031
Who are you?

115
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:11,002
Stay away from trouble,
and go on home.

116
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:18,309
Stop worrying.
Don't call me anymore.

117
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:22,077
I told you, it's not your fault.

118
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,114
Don't worry.

119
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:27,291
I have to get up early tomorrow,
so I should go now.

120
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:41,063
You act like you hate her,
but you worry a lot about Mao.

121
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:45,003
Either way,
when you were attacked...

122
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:48,514
...it was I who saved you.
Don't worry about it.

123
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:02,027
What do you mean by this?
For the School Chairperson to do this...

124
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,061
Saeko, you look nice when you're
trying to act tough.

125
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,202
You could very easily
take over Minako's job.

126
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,171
Minako? You mean Minako
was here, too?

127
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,937
Rikako. Rikako.

128
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,942
My dear Saeko, now that
we've become friends...

129
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:26,109
...l'll reveal to you my intentions.

130
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:36,455
Something horrible is going to
happen, isn't it, Bodai?

131
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,394
Aren't you going to help her?

132
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:41,729
No way. That would spoil
all the fun.

133
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:45,930
No way. If you repositioned
Mt. Shumi...

134
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:48,974
...that would turn the Earth's
rotational axis upside down.

135
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,745
I sure will miss you, Saeko.

136
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:57,977
I might not see you again,
while you have your sanity.

137
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,575
Rikako. Rikako.

138
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,481
No! Open it! Please!

139
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:06,891
Rikako.

140
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:26,133
Mao...

141
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,175
I've been looking
all over for you, Mao.

142
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:36,619
Miss Matsumoto was transferred
to another school!

143
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:40,455
Just like Miss Yamato was.
Something strange is going on!

144
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:43,058
What's it got to do with me?

145
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:47,765
Miss Mao! Miss Ayano and I
are investigating the weird incidents...

146
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,393
...happening around
this Academy.

147
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:53,666
You will help us, right?

148
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:56,467
You must have a lot of time
on your hands.

149
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:59,674
Why don't you work this hard
in your clubs?

150
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:03,908
Mao, why?

151
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:06,281
Why have you changed so much?

152
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:09,412
What happened to the old,
cheerful Mao?

153
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:16,894
Miss Mao, Miss Moeka
is really worried about you.

154
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:22,297
Please say something.
We were attacked last night...

155
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:25,201
...and Moeka was captured
by a monster...

156
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,262
Moeka and a monster?

157
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:36,880
Sorry. Leave me alone for now.

158
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:39,776
Miss Mao!

159
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:44,755
What are the three friends
plotting over here?

160
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:46,787
Mr. Yashagami.

161
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:50,588
Miss Ohtori, your sister is waiting
for you in the Student Organization Room.

162
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:52,426
My sister?

163
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:54,897
Suzune, I'll see you later, at the club.

164
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,366
Okay.

165
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:09,105
So, we don't know
who used that God?

166
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:11,880
I was attacked so suddenly.

167
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:14,719
All I know is it was a woman.

168
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:16,715
A woman.

169
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:20,721
You're lying! How could
Aunt Himiko be...?

170
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:24,229
It's true. You've been aware of it,
haven't you?

171
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:28,633
I should have told you
a long time ago.

172
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:32,565
Hitomi saved my life.

173
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,673
It was too bad
what happened to Sena.

174
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:39,643
Stop it! I don't want to hear this!

175
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:42,408
Miss Kaori, please stop. No more.

176
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,314
Mao, it is our duty to respect our
mother, Rikako's will and...

177
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:50,617
...protect the Ohtori Family.

178
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:54,151
The Kameyama Family is trying
to take over our family.

179
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,227
There are only two of us left of the
pure bloodline of the Ohtori Family.

180
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,633
Aunt Himiko intends to sacrifice
more Academy students...

181
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:04,795
...to the Chaki Nan God.

182
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:09,007
You know what that means, do you?

183
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:16,476
Good girl. For now,
just follow my instructions.

184
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,049
Suzune is waiting for me.
I'm going to the club.

185
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:31,429
Miss Mao.

186
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:34,796
Are you girls still playing this
detective game?

187
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:38,132
I just want to find out what's
happening at this Academy.

188
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:41,765
What's happening to my friends
and schoolmates...

189
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:43,568
Come on over.

190
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:48,479
Suzune, do you know
what you are involved in?

191
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:50,611
I knew something was going on.

192
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:53,584
You knew it,
but you kept it from me.

193
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:59,857
Talk to Moeka and Miss Ozawa,
and wash your hands of the whole ordeal!

194
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:03,553
No! I hate it when you act
unilaterally like this!

195
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:04,994
Suzune!

196
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:09,434
Suzune. I've been telling
you not to...

197
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:18,975
What does Miss Kaori intend to do
with My Lady?

198
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:22,841
I've always known Himiko and
Hitomi would have to be eliminated...

199
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:26,078
...if they keep on tormenting
My Lady, but now...

200
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:30,180
...if Miss Kaori is not going to be
there for My Lady...

201
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:32,520
...I will have to defeat her, too.

202
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,950
Come in.

203
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:39,860
Miss Toyoda!
What can I do for you?

204
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,031
Are you in love with someone?

205
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,836
What? No, nobody in particular.

206
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,613
What about Mao?
What about her?

207
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:57,114
My Lady is...

208
00:18:57,183 --> 00:19:00,209
I love you, Mr. Yashagami.

209
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:04,184
Miss Toyoda, if this is a personal
matter, please come back later.

210
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:07,521
I appreciate it, but I am busy now.

211
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:42,186
Please, Mr. Yashagami,
make love to me.

212
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:46,130
Stop being so irrational.

213
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:48,857
So you do love Mao, don't you?

214
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:55,133
It's just I've been watching after
My Lady since she was a child.

215
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:58,142
Please do not misunderstand.
All right?

216
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,518
Miss Mao does know something.

217
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,914
I will expose the truth,
no matter what.

218
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:14,349
Who are you?

219
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,691
For Her Highness Himiko's sake,
I will examine your body.

220
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:20,629
The chairwoman?

221
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:25,834
No!

222
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:31,536
Stay away!

223
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,146
No, stop! No!

224
00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:48,850
No, stop it!

225
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:57,560
So, do you like it?

226
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:03,202
I'll make you feel even better.

227
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:12,650
No. Stop it. Stop it!

228
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:29,359
You shouldn't get so involved
in someone else's business.

229
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:32,871
It's none of my business
whatever Takashi does.

230
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:37,468
Good. Just think about the time
I made love to you.

231
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:38,908
Ouch!

232
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:42,340
I hope Mao suffers more.

233
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:51,753
No.

234
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:54,420
You're so wet now.

235
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:56,586
Who's saying, "No"?

236
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:03,833
It feels good.

237
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:07,099
I love the noises you make.

238
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:09,766
You can't control yourself,
can you?

239
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:12,276
I will make this easy for you.

240
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,679
It hurts! It hurts.

241
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:27,021
Bear with me, soon it'll
feel very good.

242
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:32,063
No, you're ripping me.

243
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:34,857
It hurts.

244
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:39,163
What's wrong? Your ass is
pushing back against me!

245
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:42,164
I can't.

246
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:44,266
Everything's becoming different.

247
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:49,808
It feels so good.

248
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:22,035
I knew it.

249
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:35,592
I see. That is
very worrisome, Moeka.

250
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:43,001
But Mao says she doesn't want to
get involved with others. I'm sorry.

251
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:44,660
Wait a minute.

252
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:48,867
Suzune has disappeared.
Mao would be worried about her, too.

253
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:50,966
Please, give me Mao.

254
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:52,874
Please let me talk to Mao.

255
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:58,980
Mao is, as you know, straight-laced.
Please understand, she'll be upset with me.

256
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:02,551
What about Suzune?
What would happen to Suzune?

257
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:08,059
Don't worry about Suzune.
She'll be back in school tomorrow.

258
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:11,687
You're so much trouble.

259
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:15,666
Where could Suzune be?
That reminds me.

260
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:19,830
There was a strange Spirit rising
from the Kichijo Heaven Temple.

261
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:21,930
But whether it has
to do with Suzune...

262
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,406
...I highly doubt.

263
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:25,807
The Kichijo Heaven Temple?

264
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,575
How hasty she is.

265
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:30,576
Sis!

266
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:32,616
Oh, Moe, how long
have you been there?

267
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:35,983
Who called?
What happened to Suzune?

268
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:39,688
Don't you worry. Have a nap.

269
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:43,717
You said the Kichijo Heaven Temple.
Is that where Suzune is?

270
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:45,290
She's so much trouble.

271
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:48,299
She's still too naive to inherit the
Ohtori Family.

272
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,767
Is that okay? To let her go?

273
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:53,828
It's too late for her anyway.

274
00:24:58,043 --> 00:25:01,444
Well well, your sister will learn
to hate you soon.

275
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:26,295
Three now.

276
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:29,573
Halfway through.

277
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:32,140
Suzune, Suzune!

278
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:33,578
Suzune!

279
00:25:34,112 --> 00:25:37,570
Suzune, what happened
to you? Suzune!

280
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,145
- Suzune.
- Suzune!

281
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:43,279
Stay away! Don't go near Suzune!

282
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:45,281
Moeka...

283
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:48,856
Mao, you're not our friend
any more!

284
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,765
I heard Miss Saeko was transferred
to another school.

285
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:02,769
- Tsk! I so wanted her!
- Idiot, you never had a chance.

286
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:06,405
They said Suzune also transferred
to another school.

287
00:26:12,384 --> 00:26:13,851
Rise!

288
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:28,022
I'm Melanie Cool.
I'll be teaching your health class.

289
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:30,332
How do you do?
