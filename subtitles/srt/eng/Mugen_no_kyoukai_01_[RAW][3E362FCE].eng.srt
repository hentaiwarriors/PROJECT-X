1
00:00:01,061 --> 00:00:12,131
The dream world

2
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,874
Mr. Awudalupu.

3
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:28,951
Who is it?

4
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:31,354
Whose voice is it?

5
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:37,356
Mr. Awudalupu.

6
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:43,467
Please love me...

7
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:47,436
Awudalupu.

8
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:50,644
No. That is not my name.

9
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,742
I am...

10
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:04,791
Please give me more love...

11
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:07,693
Please give me love...

12
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:17,799
Again...

13
00:01:19,073 --> 00:01:22,099
Love more deeply...

14
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:26,344
Awudalupu...

15
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:29,574
Awudalupu...

16
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:31,947
Awudalupu...

17
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:32,745
No...

18
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:35,418
I am not Awudalupu.

19
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:38,848
I am...

20
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,826
No... fool...

21
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:46,897
It is the dream.

22
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:54,698
I have this dream because keeping seeing this.

23
00:01:56,343 --> 00:01:59,039
No... the fool...

24
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:08,248
But anyway, I can sleep more.

25
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:15,823
Chenwu.

26
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:19,222
When do you want to sleep until?

27
00:02:22,603 --> 00:02:24,127
What are you doing, grandfather Wu...

28
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,069
Chenwu.

29
00:02:26,206 --> 00:02:30,267
If I am the enemy, you will be dead by now.

30
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:32,777
I said...

31
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:36,144
I don't want to have the life
being attacked at sleep like grandpa.

32
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:55,027
I said.

33
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:58,696
Why did someone want to get your life,
the chairman of karate club?

34
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:00,067
Need to say anymore.

35
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:04,268
I will say this because
I want to have more alert sense.

36
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:06,879
What are you talking about?

37
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:10,981
Damn... fool...

38
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:14,811
Damn.

39
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:18,620
Damn... fool...

40
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:26,630
Chenwu.

41
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:31,204
38.

42
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,073
39.

43
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:38,403
40.

44
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:43,976
41.
Take a look at yourself. What?

45
00:03:44,117 --> 00:03:45,846
Your wrist strenght is off.

46
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:48,885
You need to practice more.

47
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:51,749
44.

48
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:57,195
What are you jokking about?
I have some other things to do.

49
00:03:59,032 --> 00:03:59,794
51.

50
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:02,994
52.

51
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,131
53.

52
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:09,770
54.

53
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:13,173
55...

54
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:18,874
94.

55
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,512
95.

56
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:24,189
96.

57
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:26,884
Good morning.

58
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:29,117
Lian, good morning.

59
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:30,628
It is about time.

60
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:32,622
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,758
I promised him to study
at school earlier today.

62
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:38,633
What?

63
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:42,539
Yes... yes...
We promised each other.

64
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:47,236
Damn.
No choice. Four more and go.

65
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:54,148
97, 98, 99, 100.

66
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,021
Lian, thanks for saving me.

67
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,421
If you don't save me.

68
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:03,086
Not sure when I have to have
this training unitl.

69
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:06,431
What are you talking about?

70
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,797
We do have the appointment.

71
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:09,630
Do you forget?

72
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:11,265
I forgot.

73
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:15,432
Damn... almost the test time.

74
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:17,476
Not my business if you have the bad grade.

75
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:19,238
This...

76
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:19,811
Lian.

77
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:20,936
Mr. Lian.

78
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:22,275
Lian lord.

79
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,849
I rely on you.

80
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:27,449
Who cared about you?

81
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:28,480
What are you talking about?

82
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,588
You always rely on me.

83
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:34,216
Always like that.
It is not for the sake of you, Chenwu.

84
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:36,324
What?

85
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:39,455
Weren't we born on the same hospital?
We are the friends by ten minutes apart?

86
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:41,562
Who cared?

87
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:46,027
Grandpa wanted you to take over it.

88
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,003
They are different.

89
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:48,130
This guy.

90
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,436
A cold person.

91
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:56,607
It is no good.
You two, don't fight.

92
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:05,090
As long as we fight, the war can't be stopped.

93
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,184
Mai.

94
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,885
No... not like the way you think.

95
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:12,430
This is the love we try to show.

96
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:13,498
Yes, Lian.

97
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,057
No comment.

98
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,335
You see... they both have the good relationship.

99
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:21,907
Yes...

100
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:28,308
No matter what, Lian is like a brother to me.

101
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:30,376
No comment.

102
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:34,385
Lian, you don't need this kind of
brother to take care of you.

103
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,112
What are you talking about?

104
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:39,817
Sonya, you.
What are you talking about?

105
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,086
That is what I try to say.

106
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:47,066
Hard to stand when he was born
earlier by ten minutes.

107
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:53,499
He only knew Karate but not good at study.

108
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,574
Sorry... tom girl...

109
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:59,509
What are you talking about?
You kept bringing up something I cared.

110
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:02,137
Ok...

111
00:07:02,616 --> 00:07:03,480
Chenwu.

112
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:07,053
At elementary school,
Sonya won by one point for the race.

113
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:08,916
Did she still remember it?

114
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:10,751
That kind of thing...

115
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:11,755
How could it be?

116
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:14,750
It must be like that.

117
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:19,525
It is long time ago.
I am better now.

118
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:23,033
Of course.
You are the man.

119
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,298
Something like this from you.
Hard to believe you are a girl.

120
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,135
Learn from Mai.

121
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:30,641
So sorry.

122
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:36,147
Ok... you two, don't fight.

123
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,250
Mai, why did you come to school?

124
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:48,021
No, from today I have a part time at this time.

125
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:50,959
I remember you work at the tea house
called Coffee Break, right.

126
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:54,595
Sister, isn't that shop opposite from that school?

127
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:59,297
I feel it is lonely to separate from everyone.

128
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,135
Yes, it must be lonely.

129
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:03,640
What? Chenwu.

130
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:06,769
You like sister so you agree with her.

131
00:08:06,913 --> 00:08:10,041
Anything wrong?

132
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:14,711
Damn, I like Chenwu too.

133
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:16,379
Really?

134
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:19,822
Yes. I like Lian and Sonya.

135
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:24,856
And the pet, Pote with Mike at section three.

136
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:28,229
I like the frog, Kolo the most.

137
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:38,109
Onch, you...

138
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:41,940
Fight along the river.

139
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,175
The old trick.

140
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:49,512
But the item that the captain
had was out of date.

141
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:50,947
So noisy.

142
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:54,356
From the past,
fighting should be along the river?

143
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:56,555
Up to you.

144
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:59,460
You never won over me up to now?

145
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:02,295
I won over you for 48 times.

146
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:06,838
So noisy.
You can't be so boast more.

147
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:09,806
I have heard for 48 times.

148
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:13,242
Wait, you two stop.

149
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,042
Mai, say something.

150
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:18,583
Don't you say no more fighting?

151
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:21,186
Don't stop me, Mai.

152
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:23,619
This is about men.

153
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:25,819
Damn...

154
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,951
Hard to stop them.

155
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:30,392
Sister.

156
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,464
Damn, lian.

157
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:38,462
Chenwu never stopped what he wanted to do.

158
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:39,764
Damn.

159
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:41,737
Check this out.

160
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,466
Come on.

161
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:47,639
A must hit trick. So good.

162
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:50,777
Whoever moves first loses the game.

163
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:02,386
No.

164
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,392
I hate it.

165
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:18,939
A possibility.

166
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:20,342
No good.

167
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:28,386
It hurt... hard to handle.

168
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:32,823
This is the failure in my life.

169
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,449
I was defeated.

170
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:37,620
But on the other hand.

171
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:45,434
Your underwear matched well
with your appearance.

172
00:10:45,572 --> 00:10:48,302
And the belt.

173
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:49,465
Some attraction as an adult.

174
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:54,570
It is shocked for Sonya to wear
this woman like underwear.

175
00:10:58,218 --> 00:10:59,480
It hurt...

176
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:04,352
Compared with the wound,
the flap from Sonya is more powerful.

177
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:08,827
Damn, Chenwu,
you are a fool and sicko.

178
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:13,560
I will die if
I don't go to the hospital.

179
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:15,263
White.

180
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:22,600
Danger.

181
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:39,253
What happened...

182
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,984
Why is it a dream?

183
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:43,086
What is this?

184
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:50,102
Didn't I go to the heaven?

185
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:53,762
This is...

186
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:03,808
No...

187
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:10,281
Forgive me.

188
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:28,364
No... I can't...

189
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:30,269
What is this?

190
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:39,710
What is going on?

191
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:56,767
I can't...

192
00:12:58,505 --> 00:12:59,904
About to go.

193
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:36,100
Don't come here.

194
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,206
Awudalupu.

195
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:41,980
Are you ok? Awudalupu.

196
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:47,048
Awudalupu.

197
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:48,883
Did you call me?

198
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:51,887
I...

199
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:55,056
Yes, I am Awudalupu.

200
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:57,592
I am the fairy to protect
this fairy world.

201
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:00,490
Awudalupu, did you sleep?

202
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:07,162
Awudalupu, how is the battle?

203
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,139
No...

204
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:13,678
Because a hole on the side is open,
the nightmare keeps coming.

205
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:18,350
Everyone does his best
to hold on to it.

206
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:29,152
I handle here.
You go the the forest of ring.

207
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:31,930
The forest of ring.

208
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,428
He is Muna from the beast tribe?

209
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:37,801
Dalo attacked.

210
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:41,906
No way to leave you behind.

211
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:42,803
Leave me alone, hurry.

212
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,371
I can't see the way I am.
I may kill you by a chance.

213
00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:50,044
Lawulubalu.

214
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:53,177
I know.

215
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:04,593
No, don't come here.

216
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:23,844
No.

217
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,647
No, stop.

218
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:34,979
Help.

219
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:37,080
Father, help.

220
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:40,051
Awudalupu.

221
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:52,566
Awudalupu.

222
00:17:13,593 --> 00:17:15,220
Awudalupu.

223
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:17,556
Sorry, I am late.

224
00:17:17,697 --> 00:17:21,224
No. I am happy you can save me.

225
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:25,136
Not a big deal with such a small cut.

226
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:28,496
It is no good
if infected by the virus.

227
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:31,641
So itch.

228
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:36,137
It is ok. Let me handle it.

229
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:47,784
It is ok. Let me handle it.

230
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:01,802
Any feeling? I am happy.

231
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:07,510
Why did you do such a thing?

232
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:12,417
Father let me handle you?
Awudalupu.

233
00:18:13,753 --> 00:18:18,417
What?
Muna's father, Winsarao.

234
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:25,890
I am dying.

235
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:28,696
Lion king, Winsarao.

236
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:31,932
Death is another ritual for rebirth.

237
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:33,470
I am not afraid of death.

238
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:39,034
But I am worried
about my daughter, Muna.

239
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:44,081
Because the borderline is weaker
and more creatures.

240
00:18:44,217 --> 00:18:47,050
You have to be the leader
of beast tribe.

241
00:18:48,187 --> 00:18:49,449
Don't worry.

242
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:50,521
I will take care of her.

243
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:54,257
Thank you. You let her feel happy.

244
00:18:55,128 --> 00:18:57,756
What I meant was...

245
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:00,625
You will face so many enemies.

246
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:04,726
Nothing to worry about
if the couple gets together.

247
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:05,867
So I said...

248
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:08,337
That is.

249
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:16,809
You have feeling for me.

250
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:18,945
I am so happy.

251
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:22,182
Muna, about this...

252
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:28,119
I fall in love to you
at the beginning.

253
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:47,842
From the beginning,
I want to give you my first time.

254
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:57,820
The tough had sticking feeling.

255
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,196
Awudalupu.

256
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:45,496
I... had...

257
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,923
No...

258
00:21:27,146 --> 00:21:28,113
Are you ok?

259
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:32,941
My body had a big...

260
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:35,320
Awudalupu has a big dick.

261
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,483
Shaking inside of my body.

262
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:41,654
It became so big.
That is the proof for my love.

263
00:21:42,862 --> 00:21:45,854
I can feel it...

264
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:49,928
Something good is inside of my body.

265
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:52,033
I am moving.

266
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:57,242
Be gentle.

267
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:40,708
I am cumming.

268
00:22:41,253 --> 00:22:42,720
Cumming.

269
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:45,114
Cumming.

270
00:22:46,892 --> 00:22:48,723
No.

271
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:17,213
A dream again...

272
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:21,818
Yes.

273
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:24,524
I was hit by a truck.

274
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:25,956
And then...

275
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:29,092
And then what?

276
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,799
It seemed not to get hurt.

277
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:37,832
Where is this place?

278
00:23:48,154 --> 00:23:50,520
No. This... this...

279
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:12,468
Too good.

280
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:14,343
Chenwu.

281
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:22,453
You fool...

282
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:41,612
Chenwu.

283
00:29:41,841 --> 00:29:45,971
Your waist shakes so well.
Your pussy is wet.

284
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:52,581
Look. The expression is good.

285
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:56,816
Look. Madam.

286
00:29:58,024 --> 00:30:00,788
Have a date with your husband alone?

287
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:03,162
Don't be this way.

288
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:07,099
You don't want
your husband to see this photo?

289
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:10,136
Madam.

290
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,534
I am almost there.

291
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:28,144
How can you be so reasonable
when you are a bitch in heat?

292
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:35,160
So horny.

293
00:30:44,797 --> 00:30:47,288
It is definitely different from
the girls in the class.

294
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,562
Fool, of course it is different.

295
00:31:15,294 --> 00:31:18,024
No voice, sister.

296
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:21,562
It is not good to hear the voice
of female in men's room.

297
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:30,108
So wet.

298
00:31:35,948 --> 00:31:37,575
So wet.

299
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:40,185
Sister, you got excited so easy.

300
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:48,420
You can feel more in this place.

301
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:51,462
It is coming out, sister.
