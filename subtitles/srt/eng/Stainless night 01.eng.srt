1
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,162
Misuzu!

2
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:30,200
Why did we come here in this old car?

3
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,699
An old car is perfect
for this environment.

4
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:39,405
It's rough and full of character,
 unlike the car I always drive.

5
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:42,317
We should always get
this kind of stimulation.

6
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:47,886
Sometimes you're very old-fashioned,
although you're the head of Roboken.

7
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,217
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,495
W-What are you doing?

9
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:59,130
Where would you be if you couldn't
borrow the old-fashioned girl's note book?

10
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:02,205
I'm sorry.

11
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:07,605
I was able to hand in my final paper and have a summer break with everybody...

12
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:10,377
...all because of you.

13
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:12,907
It's okay...

14
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:15,008
I expect a reward later.

15
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:42,404
Why are we the only two?

16
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:48,881
I asked if you would like to go to the
Institute of Nature's protection area with me.

17
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:53,081
You didn't say we
would be the only two.

18
00:03:57,994 --> 00:04:00,554
We haven't done it for a while.

19
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:03,989
I want to smell you.

20
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:11,139
This is all because of you...

21
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:15,511
Y-You planed this from
the beginning, didn't you?

22
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:59,052
You smell good...

23
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,189
You are lovely, Sayaka...

24
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:09,188
When I couldn't see you,
I touched myself everyday.

25
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,568
And I always thought
of when we made love.

26
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:15,401
Again and again...

27
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:16,900
M-Misuzu...

28
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:22,098
Oh, Misuzu!

29
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,372
It's a little early but
it's okay, you can come.

30
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,212
I found you!

31
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:45,585
Misuzu, what are you doing?

32
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:48,225
A-Aki...

33
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:57,272
You're mean!

34
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,672
You disappeared
without saying anything to me.

35
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:05,915
You weren't in the Roboken office,
and the library was closed because...

36
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:07,505
...they were reorganizing.

37
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:10,780
I thought I couldn't see
you until next semester.

38
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:14,219
I felt so sad, and I cried.

39
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:20,656
But, my sad heart reached God.

40
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:23,324
I was in front of the main auditorium...

41
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:27,767
...when Maiko came and
told me what you said earlier...

42
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:32,899
...about the school Institute
Custodian having a summer vacation, too.

43
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:34,375
She didn't...

44
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:42,444
Misuzu, Aki, I'll go and cook.

45
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:44,986
I'll help you.

46
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:46,683
No way!

47
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:50,052
You have to be with me.

48
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:52,017
Don't cheat on me.

49
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:53,187
Excuse me!

50
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,628
Lui, come on!

51
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:56,221
Don't go, please, Sayaka!

52
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:58,096
Get your hands off!

53
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,896
I said, no!

54
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,137
Sayaka!

55
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:07,573
Misuzu, say ''Ahh.''

56
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,268
N-No, thank you.

57
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:34,694
Where are you going?

58
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:09,100
What happened?

59
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:14,941
Is there anything outside?

60
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:18,973
Just a moment, I'll open the door.

61
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:23,950
Oh, hey! Lui!

62
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:30,619
Oh no, it's too dark to see anything.

63
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:35,926
I guess I should go see...

64
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:45,074
Lui, what's going on?

65
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:52,809
M-My goodness...

66
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:54,941
Is she dead?

67
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:59,011
E-Excuse me?

68
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:11,823
Is it an Android?

69
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:18,635
What should I do?

70
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:30,241
No!

71
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:52,270
Stop it!

72
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:54,734
She's awake.

73
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:56,676
You mean it's functioning, right?

74
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:04,344
Please, don't be scared.

75
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,019
We're not from the Inspection Bureau.

76
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:11,716
I'm Sayaka and she is Misuzu.

77
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:14,226
Why were you in such a place?

78
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:16,328
Did you do something wrong?

79
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:19,558
Or did you run away from your owner?

80
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,005
Good morning.

81
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:30,669
Misuzu, who is that woman?

82
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,408
She is an android.

83
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,609
Oh, an Android?

84
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:37,442
Isn't she a lost-roid?

85
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:42,084
Seriously, why did you pass out there?

86
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:46,726
I don't know anything...

87
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:49,821
I lost my memory.

88
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,694
Then, you don't even
remember your name?

89
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,437
Yes, I do remember my name.

90
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:01,536
I'm Linia.

91
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:11,213
What, a Black Broker?

92
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:17,424
Yes, it's an organization that
distributes unidentified and illegal androids.

93
00:12:18,194 --> 00:12:21,186
I've heard they illegally
remodel those androids.

94
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:24,398
Do you think she escaped from there?

95
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:26,500
It's possible.

96
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:30,265
I don't think it's easy to
make such an elaborate android.

97
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:34,607
And, it's strange that she doesn't
remember anything except her name.

98
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:38,813
If it's true, don't you need
to call the Inspection Bureau?

99
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:43,444
We don't get that many
chances to inspect androids like her.

100
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:45,851
I want to examine her.

101
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:50,916
Linia, are you all set?

102
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:00,863
Well, do you feel refreshed?

103
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:04,205
Thank you so much.

104
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:05,674
You're welcome.

105
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:09,705
You don't have any
model or registration number.

106
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:16,243
You may be custom-made, but...

107
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:22,719
Your skin is really beautiful.

108
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:27,958
It's exciting...

109
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,298
S-Say...

110
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,902
I-I'm sorry.

111
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,439
You guys shouldn't do anything to me!

112
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:45,479
Why did you say such thing?

113
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,318
Linia...

114
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:01,460
Linia...

115
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:10,837
You want to see, too?

116
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:15,304
You like Linia, don't you?

117
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:18,711
Um, Sayaka, I'm finished.

118
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:29,050
I like this one, is it okay?

119
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:33,457
Yes, it suits you, right?

120
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:38,129
Thank you.

121
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,720
I can't...

122
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:08,896
I couldn't restore her
memory past six months ago.

123
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:10,257
How come?

124
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,225
Her memory block
is very well protected.

125
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:16,397
I'm sure that there still
are memories in it, though.

126
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,471
Her newest parts are over ten years
old, and the skin damage rate is 0.07%.

127
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:26,977
Exhaustion is minimal.

128
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:29,108
Linia...

129
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:34,179
It seems you were carefully
stored somewhere for ten years.

130
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:35,850
Ten years...

131
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:40,485
I can't be absolutely positive
without researching more but...

132
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:45,425
I think this protection can be cleared
 only by the person who devised it.

133
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:49,337
You mean, the designer?

134
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:52,530
Yes, he's a real master.

135
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:55,470
A real Master...

136
00:15:58,714 --> 00:16:01,046
Anyway, this is all I know.

137
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:05,580
I have to access the
information bank at our school.

138
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,245
I'm bored!

139
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,685
Boring! I'm bored!

140
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:13,793
You don't play with me at all!

141
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:15,194
W-What?

142
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:19,098
We are sorry, Aki, but Linia
is a girl who needs our help.

143
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:23,804
Okay, fine.

144
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,868
Then, let's have a picnic.

145
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:30,437
We basically came here for fun...

146
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,977
I love you!

147
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:34,079
Yeah, yeah.

148
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,948
Well, I'll make a picnic basket then.

149
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:48,028
Yes, please.

150
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:12,042
Isn't it cold?

151
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:13,554
Stop it!

152
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:15,649
Wow!

153
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:18,022
Did you make all of them?

154
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,022
Yes, but it's not really...

155
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:27,536
Your fundamental program was
originally set up specializing in housework.

156
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,261
Yes!

157
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:33,407
Looks like Lui really likes your cooking.

158
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:35,510
Here.

159
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:38,278
I can't...

160
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:40,012
Oh, yes...

161
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:44,986
But, thank you so much.

162
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:52,392
You're bad!

163
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,361
You frightened me!

164
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,091
Sorry, I'm sorry.

165
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:18,745
Hey, hey, come on Lui!

166
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:24,725
She was unconscious because of av
temporary overload when you found her.

167
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:28,320
She had been running in
the woods for a long time.

168
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:32,022
Even though she overloaded...

169
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:37,064
Yes, I've never seen such a
perfect custom-made model.

170
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:41,302
Also, she was made
more than ten years ago...

171
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,808
Ten years ago, androids
looked like mechanical dolls.

172
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:49,107
Robot technology was still humble.

173
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:54,952
Do you think that has something
to do with her protected memories?

174
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,084
I don't know...

175
00:18:57,226 --> 00:19:00,923
Are you talking about that again?

176
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:01,961
Anyway...

177
00:19:02,164 --> 00:19:07,101
Linia seems like just a good housework
   model, but she is something more.

178
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:12,198
She has some kind of secret,
which even she doesn't know.

179
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:28,250
It's okay, Sayaka, I'll do it.

180
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:33,017
I'll lose my pride as a human
being if I make you do everything.

181
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:33,993
But...

182
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:35,485
It's okay.

183
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:37,464
I want to be with you.

184
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,429
I see.

185
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:42,431
Thank you, then.

186
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:43,528
Sure.

187
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:54,375
I guess this is good...

188
00:19:58,087 --> 00:19:58,917
Linia!

189
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:00,322
What happened?

190
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:03,051
Nothing, I'm okay...

191
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:04,884
Linia!

192
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:14,697
Misuzu, when will you finish?

193
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,169
Let's go to bed!

194
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:17,436
No way!

195
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:19,971
I have to research Linia.

196
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:22,874
Misuzu...

197
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:25,280
Hey, that's enough!

198
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:27,415
You're so mean!

199
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:28,540
I'm leaving.

200
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:33,810
Oh, well...

201
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:42,628
This is it.

202
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:50,362
Dr. Yusuke Zen, born in 1963.

203
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:53,898
His specialty is
android circuit control theory.

204
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:58,543
He published a complete chip
outline ten years ago and after that...

205
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:01,909
He's missing!

206
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:10,316
Oh, no.

207
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:16,761
Linia, what can I do for you?

208
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:19,996
I'm all right.

209
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:22,162
I'll be fine, soon.

210
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:26,366
No, you're not fine at all.

211
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:28,432
I'll bring Misuzu here.

212
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,750
Please don't leave...

213
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:37,984
Linia...

214
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:43,246
Linia?

215
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,752
Sayaka, I'm...

216
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,670
No, no...

217
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:12,753
No, Linia...

218
00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:16,283
Before I escaped from...

219
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:23,354
...the Black Broker and
came here I was remodeled.

220
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:27,197
Now, sometimes I can't control myself.

221
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,470
Linia...

222
00:22:33,742 --> 00:22:34,709
Master...

223
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:01,856
Master, you are wonderful...

224
00:24:07,703 --> 00:24:10,695
I'm not your master...

225
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:13,603
No...

226
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:17,277
...you are my master...

227
00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:21,113
T-That's...

228
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:28,081
I can be used by both sexes.

229
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:30,784
I wasn't asking if you were...

230
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:33,753
I love you, truly.

231
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:35,995
Linia...

232
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:35,116
So good, Linia...

233
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:42,630
Linia, I'm already...

234
00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:48,191
Master!

235
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:01,680
Master!

236
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:04,544
I'm coming!

237
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:18,396
Linia...

238
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:20,768
Blackout?

239
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:24,771
That's strange, this place has its
own generator, so it shouldn't blackout.
