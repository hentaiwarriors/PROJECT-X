1
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:13,317
Why don't you go and knock
on the front door?

2
00:00:13,493 --> 00:00:15,484
You found what she wanted, right?

3
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:20,757
No way! I am the mysterious thief,
Keith Ryan! I won't do that!

4
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:22,632
I just won't do it!

5
00:00:23,203 --> 00:00:24,227
That's some pride.

6
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:27,638
I'll hand this
Silver Rainbow directly to her.

7
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:31,208
My hand slipped!

8
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:43,311
That hurt. But, we're saved.

9
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:50,085
Beauty.

10
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:55,657
Who are you?

11
00:00:57,104 --> 00:01:02,508
Just a guy. My name's Keith Ryan.
And you? What's yours?

12
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:04,573
I'm Lyon Rumzeth.

13
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,042
Careful! Hold on tight!

14
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:17,786
Look! Open your eyes!

15
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:20,525
Look at me, and hold onto me tight!

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,197
Good, that's better.

17
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:45,109
That was close! You okay?

18
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:46,446
Yes.

19
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,218
You were after it?

20
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,960
All right, hold on tight! Giddy up!

21
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,694
The wheels are falling off.
Gently! Gently!

22
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:09,140
Romance is in the Flash of the Sword II

23
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,341
Episode 3: Oh no, Cursed Song!

24
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,362
Got rid of her?

25
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:35,559
She didn't look like someone
who'd stubbornly come after me like that.

26
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,899
She must've really cared about this.

27
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:40,565
Who would have known that this little...

28
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:45,607
What the hell is this thing?

29
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:49,070
It's here!

30
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:51,310
What is this junk?

31
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:54,978
This stuff must be some kind
of ancient treasure to that old hag.

32
00:02:57,457 --> 00:03:00,688
So long as I get paid for delivering this.

33
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,462
Look at all this.
Isn't this the lute of Rumzeth?

34
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,056
It sure is!

35
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:13,629
Made by Alan Rumzeth, the world renowned
maker of string instruments!

36
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,833
This is the rare and precious!

37
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:18,606
Lute of the Moon Singer!

38
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:21,178
This is an incredible treasure after all!

39
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:23,282
Lute of the Moon Singer?

40
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:34,726
That's not the deal!

41
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:54,302
Just give up!

42
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:56,774
It's no fun if she gives up too soon.

43
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,511
Smarter the prey,
more pleasurable the conquest.

44
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:06,351
Is that right?

45
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:09,323
It certainly is.

46
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:11,129
Of course it's all right!

47
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:18,265
What a huge estate!

48
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,607
Get up the speed.

49
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:28,037
Open them.

50
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:32,951
Yes, much better.

51
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:53,764
Stop it!

52
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,014
Let me hear it!

53
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:13,218
Almost there! Once I enter
those woods, I can make it.

54
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:22,232
I won't let you escape!

55
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:26,504
Just a bit more!

56
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:28,004
Not so easy.

57
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,142
No, please don't touch me!

58
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:04,572
Please don't come near me.

59
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:13,111
I'm asking you to stop.

60
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:18,586
What are you doing?

61
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,159
Stop it!

62
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,923
No, please don't!

63
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:32,236
It hurts!

64
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,380
It's too big!

65
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:52,080
I'm bursting!

66
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,535
Duke, a messenger from the King is here.

67
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:10,999
All right, then. Let us take
these girls to the basement.

68
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,977
I guess we lost him.

69
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:25,420
I apologize for roping you into this.

70
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:30,458
No, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't
have let the thief escape.

71
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,793
Is that the...

72
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,561
Looks like the robber's cart.

73
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:45,103
No one's around.
Let's check out the antique dealer.

74
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:46,801
What is it?

75
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:52,274
A town like this always has a couple
of dealers who specialize in stolen goods.

76
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,418
You're really knowledgeable.

77
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,887
- It's my job.
- Your job?

78
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,486
Why don't you wait here.
I'll go and get some information.

79
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:06,258
Yeah. I'll see you later.
Jut stay here, okay?

80
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Wow, what a swift person.

81
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:18,310
That was close!

82
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,312
I almost revealed my true identity.

83
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:24,278
Well, let the investigation begin!

84
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:36,761
I wonder what his profession is.

85
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:48,330
The music festival will be held here.

86
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:52,842
Let us drink wine to King Loon
and his excitement about the event.

87
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:57,741
What an honor. The Queen and the rest
of the royal family are to accompany him.

88
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:03,686
Of course, they won't miss the performance
of the famous Lute of the Moon Singer...

89
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,020
produced by the famous Rumzeth.

90
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,589
Certainly. But...

91
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:10,051
What is it?

92
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:13,826
There's a rumor about a group
of insurgents...

93
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,661
who intend to assassinate the King.

94
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:19,464
The elite force is to accompany
the King, but...

95
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:22,636
Make sure to keep tight security.

96
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:23,798
As you wish.

97
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:26,575
Let's go. Get the horses ready.

98
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,140
Why didn't you tell them
that you are...

99
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:35,244
the insurgents they were
talking about, Duke?

100
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:37,487
So it's you, Duchess Jarl.

101
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:43,324
Perhaps after tonight...

102
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:46,363
I'll be addressing you as King.

103
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:50,231
It all depends on how you perform tonight...

104
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:54,431
By the way, have you
got the Lute of the Moon Singer?

105
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,031
I will soon. Meanwhile...

106
00:09:58,211 --> 00:09:59,200
Yuck.

107
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:04,543
That old hag,
she's seducing him. Disgusting!

108
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:06,249
This plot's horrible!

109
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:10,755
They're planning on killing
every single member of the royal family!

110
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:14,786
How do you know
they're planning to kill them all?

111
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:18,125
Because, this isn't just a renowned lute.

112
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:22,199
It has another face.
A scary face that it keeps hidden.

113
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:24,864
Look at them.

114
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,433
Sickening!

115
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:36,547
Who's there!

116
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,540
- It's me!
- Idiot!

117
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:42,176
Who are you?

118
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:49,059
I'm just here to deliver
this lute for you, sir.

119
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:51,093
Lute of the Moon Singer?

120
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:53,892
It's you. You got it then. Well done.

121
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,794
But, why are you here?

122
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:59,531
When I went to your house,
I was told to come here.

123
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,306
Our security is tight, but how did you...

124
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:06,174
I am a great mysterious thief
named Lord Bagas...

125
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,474
and I can deal with any security.

126
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,545
Thanks for your trouble.

127
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:14,579
Wait a second there, Granny.

128
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:18,887
This job is worth way more
than the petty cash you offered.

129
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,756
Do you know what I mean?

130
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,294
Are you trying to up the price?

131
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:24,990
Too bad.

132
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,562
So, you heard everything.

133
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,773
Wait. I'll agree to the payment
that we negotiated.

134
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:41,880
I didn't mind it really.
It's worth the trouble.

135
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:44,312
I'm nothing more than a petty thief.

136
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:45,883
Goodbye!

137
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,318
Please, don't!

138
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,811
I heard that
a suspicious man with a scar...

139
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:17,074
entered this underground water outlet
with a lute.

140
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:20,883
What do we do?

141
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:25,449
I've got no other clue.

142
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,386
I've got no choice but to follow.

143
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:29,285
You mean, in there?

144
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,822
You'll be much safer if you wait here.

145
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:35,526
But I'm the one
who got you into this mess.

146
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:43,574
I don't want to put you in
any kind of danger.

147
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,610
If I'm not too much of a burden,
take me with you.

148
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:54,420
All right. Let's go!

149
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:58,524
- I won't let you escape!
- Please let go!

150
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:03,089
- I heard someone's voice.
- Female.

151
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:05,755
It hurts! You're ripping my tail off!

152
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:08,867
If you come quietly with me,
I won't hurt you. Too much.

153
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:14,131
No way! I'll never return.
It was supposed to be maid service.

154
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:16,141
They deceived me!

155
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:20,640
If you don't return,
they'll do the same thing to me...

156
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:22,077
so you better come back!

157
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:24,410
Hey, you okay!

158
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:26,050
Help please!

159
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:28,310
Okay, hold on!

160
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:31,522
I will not let you escape!

161
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,723
Careful!

162
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:42,557
I'm falling off again!

163
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:45,328
Let me hear the performance.

164
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,202
Hey, treat me with respect!

165
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:49,873
Hey, say something!

166
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:53,035
! I don't care about the performances,
please, untie the rope!

167
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,512
Don't leave me here!

168
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:03,580
Why are they locking the door?

169
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:07,584
Looks like they're going to experiment.

170
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,849
What?

171
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:10,417
What experiment?

172
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:13,361
Cursed Song.

173
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,599
Is the old hag going to perform it?

174
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:27,705
Lyon! Lyon!

175
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,673
Where did she go?

176
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:34,442
Probably fallen down elsewhere.

177
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:37,280
This place's a maze.

178
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:42,417
I could have sworn
I got away form them.

179
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:46,387
Keith.

180
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,788
Keith!

181
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:55,100
I wonder just where he ended up.

182
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:59,606
I'm in trouble.

183
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,343
I let that bunny girl escape.

184
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:05,973
Now, I'll be the one hunted down.

185
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:07,808
Keith!

186
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:13,224
I got an idea! As long as
it's a woman, the Duke's happy!

187
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,487
I know just how to fix this mess.

188
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,958
There seems to be no effect, Master.

189
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:26,099
Looks like the renowned instrument
only plays...

190
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:27,864
for a performer of its own choosing.

191
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,129
I agree.

192
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,037
Go right away and search
for a proper performer.

193
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:33,100
Yes sir!

194
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:59,671
Shit. What an old fix I got myself into.

195
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:04,101
It's better than being killed,
look on the bright side.

196
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:07,375
Well, I guess you've got a point there.

197
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:14,246
That old hag! Making me listen
to that performance without any pay!

198
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:17,982
I tried to tell you,
the bad performance saved us all.

199
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:32,363
I've got a bad feeling about this.

200
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:36,067
Hot! Hot! Hot!

201
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:41,377
Now, tell me!
Where's the owner of that lute?

202
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:46,047
I don't know! That old hag, she was...

203
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:49,381
she made me deliver the hot...

204
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:55,285
It's too much for me to handle.
I don't know anything about...

205
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:58,828
So, you'll pardon me?

206
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:09,130
I really don't know! She followed me
through the woods...

207
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,539
what was I supposed to do?

208
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:12,133
Where about?

209
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:16,305
Just outside the town.
By the river, near the woods!

210
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:18,005
You heard him.

211
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:19,773
Yes sir.

212
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:25,684
I have a bad feeling.

213
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:38,930
He might've been better off dead.

214
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:50,916
That's the Duke's voice. This way!

215
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,072
Come on!

216
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,582
That's too bad.

217
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:03,818
Duke! I brought you a woman in place
of the bunny rabbit!

218
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:10,466
I guess he's not just into women.

219
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:14,329
The thief who stole my lute!

220
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:17,865
What!

221
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:22,242
The owner of the Lute of the Moon Singer?

222
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:36,458
The light!

223
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:38,663
We finally got out!

224
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,268
Just like Master told me:
The best way to get out of a maze...

225
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,133
is to always keep to the left!

226
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:49,533
Now I can go back home!
I'm so happy!

227
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:53,276
Where's Lyon? She's still not back.

228
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:55,143
Here, take this.

229
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,612
- Carrots?
- Sign of my gratitude.

230
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:00,541
Thanks.

231
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:03,621
Bye-bye! See you later!

232
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:12,096
- I won't go back, no!
- What are you?

233
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:14,532
Disappeared!

234
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,689
Above us!

235
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:17,124
Good instinct!

236
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,047
What's this?

237
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:36,987
I can't breathe.

238
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:41,357
Sleeping vapor.

239
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:54,671
This is not an impossible request.

240
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:58,207
Simply use your lute
and sing the Cursed Song.

241
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,210
Play it less powerful. Just enough
to make the listeners fall asleep.

242
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:06,577
Because you see, my dear,
we have to keep everyone happy.

243
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:08,184
I will not do it.

244
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:11,052
Very well.

245
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:31,376
You'll soon feel better.

246
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:32,533
Stop.

247
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:49,326
You bitch!

248
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,657
Duke, I'm so sorry for the delay.

249
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:57,224
We caught the owner
of the lute by the red cart.

250
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,430
Who's this woman?

251
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:03,096
Keith!

252
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:05,198
He helped me.

253
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:08,302
Lyon.

254
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:13,574
Excuse me, Duke. The King
and his company have arrived!

255
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:26,020
What have I done to deserve this!

256
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:31,698
I'm sure Keith will sort this out.

257
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:34,933
How could you do this to me?

258
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,911
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

259
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:47,849
Let me introduce the renown singer
Lyon Rumzeth.

260
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:51,254
Who shall play the Lute of the Moon Singer.

261
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:54,458
I trust you'll enjoy the performance.

262
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:11,437
What're you up to?
Forcing her to perform like that...

263
00:22:11,577 --> 00:22:13,306
that's really cruel!

264
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,740
You don't know? Lute of the Moon Singer
can produce the Cursed Song...

265
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,942
which will kill the listeners
after driving them insane.

266
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:22,983
You mean to kill the King and all?

267
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:24,384
Yes.

268
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:28,650
But I asked her not to unleash
the full power of the instrument.

269
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:33,025
Otherwise, even if we couldn't hear
the song, we'd be in danger.

270
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:36,060
The Cursed Song is as terrible as that.

271
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:39,571
And that's why, all we want
is for them to fall fast asleep.

272
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:44,671
I'll pull this lever, and the boat,
along with them all, will then sink.

273
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:47,175
And they will all be drowned together.

274
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:50,075
Don't you think
it's a beautiful plan, my boy?

275
00:22:51,684 --> 00:22:53,618
You mean to kill her, too?

276
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:57,788
But of course. You're friends
in the basement, too.

277
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,087
Under our feet.

278
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,960
No loose ends. Don't worry, though.
You'll be following right after.

279
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:09,126
How will you feel when you're struggling
for your last breath in the water?

280
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:10,826
You devil!

281
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:13,737
Let's see...

282
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:17,705
It's almost ready.

283
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:21,544
That woman, she must really like this lad.

284
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:24,980
- Get him to stand up.
- Yes sir.

285
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:28,845
What a lucky fellow.

286
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:30,911
Jealous?

287
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,182
Look!

288
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:39,195
Keith?

289
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:41,423
I'm okay! Continue singing!

290
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,191
Just keep going.

291
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:44,300
But...

292
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:47,429
We'll all be killed! Quick!

293
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:53,300
Duke?

294
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:04,284
Let go! Otherwise, you'll be dead too!
Along with your friends.

295
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:06,150
Never!

296
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:31,176
- I'll take you with me!
- No way!

297
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:37,681
Stop! Please stop!

298
00:24:56,408 --> 00:24:58,342
- Keith.
- Lyon.

299
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:02,104
You did it! How about the King!

300
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:06,206
They're fine.

301
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:09,521
They all fell asleep with my lullaby.

302
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,352
But why aren't you affected?

303
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:14,948
What did you say?

304
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:19,953
Look.

305
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:24,198
It's strange.
Earplugs usually don't work.

306
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,500
Really, no way.

307
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:32,138
Maybe that means I'm special to you.

308
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:33,867
Maybe.

309
00:25:35,514 --> 00:25:37,505
Really, you mean it?

310
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:44,478
- Lyon?
- Yes?

311
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:47,824
I want to hear your love song.

312
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,688
You'll let me sing it?

313
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,909
Be gentle.

314
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:23,758
It hurts.

315
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:35,635
You're so wet.

316
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,841
I'm embarrassed.

317
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:41,841
Don't tease me.

318
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,147
Really wet.

319
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:57,922
- Can I go inside you?
- Hurry quick!

320
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,427
Don't make me wait!

321
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:02,266
Open your legs wider!

322
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:06,570
I want to see more.

323
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:08,200
Don't tease me.

324
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:14,478
I'm going crazy!

325
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:16,742
This is so incredible!

326
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:58,989
Elfarcia!

327
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:04,094
I'll enter from the front door.

328
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:15,232
A flower girl?

329
00:28:16,742 --> 00:28:18,505
This early in the morning?

330
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:22,308
I guess I'll get some flowers for Elfarcia.

331
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,514
Where's she going?
Hey, you left your basket!

332
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:34,119
Kind of strange wood.

333
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:37,060
Where did she go?

334
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:50,504
Beauty.
