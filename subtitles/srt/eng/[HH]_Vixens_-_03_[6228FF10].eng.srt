1
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,315
Please, help me...!

2
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,167
S-stop, please.

3
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,307
Help!

4
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:55,272
St-stop!

5
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,953
Vampires?!

6
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:30,634
Right. Yesterday Mina Matsuda
disappeared from the grounds!

7
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,402
Disappeared from the grounds...?

8
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,803
She came here yesterday,
but l heard she...

9
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,572
never went home or
went out anywhere.

10
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:43,438
So it's just like Yuka who
disappeared two months ago.

11
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,583
You think it's the work of vampires?

12
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,890
l don't know...
but Kurahashi from class A said...

13
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,757
he saw the shadow of a human
with bat's wings.

14
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,461
Kurahashi saw that?

15
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,259
Right. Last week when
the astronomy club...

16
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:00,731
stayed over to watch the stars.

17
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,529
lt seems pretty credible.

18
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,736
Hmm...l guess.
lf Kurahashi saw it...

19
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,267
l'm scared. lsn't this
the sixth person this year...

20
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,403
who has just disappeared?

21
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,841
And they were all pretty women
who stood out in college.

22
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,618
Yikes! That means l'd
better watch out too!

23
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,949
Yeah, right.

24
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,119
But Sayuri, you should be...

25
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,032
Talk to you later, okay?

26
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,899
- Stand up!
- Bow!

27
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,506
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

28
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,973
Sit down.

29
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:46,574
Let me introduce a new student.
Miss Otaki.

30
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,781
She just returned from Europe.

31
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,888
My name is Kanna Otaki.

32
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:59,187
l came back to Japan
because of my father's job.

33
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,186
Nice to meet all of you.

34
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,254
For now...why don't you
sit at that desk over there.

35
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:11,797
She is absent today, but we'll
get you your own desk this week.

36
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,601
Okay.

37
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,466
Let's continue with
yesterday's lesson...

38
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,936
-Don't worry.
-Huh?

39
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,814
The person who sits there, Yuka,
there's a story about her.

40
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,745
My name's Sayuri.
Nice to meet you.

41
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,116
You too.

42
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,198
Today l've set the bar low
so you can focus on your form...

43
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:44,465
when you jump backwards.
Okay, let's go in order...

44
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,733
That's why you really shouldn't
stay here after dark.

45
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,975
Because the vampires come out!

46
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:58,507
Va-vampires? They're just a
superstition, right?

47
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:05,079
Well, l was skeptical till now,
but someone saw one!

48
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,248
Look, that guy on the end there.

49
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,251
He saw one?

50
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,355
Kurahashi. He's the student president
and usually number one...

51
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:17,266
in scholastic ability tests.
What's more, he's handsome!

52
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,631
Well, his appearance doesn't matter...

53
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,002
but he's definitely
someone you can trust.

54
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,972
Right, l agree with our
assistant student president Sayuri.

55
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:34,550
Hey, over there! Quit gabbing.
lt's your turn!

56
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,809
Okay!

57
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,958
Here l go!

58
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:04,038
All right! Next is the new student,
Kanna Otaki.

59
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,415
Okay!

60
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:15,457
Are you all right?

61
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:23,528
l-l'm okay... l've been
dieting recently, so...

62
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,127
ls she okay?

63
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,766
Hmm, probably a little anemic.

64
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,341
Hey, Kurahashi!
Give me a hand here!

65
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,312
All right!

66
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,134
CLINIC

67
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:48,158
l was going to leave soon...

68
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,163
but l'll stay and let her
rest until she comes to.

69
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,488
Thank you very much.

70
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,159
Oh, Kurahashi?

71
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,136
Yes?

72
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:03,608
Recently l heard some strange rumors...
come see her later.

73
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:07,112
Oh, s-sure!

74
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:19,149
l met with the dean this morning,
and basically,

75
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:22,444
{\an8}STUDENT COUNCIL MEETING

76
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:22,684
the college cannot pass rumors
about vampires...

77
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:26,987
or anything else strange like that on
to the police.

78
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,693
Essentially, the missing person's
family files a report

79
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,433
with the police identifying the missing
person as a runaway.

80
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,699
Since we have no evidence
of kidnapping...

81
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,537
there is no choice but
to treat them this way.

82
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:44,576
Since we can't expect the college or
police to do anything...

83
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:49,719
l have a way for the student council
to alleviate the students' concerns.

84
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,907
Kurahashi!

85
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,443
No, l won't let you come yet...

86
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,690
That was great!

87
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,202
Morning! Morning!

88
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,977
Morning!

89
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,119
ls something wrong?

90
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:09,518
Sayuri...

91
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,413
Huh?! Did something happen to Sayuri?

92
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,991
Sayuri became the
seventh one to disappear.

93
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,827
What do you mean?

94
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:20,794
Yesterday, after attending
the student council meeting,

95
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,926
she disappeared...

96
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,493
We just went to ask
at the student council room...

97
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,133
Since we can't expect
the college or police to do anything...

98
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:35,008
l have a way for the student council
to alleviate the students' concerns.

99
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:40,753
After sunset today, we have
someone act as a decoy and...

100
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,778
walk around to attract the vampires.

101
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,951
Of course, we, members
of the student council, will hide in

102
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,021
each spot the decoy will walk through.

103
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,965
And you think you will
actually capture a vampire that way?

104
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,838
lf we don't find one,

105
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:04,104
then we can persuade everyone
that they don't exist, right?

106
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:08,304
l think it's a good idea.
What do you think, Kurahashi?

107
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,980
Yeah, it seems worth trying anyway.

108
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:16,248
Having seen one of them,
l believe they exist.

109
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,848
What do we do if we find one?

110
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:23,989
Let's bring a cross and
holy water from the chapel.

111
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:28,265
They say that vampires have
no power against holy water.

112
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,767
But what about the decoy?

113
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:38,104
Based on who's vanished so far,
we need an attractive woman.

114
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:46,442
<i>And so Sayuri became the decoy
and was walking around...</i>

115
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,284
What was that?!

116
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,768
Those are Sayuri's shoes!

117
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:11,637
They said no one saw a vampire,
but Sayuri still disappeared...

118
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:12,937
What about Kurahashi?

119
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,981
When the dean heard about this
he gave him a 3-day suspension.

120
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,153
What should we do?
Me, l'm so scared...

121
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:30,890
Yesterday l read about vampires
in a book at home.

122
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,829
lf Sayuri really was
abducted by vampires...

123
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,828
we have to save her tonight!

124
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:41,696
lf not, she'll be turned
into a vampire herself!

125
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,635
But the college, the student
council and the police...

126
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,440
won't do anything!

127
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,947
So we just have to do it ourselves!

128
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:01,418
You two are Sayuri's
best friends, right?!

129
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,138
<i>Misako, you go get
some garlic from the dining hall.</i>

130
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:30,344
<i>And Kyoko, you get some
holy water from the chapel.</i>

131
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:44,169
<i>After dark, l'll be the decoy
and try to attract the vampire.</i>

132
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,935
<i>l'll run to where you two
are hiding, so please stay there.</i>

133
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:52,905
<i>Now if you see a vampire,
make sure you throw holy water on it!</i>

134
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,943
Misako...

135
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,643
Nothing's happening.

136
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,309
l wonder if there really are vampires.

137
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,604
Oh no! Kyoko! Misako!

138
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,945
l'm too late...

139
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,731
Couldn't be...

140
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,588
Misako...Misako...

141
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,599
We got caught!

142
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,772
Sayuri!

143
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,611
Misako! Kyoko!

144
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,549
Silence!

145
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,587
A vampire!

146
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:32,592
You two are now slaves of
Dracula like these others!

147
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,963
D-Dracula...

148
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:37,474
Sayuri...in exchange
for becoming my slave...

149
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,034
l will give you everlasting life.

150
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,304
S-stop...

151
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:59,820
lf we don't hurry,
Sayuri is going to...

152
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,667
Sayuri!

153
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,738
l got him!

154
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,918
What was that?!

155
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,250
Wh-why?

156
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,464
Because this jerk is not
a vampire or anything else...

157
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,523
holy water doesn't do a thing!

158
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,624
Who's there?!

159
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,463
You forgot this!
Mr. Student President!

160
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:48,108
l accidently saw you yesterday
in the clinic with the nurse.

161
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,974
You were wearing that
pendant around your neck.

162
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:54,650
Th-that's a lie!
l'm not the student president!

163
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,815
Kurahashi!

164
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,319
Ohashi!

165
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:08,332
Sakai!

166
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,490
Even Kamijo!

167
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,005
- Kanna!
- Kanna!

168
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,679
lt's like you woke up
from a dream, isn't it?

169
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,679
A dream...?

170
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:28,013
Right. You were being fooled,
kept in this spooky room...

171
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:32,820
by these phonies. They even
used my grandfather's name!

172
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:34,515
Gr-grandfather?

173
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:39,759
That's right. My grandfather
is the true Dracula.

174
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,336
lt was hearing rumors about
vampires in Japanese colleges...

175
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,538
that brought me back from Transylvania.

176
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,769
To protect the honor and
security of vampires.

177
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:54,202
The h-honor and...
security of... vampires?

178
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:59,110
You've got it. Nowadays we are
existing alongside humans.

179
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,252
Rumors about real vampires
or fake vampires...

180
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,812
all make trouble for us.

181
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,952
That's why l was sent here
as a vampire hunter!

182
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,999
Kanna!

183
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,160
Wh-what should we do, Kurahashi?

184
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:23,300
Damn! ln this situation we have to
fight or we'll be destroyed!

185
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,405
Let's go!

186
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:41,148
Human beings have no
chance against real vampires.

187
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,519
Ju-just a minute.

188
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,797
Are you going to suck our blood?

189
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,967
You fool. lf l did that then
you would become vampires too.

190
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:54,603
Th-then...

191
00:22:55,106 --> 00:23:02,444
We don't get our energy only
by sucking blood.

192
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,646
Y-you mean...

193
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,810
Exactly!

194
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,089
You're kidding!

195
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,498
E-excellent!

196
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:36,045
Now we start the real punishment!

197
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,307
R-real punish....

198
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,638
l can deal with this type of punishment!

199
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:10,637
We're just getting started.

200
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:23,122
l want to...punish them too!

201
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:25,594
Me too! Me too! Me too!

202
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:30,358
Well, let's join in!

203
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,300
Punishment! Punishment!

204
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,304
l'm going to come!

205
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:52,987
Pl-please stop! Let me go!
l'm gonna die!

206
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:57,150
No...give me more, more...!

207
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,997
There's nothing left in there.

208
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:07,168
Come...come...come...come...

209
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:13,009
Stop! Stop! Please stop!

210
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,514
Oh well, so much for my diet...

211
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,795
lt's better than passing
out from anemia, right?

212
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,958
But Kanna, how did you find that place?

213
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,633
Well, l found that pendant
where you guys disappeared.

214
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,638
l knew it belonged to Kurahashi
and he was...

215
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,641
supposed to be suspended.
Also he was a member...

216
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:47,304
of the astronomy club and
the only one to see a vampire.

217
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,637
l got it! So you looked in...

218
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,172
the astronomy club's room
and found that basement area.

219
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,811
Do you have to leave?

220
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,656
Yes. l'm half vampire and half human,

221
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:06,062
so l'm fine in the daylight,
but l can only change form in the dark.

222
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,333
But you're our friend...

223
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,501
Well, l'd better go.

224
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:25,182
- Kanna, take care!
- See you again!

225
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,177
Don't forget us!

226
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:41,162
''Pretending to be vampires,
they used female students as playings.''

227
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,631
''Signed, a real vampire.''

228
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,792
Disgusting!

229
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,634
So it was Kurahashi
and his friends all along!

230
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,636
l'm disappointed!

231
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:52,503
l can't do it anymore.
l can't do it anymore.

232
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,339
Please let me go...
