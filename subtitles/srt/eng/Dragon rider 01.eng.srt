1
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,310
Once upon a time, when
swords and sorcery ruled all things...

2
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:15,122
The Dragon Devil clan
emerged from beyond time and space.

3
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:18,353
They laid waste to the earth, and
pandemonium filled the human world.

4
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:22,489
ln order to save humanity, the Dragon
Knights bravely fought against them...

5
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:23,691
...astride their own dragons.

6
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:31,035
The battle with the Dragon God clan
was the second war between God and Devil.

7
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:34,001
After the struggle, a
controller of magic named Reyna...

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,306
...confined the three kings of the
Dragon Devil clan, Uruto, Golgo, and lrya.

9
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,107
Musa, a knight of the Dragon God clan...

10
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:45,710
...entered the Devil world in order to
annihilate the rest of the Dragon Devil clan.

11
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:50,886
Musa, don't think
you have already won.

12
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:56,426
l will definitely resurrect the
three gods and destroy you!

13
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:00,026
Oruga!

14
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,001
Where are you hiding?

15
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:07,609
Hey Oruga, you're thinking of slipping
away through time and space, aren't you?

16
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:16,181
The castle of the Dragon Devil clan was
destroyed and peace returned to the world.

17
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:20,280
And then, ten years passed...

18
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:53,981
Thief!

19
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,756
What will you do?

20
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,064
What?

21
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:13,064
Mom!

22
00:02:14,577 --> 00:02:15,703
ls that so?

23
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,439
You want to return to the
castle and become a Dragon Knight?

24
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:23,746
Yes, my name is Rike, Rike Arrow.

25
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:28,353
Sorry, she thought you were a thief.

26
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:32,851
Karisu is so careless, l
wonder if she'll ever get married...

27
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:36,662
Oh, yes, Rike, would
you like to marry her?

28
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,198
Wait, Mom!

29
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:40,195
No thanks, not my type.

30
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:42,395
What did you mean by saying that?

31
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:43,996
Well, let me see...

32
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:48,332
Thank you for dinner.

33
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:49,603
Time to go.

34
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:53,875
To be a Dragon Knight, l have to
find my own dragon, so l have to go.

35
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:54,943
Dragon!

36
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:56,719
ls that so?

37
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:58,276
l hope you can find one.

38
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:06,558
What is that?

39
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:20,873
lt's the Dragon Devil clan!

40
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,908
Karisu, Aunt, run away, now!

41
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:27,844
How about you?

42
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:29,581
l will fight with them!

43
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:31,844
l am a knight.

44
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:33,584
How can l run away?

45
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:49,433
Before the three Devil gods are
reborn, l must kill everyone in this town.

46
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:07,551
l got it.

47
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:14,656
Mom, hurry up!

48
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:15,197
Oh!

49
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:16,197
Mom!

50
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:19,132
Karisu, l'm okay, so go ahead!

51
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,429
l can't do that.

52
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,528
Wait a little, l will save you...

53
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:23,866
Forget about it.

54
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,232
lf you do...

55
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,103
But...

56
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,782
Aunt, Karisu!

57
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:44,290
Asshole!

58
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:49,623
Aunt, shit!

59
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:50,255
Karisu...

60
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:53,435
<i>Flying Dragon Transformation!</i>

61
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:57,763
Karisu!

62
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:11,450
<i>Flying Dragon Strike!</i>

63
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,924
Karisu?

64
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,289
What are those wings?

65
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:21,689
This is my other form.

66
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:24,593
Rike, please take care of my Mom.

67
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:28,463
Wait, Karisu.

68
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:33,498
God damn, Dragon
Devil, killing innocent people...

69
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:37,541
That girl is...

70
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:39,113
<i>Vacuum Flight!</i>

71
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:45,821

<i>Rising Dragon Stomp!</i>

73
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:52,727
<i>Dancing Razor Gale!</i>

74
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:57,458
You killed my group of
Dragon Devils in a moment.

75
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,533
But, you can't kill me like that.

76
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,803
Your attack failed!

77
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:15,207
Shit!

78
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,250
Cut it out, now!

79
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,244
Mom...

80
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,949
l will tear you to shreds.

00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:31,228
Musa, you came all the way here!

84
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:33,793
Who are you...

85
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:36,671
Karisu, can you fly?

86
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:37,603
What?

87
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:38,162
Yeah...

88
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:43,175
She knows my name.

89
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:44,704
Who is she?

90
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:04,230
Karisu...

91
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:13,371
Karisu, l have to report the
Dragon Devil clan to my king right away!

92
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,167
l have to go.

93
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:23,116
We will go together...

94
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,220
Rike, please take me with you.

95
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:31,254
l want to know...

96
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,627
Who l really am...

97
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:36,329
What happened in my past...

98
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:42,231
Otherwise, l won't be able to
live in peace in the human world.

99
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:50,143
All right, let's go to
the capitol together.

100
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:50,973
Rike...

101
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,837
Yes.

102
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:55,239
Sorry, Mom.

103
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:56,751
l'm leaving you all alone.

104
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,411
She was a very kind
mother, wasn't she?

105
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:04,885
Mom saved me when l was abandoned
by the forest lake sixteen years ago.

106
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:08,525
Hiding the fact that l was
the descendent of a dragon...

107
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:11,431
...she brought me up as her daughter.

108
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:13,530
However...

109
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:16,602
Rike...

110
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:17,636
Rike...

111
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:18,831
Rike...

112
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:21,207
No, Mom!

113
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:22,574
Don't die!

114
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,770
Don't leave me here alone.

115
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,047
No, Mom!

116
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:40,524
Hey, Rike?

117
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:42,995
Why do you really
want to be a Dragon Knight?

118
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:45,862
lt's always been every
young man's dream to be one.

119
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:51,633
lt's not easy to find one's own dragon.

120
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,976
However, l will
definitely be a Dragon Knight.

121
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,169
For myself and my dad!

122
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:56,734
Your father?

123
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,677
Yes, l was found by
my foster father, like you.

124
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,551
He had a hard time
bringing me up by himself.

125
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:07,384
l want to let make him proud
by becoming a Dragon Knight.

126
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,624
You are so kind, Rike.

127
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,748
Not really, l'm just...

128
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,395
Rike's dragon...

129
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,891
l have no choice!

130
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,695
l'll be your dragon.

131
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:23,630
What?

132
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:24,604
What do you mean?

133
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:28,410
<i>Red Dragon Transformation!</i>

134
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:36,413

Dragon!

136
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:46,191
This is my true form.

00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:57,464
Sure!

lt's wonderful and amazing, Karisu!

144
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:07,280
Thanks.

145
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:15,591
You know what, Karisu?

146
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,926
Can my thoughts reach you, too?

147
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:23,693
lt's impossible now,
you need a little practice.

148
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,801
Wish strongly with
my image in your heart.

149
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,000
lf you do, your thoughts will
definitely reach me someday soon.

150
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:35,069
Wish strongly, huh?

151
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,753
l didn't know that Karisu had been
reincarnated in the human world...

152
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:51,653
Destiny is strange.

153
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:56,594
Karisu, l wonder if l
should wake you up.

154
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,572
Karisu, look.

155
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:09,877
That is Dragon's Eye, the
king's castle of Dragoon kingdom.

156
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:18,348
Who is flying up there?

157
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:21,489
Hold on, where is Ramie?

158
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:25,255
Ramie, come out, now!

159
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,727
That you, Ramie?

160
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,260
You shouldn't come such a place.

161
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:34,234
Horrific Demon gods
have been confined here.

162
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:47,510
Okay, nobody is here.

163
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:50,082
l will transform into a human.

164
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:56,558
Here l am.

165
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:57,816
What is this dragon?

166
00:11:58,294 --> 00:11:59,226
lt's an illusion.

167
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,756
l used a magic called lllusion.

168
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:05,200
This is embarrassing, so
please put me down now.

169
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:12,098
Rike, are you okay?

170
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,824
Rike!

171
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:32,992
Rike...

172
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,360
l love you...

173
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:36,523
l love you very much.

174
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:50,443
Rike, please come back soon...

175
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:51,343
Rike.

176
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,548
Rike, do you have to go?

177
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:04,150
Yes, l will definitely find
my dragon and come back.

178
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:09,230
Lydia, if l become a Dragon
Knight, l will always stay with you.

179
00:13:13,469 --> 00:13:14,401
l'm so happy.

180
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,177
Oh, there, yes.

181
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,050
Rike...

182
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:34,913
lf Rike doesn't stay with me, l will be...

183
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,359
l love you, Rike...

184
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:40,260
Princess!

185
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,632
Hey, what are you doing?

186
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:46,430
Ramie...

187
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:49,202
Princess, Rike came back!

188
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:53,403
ls it true?

189
00:13:53,475 --> 00:13:54,373
lt's true, isn't it?

190
00:13:54,443 --> 00:13:55,671
Thanks, Ramie!

191
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:57,575
Dad!

192
00:13:57,847 --> 00:13:59,576
Oh, Rike, you came back!

193
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:01,681
You look fine, yes.

194
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,478
Absolutely.

195
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,210
Daddy, look.

196
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:06,421
Wow...

197
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:08,721
That's a wonderful dragon.

198
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:11,053
Rike, who is the girl?

199
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:12,794
Daddy, let me introduce her.

200
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:14,619
She is Karisu from Tarutarp village.

201
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:18,262
Karisu, this is my father.

202
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,359
Nice to meet you.

203
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,272
Hey, my son, how did you find her?

204
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:29,035
lt is hard to find such a beautiful girl.

205
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:30,642
Hey, tell me.

206
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,038
Ouch!

207
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:33,206
Rike!

208
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:37,416
Lydia!

209
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:41,079
Welcome back!

210
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,685
l've been worried about you!

211
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,225
l am sorry, Lydia.

212
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,561
But you have become
so beautiful in a short time.

213
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,722
Well, thanks.

214
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:49,889
Rike!

215
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:52,562
Oh, Lydia, let me introduce her.

216
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:53,394
She is...

217
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:54,996
Nice to meet you.

218
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:59,200
My name is Karisu and l have
traveled with Rike all this time.

219
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,237
All this time?

220
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:03,506
ls that true, Rike?

221
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,507
Oh, yeah, l have to go to the castle.

222
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:09,115
All right, l will go back and wait for you.

223
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:10,173
Okay, l got it.

224
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,120
Please explain what's going on later.

225
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:17,022
See you, Karisu, talk to you soon.

226
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:20,255
Yes, we will be good friends.

227
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:26,998
ls that so?

228
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:29,193
Tarutarp village was
attacked by the Dragon Devil clan?

229
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:31,600
Send two Dragon Knights to Tarutarp.

230
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:32,231
Yes, Sir.

231
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:36,034
Rike, welcome back from
your long training journey.

232
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:38,877
Let me see your
own dragon, right now.

233
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:39,747
Sure.

234
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:52,994
Wow, it's a wonderful dragon.

235
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:57,991
l think you are
qualified to be a Dragon Knight.

236
00:15:58,434 --> 00:15:59,958
You are too lenient!

237
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,499
We are called the strongest
Dragon Knights in the world.

238
00:16:04,974 --> 00:16:08,842
lf you accept such a young boy as a
Dragon Knight, we will be dishonored.

239
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:13,144
Oh god, l can't believe that they
are fighting over Lydia's love here.

240
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:16,513
That's right, it's hard
to control a jealous guy.

241
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:20,211
Rike, l don't approve of a
Dragon Knight being so young.

242
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,017
Say that again!

243
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:22,881
Stop, stupid boys!

244
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:25,756
Fighting in front of me is
the last thing you want to do.

245
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:29,029
l reject your initiation
into the Dragon Knights!

246
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,697
l would say that, but
it would be no fun at all...

247
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:32,766
Right, Leon?

248
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:33,529
Yes, Sir.

249
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:37,297
l will give you a chance to
fight each other as Dragon Knights.

250
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:39,598
You will have a contest of
flying speed as Dragon Knights.

251
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:42,542
lf Rike wins, l will approve of his
membership in the Dragon Knights.

252
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:44,544
l'll show you!

253
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,505
What?

254
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:46,548
That's my line!

255
00:16:47,316 --> 00:16:48,681
Don't cry later.

256
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:56,814
l can't believe that Rike left
right after he met with my father.

257
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:59,893
Why didn't he come to see me?

258
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:03,027
Karisu somehow bothers me...

259
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:04,091
Ramie!

260
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:10,565
Princess, did you call me?

261
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:12,098
Ramie, do me a favor.

262
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,805
Please go to see what
Rike is doing, right now.

263
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:15,944
What?

264
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,000
lt's so late.

265
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,506
Please, only you can help me.

266
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:22,507
l really want to know what's going on.

267
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:24,250
Jesus...

268
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:29,352
lf you use magic for trivial
things, your late mother would cry.

269
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:31,989
My mom is my mom!

270
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:33,255
l am me!

271
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,528
Love is a scary thing.

272
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:54,274
Who are you?

273
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:56,918
Ms. Avisu...

274
00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:58,815
Please stop.

275
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:01,250
Ms. Reyna's tomb is
located in this room!

276
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:04,921
We can't let you in,
even if you are Lydia's nurse.

277
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:34,183
l see, you'll fight with Voon.

278
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,682
Good, good...

279
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:40,189
When l was young, l often
fought with the king, Kaizerd.

280
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:42,257
But today, l was impressed.

281
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:45,264
Because you came back
with such a beautiful wife.

282
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:46,664
You're joking!

283
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:47,963
Such a kidder...

284
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:50,503
No, no, we aren't...

285
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:52,870
l mean, she isn't my wife...

286
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:53,600
What?

287
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,176
lf you are a man, you
have to make it clear.

288
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,570
Yeah, about that...

289
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,939
Karisu, please explain exactly.

290
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,817
Rike, l want to have your baby soon.

291
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:04,512
K-Karisu!

292
00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:08,616
lf you say no, l'll take her!

293
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:15,088
He doesn't know who he's dealing with!

294
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:16,453
You fool, Rike!

295
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:20,858
Relax, you'll break your best crystal!

296
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:21,831
Avisu?

297
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:24,569
l'm your nurse...

298
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,840
lf you're hiding something, l'll find out.

299
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:30,244
You love Rike, don't you?

300
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,148
Avisu, l'm so sad.

301
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:34,877
Oh dear!
Avisu, l'm so sad.

302
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:36,945
You are the descendent of...

303
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:41,422
...a controller of magic, you can easily
dispose of a young woman like Karisu.

304
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:43,824
Don't worry.

305
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:46,358
l prepared everything for you.

306
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:48,120
lt's up to you now...

307
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,292
Avisu!

308
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:50,160
l...

309
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,029
l'll try.

310
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:00,473
These women were highly skilled.

311
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,708
ln addition, they've
taken away the Rod.

312
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:05,579
Who could have done it?

313
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:06,204
lndeed...

314
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:08,974
Anyway, report it to the king.

315
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:09,608
Yes.

316
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:19,089
During the second war between
God and Devil, one of the three devils...

317
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,089
...Golgo, was confined.

318
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:25,093
When he rapes a woman...

319
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:29,166
...he traps her and sucks up all her
spirit, turning her into a vegetable.

320
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:34,370
Let's use Golgo to keep
Karisu's heart away from Rike.

321
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:46,453
Come to me, Devil Golgo!

322
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,243
Finally, l broke the seal over the devil.

323
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,805
Golgo, l command you!

324
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,117
You've been trapped, Lydia.

325
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:21,954
l'm not Avisu.

326
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:24,115
l am Oruga from the Dragon Devil clan.

327
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:25,123
You're kidding...

328
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,896
Great three Devils, listen.

329
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:37,497
lt is time for the
Dragon Devil clan to be reborn.

330
00:21:55,657 --> 00:22:00,219
lt's been a while,
Sir Uruto, Sir Golgo, and Lady lrya.

331
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:01,987
Oruga, you did a good job.

332
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:06,664
Listen, Kaizerd the Third, we finally
have a chance to take revenge on you.

333
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:09,463
And on the magic
controller who confined us...

But her daughter is there, look...

00:22:17,145 --> 00:22:19,375
You arranged things very well.

337

ln that case, l will enjoy her slowly.

338
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:23,979

Cry more, scream more.

Golgo, you haven't changed.

346

348
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:52,476

Stop, l'm embarrassed!

354
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:05,886

Please don't do it!

359
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,924

She is the daughter of Reyna, a
controller of magic. How shameful!

368
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:41,946
We don't have to fear her now.
