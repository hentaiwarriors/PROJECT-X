1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,580
I did it!

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,950
I found it!

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,880
I passed! I passed!

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,320
1701... 1701....

5
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,460
1701... 1701... 1701...

6
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,310
1701... 1701...

7
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,430
I found it!

8
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,160
I did it! I did it!

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,920
Congratulation!! You passed your exam!

10
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,820
Thanks!

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,710
Magical Twilight 2

12
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,050
And now, it's time to say good bye.

13
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,100
So, what is our closing present for a
home viewers this week?

14
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,470
This week, we're giving away a trip for
two to the Nozawa Hot Spring Hotel!

15
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,330
Well, who's our lucky winner this week?

16
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,920
And here we are! Our winner!

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,480
What? Well...

18
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,320
Tachibana Tsukasa, in Suginami!

19
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,970
What the...?

20
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,120
Congratulations!

21
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,380
Chipple?!

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,020
We'll see you next week!

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,820
A little present from me.

24
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,000
You've been wanting to go
to the hot springs, haven't you.

25
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,230
Tsukasa?

26
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,840
Chipple?

27
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,720
It's me!

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,700
You can pretend not to be here if
you want to, you can't fool me!

29
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,120
Don't play games with me!

30
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,520
What?

31
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,360
Now where did they go?

32
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,380
What's wrong? You're so quiet.

33
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,480
Nothing.

34
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,350
Aren't you enjoying yourself? This is
supposed to be a special vacation.

35
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,530
I am, but I keep thinking this prize
should have gone to someone else.

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,110
I thought Tsukasa would be so happy with this prize.

37
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,040
Using magic's the only thing a witch can do.

38
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,870
That's right. I was the one who kept
saying I wanted to go to the hot springs.

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,940
And anyway, just being chosen from all those
thousands of postcards is magic in itself.

40
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,700
Thank you, Chipple.

41
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:33,960
Tsukasa-kun.

42
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,710
Oh, no!

43
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,580
What shall we do?

44
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,350
Tsukasa-kun...

45
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,030
Tsukasa-kun, put it in me. Hurry!

46
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,460
Right now, Chipple.

47
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,620
Inside me... Tsukasa-kun's inside me!

48
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,970
I'm going to cum!

49
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,240
Tsukasa-kun!

50
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,810
Cum with me!

51
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,180
I'll go out first.

52
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,700
You two!

53
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,910
It's a million years too
early to cheat on me!

54
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,430
Irene, what are you doing here?

55
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,430
Talk about having no shame!
Fucking in such a public place!

56
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,260
What are you talking about?

57
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,220
Don't play dumb. I heard all your
huffing and puffing quite clearly.

58
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,450
Liar! I didn't make any noises!

59
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,050
Tricked you!

60
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,570
I won't let you have
all the fun by yourself.

61
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,470
It's my turn now!

62
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,270
Damn! You stupid mortal!

63
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,840
Stop making a fool of me!

64
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,180
No!

65
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,440
There!

66
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,800
Hey you!

67
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,190
What were you doing in there?

68
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,580
Oh shit! Run!

69
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,400
Wait for me!

70
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,940
By the way, why are we running away?

71
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,330
Excuse me?

72
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,430
What do you think's going to happen if we ask
them to believe that a witch blew up a bullet train?

73
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,150
Yeah! And who do you think
they'll hold responsible?

74
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,580
This was supposed to be a nice
vacation for the two of us.

75
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,450
So, you just went to go off
by yourselves and fuck?

76
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,130
Well, anyway, we've got
to get over this mountain.

77
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,430
What happened to your magic broom?

78
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,090
I can't use it for a day after
I have sex. What about yours?

79
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,020
It'll be 8 hours before I can use it again.

80
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,310
Hey, I'm exhausted!

81
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,380
Tsukasa-kun!

82
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,840
It's okay. We'll be through
these mountain soon.

83
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,970
We did it!

84
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,580
Oh no! I'll freeze to death if I stay here.

85
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,330
Shut up! This is all your fault!

86
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,810
No, it's your fault for trying to
monopolize Tsukasa for yourself.

87
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,470
What did you say?

88
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,850
Listen, neither of us passed our
final exams from the magic world.

89
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,060
Remeber, we both have to get love from
Tsukasa in order to complete the physical exam.

90
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,900
You mean you haven't
given up on Tsukasa-kun yet?

91
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,320
Of course not! I won't let you steal him.

92
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,530
This isn't a joke! Tsukasa-kun's
heart isn't an object you can take!

93
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,950
Silly girl!

94
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,830
Do you want to fight?

95
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,220
We made it.

96
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,810
Hey, everthing's okay now!

97
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,270
Hey, both of you!

98
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,950
Man, talk about a flea-bag hotel!!

99
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,840
I wonder if this place is still in business?

100
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,650
I don't care, as long as I can take a bath.

101
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,590
Hello, excuse me?

102
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,130
I hate you mom!

103
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,710
Wait a second! Minori!

104
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,790
Exucse us...

105
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,420
Oh, we have guests.

106
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,500
I'm so sorry. Welcome to my hotel.

107
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,890
Excuse me.

108
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,810
We don't have any reservations, but
would you have some rooms available?

109
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,640
What's the matter?

110
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,080
Excuse me, ma'am?

111
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,390
No, it's nothing.

112
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,000
Excuse me, but who was that who
ran out just a minute ago?

113
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,380
I'm so sorry you had to see that.

114
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,000
That was my sixteen year old daughter.

115
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,900
After my husband died. I had to raise her by
myself and I'm afraid I may have spoiled her.

116
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,600
She's been associating
with a bad crowd lately.

117
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,520
I've had some trouble dealing with her.

118
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,790
Please take this room and that one.

119
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,350
Outside we have a hot spring
that we're very proud of.

120
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,990
Thank you very much.

121
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,240
Thanks!

122
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,710
You and I will be using this room!

123
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,660
Why?

124
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,700
It's not like I want to stay with you either

125
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,680
but I can't afford to leave
you alone, you rotten fink!

126
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,650
Go on!

127
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,760
What the hell?

128
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,870
There!

129
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,890
Please make yourself comfortable.

130
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,650
I don't have time to be entranced
by all this rustic charm!

131
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,280
I'll hone my beauty to perfection
by the hot spring!

132
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,820
And then, I will acquire Tsukasa's love.

133
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,650
You're a bit overconfident.

134
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,700
Chipple, I'll make you
pay for everything!

135
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,850
Hey, wait a second! Don't
go out dressed like that!

136
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,630
Man, she's beyond all help.

137
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,320
Here we go!

138
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:30,980
Now!

139
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,390
I won't lose against Chipple.

140
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,520
Watch where you're going, buster!

141
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,930
Dirty! Women are so dirty!

142
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,570
How can you satisfy Tsukasa
with such a pathetic body?

143
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,080
Oh, I wandered who it was.
You're as flat as a board!

144
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,540
Hmmph! You may have huge breasts and a
nice ass, but they won't win Tsukasa's love.

145
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,410
I've heard that women with really big tits don't
get enough blood circulating to their brains.

146
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,230
Oh no! There is a woman
with big tits there.

147
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,760
You bitch!!

148
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,810
You did it first!

149
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,630
What did you say?

150
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,370
What a nice hot spring this is!

151
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,020
What happened to us?

152
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,700
Maybe we have an allergy
to this hot spring.

153
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,380
Maybe we were in the hot water too long.

154
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,200
Are you all right Chipple?

155
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,890
I'm sorry I made you worry about me.

156
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,750
Are you all right over there?

157
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,520
Over here? I'm better than Chipple.

158
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,470
Here.

159
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,110
Hey stop that!

160
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,600
Oh, what's wrong?

161
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,210
Excuse me but I'm going out to cool down.

162
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,580
I wonder if she's really all right!

163
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,270
There's something wrong with our
magic. We can't use it properly.

164
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,290
You'll get over it soon.

165
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,800
Still, you'd better not use
your magic too much.

166
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,220
Why not? I'm a witch!

167
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,910
It's hard for me to explain real easily.

168
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:40,620
It's just that, since you can do anything
by using magic, you should be more cautious.

169
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,480
A witch without magic, what's the point?

170
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:54,480
Tsukasa's only got eyes for Chipple. I've got
to come up with something or I'll be screwed.

171
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,240
It's the boy I crashed into earlier!
He's cute too!

172
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,780
Wait a minute, jealousy is a
great weapon against love.

173
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,110
If I make a show of being really friendly with
this guy, I'll be able to get Tsukasa's attention.

174
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,130
That's it!

175
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,630
Uh, I feel sick. Can you let
me lie down somewhere?

176
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,970
Oh, it hurts.

177
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,660
As soon as you're feeling better, get out!
I hate being around women!

178
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,300
Why?

179
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,390
Because women pretend to be all
pure and innocent on the outside.

180
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,650
But nobody can tell what's
really going on inside.

181
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,510
Seichi-kun?

182
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,630
My family runs a hotel
in the red light district.

183
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,430
One day, I was taking care of the place.

184
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,890
That day, one of my classmates,
who I liked a lot, came by

185
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,250
and said she wanted to "work" there

186
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,780
Shit!

187
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,420
Thousands of brothels in the red light district.
Why did she have to come to mine?

188
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,120
I came here because of a broken heart.

189
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,140
I don't know why, but the boy
who dumped me came

190
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,930
to this hotel with his girlfriend

191
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,170
Irene-san...

192
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,710
Seichi-kun, not all women
sell their bodies for money.

193
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,970
Sometimes, when you're lonely,
you need this.

194
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,460
I'll teach you.

195
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,780
It's delicious!

196
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,060
More rice?

197
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,720
Please.

198
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,310
I'm really impressed
by such delicious food.

199
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,950
By the way, where did Irene go?

200
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,190
Irene-san.

201
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,380
It's okay. Trust me.

202
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,250
Yes, like that.

203
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,340
It feels so good!

204
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,170
Irene-san, I'll come soon...

205
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,190
Me too!

206
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,470
I can't believe the hot spring
water is their weak point.

207
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,780
Ma'am!

208
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,770
This is the men's bath!

209
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,140
Don't say such a mean thing.
I'll wash your back for you.

210
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,080
Uh, pardon me, but thanks and no thanks!

211
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,580
This can't be right, can it?

212
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,300
Ma'am?

213
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,930
What's the matter?

214
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:38,170
I'm sorry. Your voice sounds
just like my dead husband's.

215
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,540
It's been seven years since
my husband passed away.

216
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,620
I've been so busy running this hotel,
I've forgottån I'm a woman.

217
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,790
Ma'am!

218
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,600
Please, have sex with me.

219
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,280
Oh, Ah. But...

220
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,880
As soon as I heard your voice,

221
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,850
the woman sleeping inside
me began to wake.

222
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,440
But, uh...

223
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,190
That's so good!

224
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,920
Chipple, I'm sorry.

225
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,020
Ma'am...

226
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,080
Please call me Ayako.

227
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,630
Ayako-san!

228
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,040
Mother's an idiot.

229
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,990
What's more important,
this hotel or me?

230
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,720
I can't wait any more. Do it to me.

231
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,780
Is that mom? What in
the hell is she doing?

232
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,220
No, mom!

233
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,420
Oh, what is this?

234
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,490
I'm going crazy!

235
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,180
Oh, I'm coming! Darling!

236
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,310
Me too, Ayako-san!

237
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,260
I'm coming!

238
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,870
Ayako-san!

239
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,750
Darling!

240
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,790
Mom...

241
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,240
That was wonderful.

242
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,680
You may be young, but you're very good.

243
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,450
Ayako-san.

244
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,920
Don't call me by my name again.

245
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,820
This was a one night thing.

246
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,430
A brief mirage, an illusion
caused by the full moon.
