00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:48,760
Take.

2
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:32,637
l see that you thoroughly enjoyed yourself.
But we still have a ways to go.

3
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:37,465
Takeshi.

4
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:06,438
The Bizarre Cage.

5
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:12,502
The 2nd Chapter

6
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,841
Act 3 Thou Shalt Not SpeaK

7
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:34,023
<i>Currently all entrance gates are closed.</i>
<i>You cannot enter Fantasien.</i>

8
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,211
lts all right, now.

9
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:56,219
The exit is this way.
Please watch your step.

10
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:01,292
lt may be time-consuming,
but well just have to manually...

11
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:04,262
unlock all of them one-by-one.

12
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:06,989
After that, we can control them
from the Security Room...

13
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,558
directly with this cable.

14
00:03:09,903 --> 00:03:12,269
This is all thanks to Carmila.

15
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:13,836
Yukari, go ahead.

16
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:18,272
Thats right.

17
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:24,075

22
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,213

24
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:04,250
Damn! lt doesnt look like we

26
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:15,626
Hey, Kurumizawa!

27
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:23,174
Did someone call the police for us?

28
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:25,468
lts Miss Amano.

29
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:30,411
Saito, good job.

30
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:33,984
Miss Amano!
Werent you on administrative leave?

31
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:38,088
Anyways, l got a grip of whats going on.

32
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:41,758
Leave the visitors to us.

33
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:45,353
You three hurry up and repair the system!

34
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,858
Yes, maam! Leave it to us.

35
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,193
l leave it to you.

36
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:05,277
Whos there!

37
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,520
Let her go!

38
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:13,622
l will take her place.

39
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:41,820
You serious?

40
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,165
All right, all right!

41
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:09,404
<i>There is no need to worry anymore!</i>
<i>Please keep calm and watch you step!</i>

42
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,875
lve connected all of them.

43
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:15,414
We did it, Shimamoto!

44
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:21,352
Well, it seems that we were able
to avoid a disaster.

45
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:23,729
Good job.

46
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:29,062
This is all thanks to you, Miss Amano.

47
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:34,201
Thats not true.
You worked your hard, too.

48
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:51,555
Whats wrong? lts working!

49
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,417
Something on your mind?

50
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:56,789
The system revert back to normal.

51
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,031
Thats good to hear.
We can take a breather now.

52
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,765
Saito.

53
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:08,600
Tamami.

54
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,779
Dammit! lts not budging!

55
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,855
Yes, according to what she told us...

56
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:26,684
it seems that the missing lnoue
is located here.

57
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:29,458
Yes, with the other two.

58
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,021
Understood.

59
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:34,028
At any rate, we are going to search
the Castle basement...

60
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,627
where they are believed
to be located. Roger.

61
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:39,867
Are you sure, Yukari?

62
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,174
Yes. That basement is the only thing
l cant bring up on the monitor.

63
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:45,411
That and....

64
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:51,244
Not just Tamami, but l cannot locate lnoue
or Kitazawa either!

65
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:56,282
But that area was closed off
due to expansion, wasnt it?

66
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:00,553
Are those three really there?

67
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:03,987
We believe they are all there.

68
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:08,128
Tamami and Kitazawa are....

69
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,099
Shit! Hang in there, Tamami!

70
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,303
Yes, l understand.

71
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:40,762
A bit quiet here are we?
l thought you were going to please me.

72
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:58,981
That enduring face of yours is great.

73
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:03,653
Tamamis pussy was nice and tight.
How about yours?

74
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,765
How long can you keep that straight face?

75
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:35,083
Whats wrong?

76
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,987
Come on, more! Cry out some more!

77
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:52,097
Yeah. Could you clean this for me?

78
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:54,432
And dont you think of biting.

79
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:59,968
Thats right, nice thorough.

80
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:10,413
Well. You pretty good, arent you?

81
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:13,956
You suck Kajiwaras cock all the time?

82
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:20,528
Come on, keep it up.

83
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:37,109
Youre doing good. Just a little more.

84
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,825
Come on, swallow it.

85
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:20,021
ls someone here?

86
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:30,799
All right!

87
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:31,834
lt opened!

88
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:34,605
Lets hurry and find
Tamami and the others.

89
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:36,072
Let me go with you!

90
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:43,447
l dont want Masakazu to repeat
any more offenses l beg you!

91
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:45,875
Okyo.

92
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:50,244
l became vaguely aware of it,
but l didnt have the guts to ask him.

93
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:55,083
lts my fault! So....

94
00:11:55,728 --> 00:12:00,927
l got it. You guys and l go back
a long way, you know.

95
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:04,026
Thank you, Kazuko!

96
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:06,967
Now, lets hurry!

97
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,734
Okay.

98
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:42,297
Hey, where are we going?

99
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:55,345
This ways no good either.
Whats going on here?

100
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:58,950
lts like a maze.

101
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:01,152
Plus the wall and shutters
are closing on their own.

102
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:06,556
lts like as if we were
being led somewhere...

103
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,868
Well have to go back to that
machine room we just past.

104
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:13,668
lll try to access the main system from there.

105
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,042
All of the visitors have now evacuated
to the outside of the park.

106
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:20,375
There are no reports of any injuries.

107
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,042
Thats good to hear.

108
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:28,384
That, and l havent heard anything
from Kazuko or the other two.

109
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,600
What the? lts been overwritten?
No way!

110
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,213
Look out, Kazuko!

111
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:04,949
Sasazuka!

112
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:12,827
Sasazuka!

113
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:14,066
Sasazuka!

114
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:16,724
Okyo!

115
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,730
Shit! lts not budging! Shit!

116
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,235
Okyo.

117
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,872
lm done for.

118
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:31,776
Forget me, Masakazu.
Help Masakazu!

119
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:33,912
Sasazuka!

120
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:36,688
lf only l--

121
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:41,489
Thats enough, dont speak!
lll get this off you.

122
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:48,792
l didnt have the courage.

123
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:55,764
Dont let him commit any more crimes.

124
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,269
Okyo! Okyo!

125
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:02,003
Masa kazu....

126
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:06,911
Okyo!

127
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,405
Where are we?

128
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:35,713
This is where you will confess your sins
and will be punished.

129
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:37,714
What are you talking about?

130
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:40,308
Who are you?

131
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,188
lnoue!

132
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:48,987
What are you going to do with them!

133
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,356
Shit! Stay back!

134
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:54,565
This is the police! Give it up!

135
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,794
You cant escape! Let the two go!

136
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,867
lts over. Everythings over!
Because lve killed a man.

137
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:08,575
You murdered Makoto Kajiwara, didnt you?

138
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:12,547
Thats right, l killed him.

139
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:18,384
So then you planted that evidence
in order to frame Morimoto.

140
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:20,723
Thats what he gets for snooping around!

141
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,691
l dont think lnoue knows its a girl,
so l left it at he...

142
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:27,331
lnoue! Did you kill Ruriko Zaizen
and Sasazuk too?

143
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:32,503
Masakazu, Okyo is dead!

144
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:35,568
She fell victim to the system
you messed with!

145
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:41,039
Miss Amano, it connected.

146
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:44,239
Everyone is in the Sanctuary.
lm bringing it up on the monitor.

147
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,342
Kusakabe!

148
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:14,036
So there you are.

149
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:17,642
lve been looking for you.

150
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,310
This is....

151
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,315
Soichiro!

152
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:25,247
Thats right, this is Kusakabe!

153
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:27,756
See for yourself!

154
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:33,828
What, so you are dead.

155
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:36,197
l thought you came back
to life or something.

156
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:41,430
Then again, itd be impossible,
being all dried up like this.

157
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,933
You killed Professor Kusakabe?

158
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:48,975
Yeah, thats right, l killed him!

159
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:53,681
He started blabbering about MAOS
having some fatal error.

160
00:17:54,954 --> 00:18:02,360
And then he was trying to close Fantasien,
which just opened, to repair it.

161
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:09,463
l mean, you see? lf that were to happen,
wed have to pay a huge reparation.

162
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:13,367
Plus everyone, including me,
the middleman, would be affected by that.

163
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,204
Despite that, he--

164
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:19,670
Youre not going to change your mind?

165
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:25,112
l cant let that happen. But, look at this.

166
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:26,883
lts over.

167
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:36,721
Hes the one to blame.

168
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:40,891
He didnt listen to his friends favor.

169
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:44,734
No, Soichiro.

170
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:47,702
Hang in there, Shimamoto!

171
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:51,672
And thats when you got your hands
on Carmila?

172
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,241
Carmila?

173
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:37,879
ls your leg okay?

174
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:38,614
Yeah.

175
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,821
Sorry to bother you, but....

176
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:44,554
About this thing that lnoue was carrying...

177
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:47,393
ls it true that you can control
all of Fantasiens...

178
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,901
security system just by using this?

179
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:53,295
Yes, thats right.

180
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:56,697
ln other words,
you can interfere with security...

181
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:59,877
and purposely cause the system
to malfunction.

182
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:07,010
Well, the suspect is dead,
but l guess we can assume...

183
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:11,748
that this case was all set up by lnoue.

184
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:21,561
You seem a lot better.

185
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:24,197
Yes, well....

186
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:29,768
So whats wrong?
Calling me here at this time of night.

187
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:35,944
Youre going to visit Kitazawa, l heard.

188
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:40,946
Kurumizawa arranged
a special meeting tomorrow.

189
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:43,615
Theres something l need to ask her.

190
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,154
Shimamoto.

191
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:59,827
l want you to fuck me. Please.

192
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:02,937
This is so sudden. Shimamoto.

193
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,635
Just this once, call me Kazuko!

194
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:07,810
Please.

195
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:15,412
ls that what he called you.

196
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:20,656
lm not him. Do you still....

197
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:58,094
Kazuko!

198
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:01,532
Go ahead, lm....

199
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:30,885
Whats this?

200
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:42,233
But still, shes being detained
for an awfully long time.

201
00:23:43,202 --> 00:23:45,932
l mean, wouldnt that be considered
self-defense?

202
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:50,869
lf l didnt let my guard down,
l wouldve whooped his ass good!

203
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:53,873
l bet you wouldve.

204
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,242
lm sorry to have caused you all this trouble.

205
00:23:57,783 --> 00:24:02,618
No, its okay. Anyway,
l believe this belongs to you.

206
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:04,488
Shimamoto told me.

207
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,656
Takeshi, what is this?

208
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:13,793
Fantasiens system crash wasnt
actually set up by lnoue...

209
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,431
but was the fatal error
Professor Kusakabe...

210
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:18,834
was talking about, wasnt it?

211
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,743
So in order to punish him,
you and Kajiwara conspired.

212
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:33,340
Because you still love Kusakabe
to this date.

213
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,990
You found it inconceivable
that Kusakabe...

214
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:42,049
would just disappear without a word.

215
00:24:44,196 --> 00:24:45,220
Soichiro!

216
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:51,860
<i>Don't worry. I'm sure he'll understand</i>
<i>once I show them Carmila.</i>

217
00:24:54,873 --> 00:25:00,869
And then, when Kajiwara found his corpse,
you two planned for revenge.

218
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:05,742
lnoue, being played by the mystery
mail from the initials S.K.

219
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:09,413
Fell into your trap and dug his own grave.

220
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:13,316
You had lnoue admit to all the offenses,
framed him for the system crash...

221
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:16,757
and on top of that, you killed him.

222
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:20,388
Plus, in order to camouflage the fact
that it was a premeditated murder...

223
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:23,491
you became a victim yourself.

224
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:27,565
What went wrong was that
your conspirator...

225
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:30,335
Kajiwara, was killed by him.

226
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:33,275
No, it may be that you were
able to put up with that...

227
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:36,074
humiliation thanks to that.

228
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:39,784
lf Kajiwara was alive,
he would have stopped you.

229
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:44,054
He would never let the person
he loved go through that.

230
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:49,087
Despite knowing about you and Kusakabe,
he still loved you.

231
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:52,362
lll protect you, Makiko, no matter what.

232
00:25:52,831 --> 00:25:56,130
Even if your heart still belongs
to Professor Kusakabe l....

233
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:03,331
But, l have no intention
of telling anyone else.

234
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:06,367
lm partially responsible for this, too.

235
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:14,047
That day, if only l hadnt broken
the Guidance Display.

236
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:19,884
Kajiwara may have never discovered
Kusakabes body.

237
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,952
Or if Kajiwara wasnt the
first one to find it...

238
00:26:25,464 --> 00:26:28,900
This revenge tragedy may
have never taken place.

239
00:26:45,651 --> 00:26:49,644
<i>Welcome to the dream park, Fantasien!</i>

240
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:57,657
