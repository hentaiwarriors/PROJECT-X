Nymphs of the Stratosphere Chapter One

2
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,460
Take it off.

3
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,936
Come here.

4
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,243
I like this one better.

5
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,732
Look how wet you are.

6
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,039
It feels great!

7
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:31,971
I want more.

8
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,674
Forever...

9
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,380
Forever!

10
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,769
What's this?

11
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,574
Look... What do you think of this?

12
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,134
Move your hand.

13
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,369
Oh...

14
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,104
You have nasty juice
coming out of your...

15
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:52,187
Smells so nice. Smells like fruit.

16
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,527
Hold on, I'll give you something nice.

17
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,960
I'll make you feel better...

18
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,403
A lot better...

19
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,166
I'm not finished yet.

20
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,085
It smells so good...

21
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,795
Let me see your pussy...

22
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,053
Stop it.

Nymphs of the Stratosphere

File No. 49

25
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:35,945
Those eyes were full
of lyrical ambiguity...

26
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:45,887
...but they tempt people to
return to their animalistic origin.

27
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:55,397
The concept's
presentation of "beauty"...

28
00:23:56,067 --> 00:24:02,006
...oppositely located the
intrusive sense of value.

29
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:13,177
Not even a freckle.
White, white, skin...

30
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:36,905
The lips, as if drawn thin and
red, quiver only to desire ecstasy.

31
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:52,279
The body's flaw is not having a flaw
at all, reigned by the Golden Rule.

32
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:04,195
Is there a "soul" under those
slightly lifted swells...

33
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:19,039
...on either side that
persistently have peach nipples?

34
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:31,060
Bottom, rear end, buttocks...

35
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:44,203
Those words can't capture the...

36
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:52,007
...suggestion of noble,
round, twin hills...

37
00:25:53,118 --> 00:26:09,297
...with sweet fragrance
pouring out from the depths.

38
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:19,206
It is a sequence of the crystal
of unprincipled pleasure...

39
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:28,318
...no way to know the selfish moral.

40
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:36,351
Sleeplessly hiding in the darkness,

41
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:47,327
...sticking her fingers
in and out of there...

42
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:58,005
...stirring her fingers there...

43
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:07,381
...plucking her fingers there...

44
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:20,064
Here eyes filled with
curiosity, wait for nightfall.

45
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:36,083
Seeking an outlet for her sexual desire.

46
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,977
File No. 08

47
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:45,612
My apartment stands, overlooking
the park with thick trees...

48
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,959
...that seem to encompass the lake.

49
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:55,931
I live with my parents in this 5-room
apartment close to the top floor.

50
00:28:56,668 --> 00:29:01,833
It was bought when my father,
who's in commerce, living away...

51
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:10,273
...6 months out of the year, and
my mother is also never around.

52
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:16,586
I've been spending time by myself
since childhood. I attend a...

53
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:26,424
...well known academy that's located
one station away, since kindergarten.

54
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:34,596
I don't have many friends, even though
I've always lived around these people.

55
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:47,977
My classmates call me "gloomy", but
I never thought of myself like that.

56
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:55,355
I just feel it's stupid to be excited
about superstars and musicians.

57
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:05,562
It's probably because I have
sexual habits unlike normal kids.

58
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,910
I often walk alone on the
way back from the academy...

59
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:18,242
...to my house, which
takes about 30 minutes.

60
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:24,720
I walk through the park, towards my
home, but during these summer months...

61
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:30,557
...there are many couples
and doubtful people.

62
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:38,996
During dusk, I try to choose well-lit
places and hurry myself home...

63
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:43,329
...but one day, I saw a funny thing.

64
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:50,848
This person was perched
on a tree, like a bird.

65
00:30:52,183 --> 00:31:00,386
It was on a branch more than 10 meters
high, not holding on to anything...

66
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,187
At first, I thought...

67
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,463
...it was a boy.

68
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:15,534
As soon as I noticed and
stopped to take a better look...

69
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,775
...it suddenly disappeared.

70
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:24,609
I thought it fell from the tree,
but it seemed like it didn't.

71
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:31,383
I never saw a ghost, but
I did believe in them...

72
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:37,022
...so I was excited because
I thought "I saw it!"

73
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:45,496
Because this person was really
beautiful, I wasn't scared...

74
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:55,544
In fact, it seemed like she was
emitting a warm, welcoming feeling.

75
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:05,616
A few days later, I was walking
home from school as usual...

76
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:11,153
...a little late in the day because
I was doing research at the library.

77
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:16,156
It was Friday, and there
were many couples...

78
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,832
...some of them making
noises in the dark...

79
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,332
That's when I saw it.

80
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:31,778
I don't know why I looked that
way, but I was drawn to it.

81
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:38,752
It was perched on a tree,
at the edge of the park.

82
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:46,660
I quickly hurried home.

83
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,333
At that angle, I could probably
see it from the balcony.

84
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:57,532
I ran into the empty room and
without switching the light on...

85
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:01,541
...I took my father's
electric binoculars,

86
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,140
...impatiently adjusting the zoom and
brightness, I ran out to the balcony.

87
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,718
I can see!

88
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:16,850
As I thought, the treetops were
blocking it a little, but there it was.

89
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:23,594
At first, I didn't
know what it was doing.

90
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:30,531
But, I've never been
this surprised in my life.

91
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:37,277
Because, like before, it
was high up in a tree...

92
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:44,617
...sitting, with its shorts
down, showing its butt.

93
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,823
And it was sticking its
fingers in and out of it.

94
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:57,224
It wasn't peeing...

95
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:05,501
...but a good amount of sticky liquid
was flowing out onto the branch.

96
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:11,112
The cute face was a little flushed...

97
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:17,014
...and you could almost hear the
sighs from her quivering lips.

98
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:25,188
And I noticed this being
was intently watching...

99
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:31,862
...a couple having sex.

100
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,399
She...

101
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,200
I'm sure it was a girl...

102
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:47,482
So she was on a tree,
peeping, satisfying herself?

103
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:58,490
And, when her panting lips looked
like she was going to come...

104
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:11,271
...the hat she had on floated up, and
from around her ears, appeared wings.

105
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:17,878
The wings opened up slowly...

106
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:24,818
...as if a young bird was about
the fly for the first time.

107
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:33,688
And she again disappeared.

108
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,097
What is she?

109
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,800
Where did she come from?

110
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:54,149
I, in many ways, don't
know anything about men.

111
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:59,584
And, I'm not even interested.

112
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,824
I want her.

113
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:15,337
File No. 72

114
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:29,983
The milky white mist, obeying its own
will, blankets the building's corners.

115
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:37,924
Even the creatures that were
ejected from the surface of ethics...

116
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:43,465
...which is called the
non-directivity of sexual desire...

117
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:51,106
...lacking in consequence,
mumbles while...

118
00:36:51,309 --> 00:37:03,483
...they slowly get sucked in,
from the drain to the sewage.

119
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:17,227
The indifference of everyday life,
gives birth to the essence of collapse.

120
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:23,499
An illusion of being able to spin the...

121
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:28,535
...indulgence of one's own
original sin through knowledge.

122
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:43,527
The small delight from belonging to
someone is against a fragile appearance...

123
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:52,762
...only to form the affirmation
as a kind, that's a metaphor.

124
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,602
The shade of buildings...

125
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,678
The top of a tree in the forest...

126
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,210
The corner of a shed...

127
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:13,680
It's waiting for
nightfall in the shadow.

128
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:23,323
It appears from the maturity of
civilization and the boredom of culture.

129
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:31,597
Together with a vulgar scent of fruit...

130
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,239
Nymphs of Stratosphere
