1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,640
<i>No need to worry.
No abnormalities anywhere.</i>

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,110
<i>She is our precious original.</i>

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,680
<i>It would be a problem
if anything happened.</i>

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,280
<i>It is about time to introduce Joe.</i>

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,280
<i>Otherwise it would be disastrous
to the Megaro Earth Project.</i>

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,320
<i>Too many accidents this time.</i>

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,950
<i>There are elements beyond our control.</i>

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,590
<i>Impossible.</i>

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,600
<i>Everything is moving on as programmed.</i>

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,830
<i>Could there be something
to do with the small fuzzy elements?</i>

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,370
<i>They have only one way
to interrupt into this side.</i>

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,500
<i>That room in the Social Report Company.</i>

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,710
<i>It may become necessary to
terminate the scenario.</i>

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,600
<i>In 2030 A.D...</i>

15
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,110
<i>...nuclear war broke out
over the environmental pollution issue.</i>

16
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,300
<i>Many people lost their lives...</i>

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,510
<i>...as did most living things.</i>

18
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,810
<i>People who survived on this barren earth...</i>

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,460
<i>...started a project
to save human existence:</i>

20
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:45,430
<i>the Megaro Earth Project,
our last hope for survival.</i>

21
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,870
<i>And this city was supposed to be
the key for this project.</i>

22
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,820
Sniper Control Office

23
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,650
What are you doing? l'll sue you!

24
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,930
Stop acting spoiled!

25
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,760
Black Widows don't have human rights.

26
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,960
You want friends?

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,470
- Show her.
-Yes, sir.

28
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,650
l don't know anything.

29
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,210
Really.

30
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,360
Believe me, l'm not lying.

31
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,090
Please.

32
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,690
That girl was quite strong willed.

33
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,430
But now she talks to the walls.

34
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,500
Now...

35
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,450
...tell us everything.

36
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,050
Hey, Parsley.

37
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,890
Maybe l wasn't born to be a Sniper.

38
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,430
That's not true.

39
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,270
El-san, you rescued me.

40
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,260
You were so cool.

41
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,340
l always lose consciousness
at the crucial moment.

42
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,610
l feel like l'll end up doing something irrevocable soon.

43
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,610
Besides....

44
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,910
Chris, Jose, and even Rukka.
They were all Black Widows.

45
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,720
l don't know whom l can trust anymore.

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,790
El-san.

47
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,830
You're tired.

48
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,530
l believe in you, no matter what.

49
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,900
Parsley....

50
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,210
l shall share with you the energy source.

51
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,710
Hey, hey, Parsley....

52
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,980
El-san, l love you.

53
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,250
Forgive me. l'm not a Black Widow.

54
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,920
What an unrepentant bitch.

55
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,430
What do you want me to do?
l don't know anything.

56
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,170
Still lying, aren't you?

57
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,510
Believe me. l'm not one of them.

58
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,680
No, no!

59
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,060
They look good on you.

60
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,070
They are gifts from us. Do you like them?

61
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,780
Are you excited by the needles?
What a slut.

62
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,820
Believe me. l'm not lying.

63
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,820
You look far from telling the truth.

64
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,090
ln which case....

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,530
We shall let you have more fun.
Until you wish to talk.

66
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,790
What....

67
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,670
Now, Natsuki was fairly tough....

68
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,620
l wonder how long you will last.

69
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,850
Yes, l have fooled Linda well.

70
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,810
Yes. l have already made
arrangements for Rukka.

71
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,420
Yes. Be assured.

72
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,960
Gimmick-sama.

73
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,900
Oh, no, Mr. Phillis is a Black Widow.

74
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,760
<i>l love you forever
This moment for ourselves</i>

75
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:34,100
<i>Now and then forever
ls beginning now</i>

76
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,970
<i>One by one l want to make our memories</i>

77
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,670
<i>So please stay with me</i>

78
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,310
<i>Moonlight and stars are shining</i>

79
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,250
<i>And my body wants their light</i>

80
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,490
No, no, Parsley.

81
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,760
You're liar, El-san. You aren't hating it.

82
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,420
Parsley....

83
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,100
El-san, l found your weak spot.

84
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,140
l'm telling you, don't....

85
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,350
Parsley. Not there.

86
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,990
There....

87
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,160
El-san, you're so cute.

88
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,760
Like you've never been touched before.

89
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,430
No, it's not like that....

90
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,700
You can't lie to me.

91
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,390
Parsley!

92
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,280
El-san, l love you.

93
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,230
Not there.

94
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,810
Don't do that, El-san.

95
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,450
Stop! Stop!

96
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,800
Lick me, too.

97
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,980
El-san, you're so good.

98
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,860
Something's weird, Parsley!

99
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,490
El-san, l'm coming with you!

100
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,720
El-san....

101
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,770
That's right. l did see Mr. Phillis...

102
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,530
...talking with Gimmick.

103
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,070
Yes.

104
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,810
Yes.

105
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,440
Yes.

106
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,580
l understand. Then l'll be waiting.

107
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,080
Chris.

108
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,450
Are you on the job, El?

109
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,890
We received an internal report
from the Social Report Company.

110
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,160
l'm going to check it out.

111
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,860
Geez, what a busy bitch.

112
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,780
Yes, by the time
l came around on my rounds....

113
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,340
Rukka. He must have suffered.

114
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,620
l'm sorry.
lf only l had made my rounds earlier....

115
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,460
No, it's not your fault...

116
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,360
You!

117
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,270
Everything is for Gimmick-sama.

118
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,470
What's going on?

119
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,880
Please don't look at me.

120
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,010
-Black Widow!
-Don't reach for your gun.

121
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,610
You don't care what happens to her?

122
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,780
No, don't kill me.

123
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,330
Now take off your clothes.

124
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,120
l shall rape both of you together.

125
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,930
Do it now!

126
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,270
How embarrassing, you are leaking.

127
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,950
No more! Help, please.

128
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,450
What are you doing, Sniper?

129
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,320
Right, that's good.

130
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,880
No!

131
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,850
-No, no, what're you doing?
-Parsley, how did you get here?

132
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,790
El-san, El-san.

133
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,130
Don't cry, it's all right now. Okay, Parsley?

134
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,410
<i>What do you say?
It's about time we interrupted.</i>

135
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,480
<i>Wait a little longer.</i>

136
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,210
<i>I'm analyzing El's behavioral pattern
up to this point.</i>

137
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,950
l'm sorry, l failed.

138
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,000
You tried to get your hands
on El on your own.

139
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,300
Gimmick-sama is angry.

140
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,810
Damn Kana....

141
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,280
Phillis. Who has done such a thing?

142
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,520
Wait a second, it's me.

143
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,160
Loris? Why are you here?

144
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,320
-Parsley.
-Parsley?

145
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,160
She cried and begged me to come
take a look to see how you are doing.

146
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,530
Did you report
to the Sniper Control Office?

147
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,700
Of course l did. But the problem is....

148
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,740
The Sniper Control Office has been...

149
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,480
Hey, Rob. How is
the 1991 investigation coming along?

150
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,440
-We don't have to do it anymore.
-What? Rob, you!

151
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,380
What happened to
the Sniper Control Office?

152
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,890
<i>-lt doesn't exist anymore.
-Who's there?</i>

153
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,930
-Gimmick-sama.
-Loris, you, too....

154
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,400
Gimmick, you're under arrest.

155
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,570
What? Not again!

156
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,560
<i>Ready for termination.</i>

157
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,490
<i>Let's give it a little more time.</i>

158
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,660
<i>If things go well,
we may be able to introduce Joe.</i>

159
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,770
<i>But what if we miscalculate?</i>

160
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,610
<i>We might end up damaging the original.</i>

161
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,610
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

162
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,240
<i>If it goes well this time,
that would be for the best.</i>

163
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,450
No!

164
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,340
-Hey, are you awake, El?
-Kana.

165
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,140
-What's wrong? Bad dream?
-Yes, a nightmare.

166
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,980
What's going on, Kana? What is this?

167
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,290
Your nightmare has just begun, El.

168
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,420
Or, shall we call it sweet dreams?

169
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,750
Loris. Then, Kana, you too!

170
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,200
We do everything
as Gimmick-sama commands.

171
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,100
<i>Now, l shall start your examination.</i>

172
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,110
No, don't!

173
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,460
Please, no, Kana!

174
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,630
Are you embarrassed, El?

175
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,460
Chris and my other friends
suffered much more.

176
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,740
You've been using this a lot recently?
lt's very fleshy here.

177
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,000
You should suffer just as much as they did!

178
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,580
But Chris committed a crime.

179
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,480
She tried to subvert
the Megaro Earth Project.

180
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,360
Right.

181
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,690
Now.

182
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,730
What is your favorite treatment?

183
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,670
You seem to be able to withstand
ordinary torture.

184
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,330
How boring.

185
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,410
lf you know that,
why don't you just kill me quickly?

186
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,110
l'd love to.

187
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,110
But Gimmick-sama has decided
to finish you off himself.

188
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,220
l wonder why Gimmick-sama
cares about you so much.

189
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,890
Kana, are you jealous?
That's embarrassing.

190
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,430
-Parsley?
-El-san. El-san.

191
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,930
While Parsley watches...

192
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,940
...you will be raped.

193
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,800
Finally, it's my turn.

194
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,310
No, don't, please, no.

195
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,520
Take Parsley away.

196
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,410
El....

197
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,130
No, no.

198
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,600
Don't look, Parsley.

199
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,230
Parsley.

200
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,990
l'm sorry, Parsley, l....

201
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,130
l can't anymore....

202
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,800
No more!

203
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,950
You came, didn't you?
l'm coming inside you shortly!

204
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,790
Bikks.

205
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,790
-Bikks.
-Let El go!

206
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,390
Damn.

207
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,790
l'm so glad you're safe, El.
l'm sorry l'm late.

208
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,670
Bikks?

209
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,900
No. lt's too soon.

210
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,140
l still have things to do.

211
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,990
No. No!

212
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,580
-Parsley?
-Die!

213
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,130
Gimmick-sama, why?

214
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,960
What does she mean, Parsley?
She called you Gimmick.

215
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,870
-No! You, too!
-Don't look at me like that, El!

216
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,280
l peeked into the central
computer at the Social Report Company.

217
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,240
-What're you talking about, Parsley?
-Don't move!

218
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,620
l meant to get you laid
with someone other than Joe.

219
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:48,220
But we're the only two people
left in this city.

220
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,990
Joe? Who is Joe?

221
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,860
Do you know why Bikks and others
have vanished?

222
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,500
What was l born for?

223
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,200
Tell me, El.

224
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,670
-Parsley.
-Stay away!

225
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,110
lt's all right.

226
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,320
l'll always be beside you.

227
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,550
El....

228
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,460
l love you, too, but...

229
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,900
l don't want them to reset me!

230
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,770
Parsley, what's wrong?
Get a hold of yourself, Parsley...

231
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,650
Parsley!

232
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,650
<i>Parsley Program, Forced Reset Complete.</i>

233
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,060
Parsley, Parsley.

234
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,300
What's wrong? Talk to me.
Please, say something, Parsley.

235
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,030
<i>This Scenario has concluded.</i>

236
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,880
<i>That was close.</i>

237
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,650
<i>We came close to losing the original.</i>

238
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:27,990
<i>I hope this will have no ill effect
on the emotional side of El.</i>

239
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,890
<i>I do not think we have to worry.</i>

240
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,490
<i>But we never expected the
Replicants to develop self-awareness and...</i>

241
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,560
<i>...revolt against us.</i>

242
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,700
<i>Well, it is important for them
to have many experiences.</i>

243
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,640
<i>Next time we have to
let her consummate with Joe.</i>

244
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,650
<i>After all, they are the
only two human beings left in this world.</i>

245
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:57,120
<i>Next time we will create
a more romantic scenario.</i>

246
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,360
<i>Until then, sleep tight, El.</i>
