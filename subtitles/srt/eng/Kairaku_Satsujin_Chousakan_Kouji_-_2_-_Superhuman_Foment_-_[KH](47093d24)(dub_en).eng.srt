1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,940
The burgeoning metropolis of Tokyo...

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,840
Of those who lurk in the
dark underbelly of this city...

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,410
...some cower in the darkness itself...

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,780
...while others seek pleasure to
escape the darkness.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,620
This man may very well have been
a victim of the forces of darkness.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,600
ln response to such unusual cases,
Police Chief Kanzaki had...

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,870
...gathered up a group of people
with unusual abilities.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,570
A man who regularly
risks his life in movie stunts...

9
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,270
...in order to forget his past...

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,210
...Koji Yamada is a
member of that team.

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,850
This loner of a man found some
happiness in his friendly relations...

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,980
...with a female neighbor and her son.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,820
Then there's Jun Takamizawa.

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,020
Also burdened by a sordid past,
she is one of the undead...

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,790
...unable to die as she exists
with the darkness of her soul.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,630
Koji was chosen as partner to Jun
who has the clairvoyant ability...

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,640
...to see the last moments of a victim's
life as she climaxes during sex.

18
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,640
The sex was supposed to be
loveless and dry...

19
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,700
...but Jun was mysteriously
aroused and...

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,270
...had become
emotionally drawn to Koji.

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,680
However...

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,080
...the anguished soul of Koji...

23
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,610
...who had taken the life of a
former lover with his own hands...

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,310
...was closed and unyielding.

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,680
Meanwhile, from the visions
as seen by Jun...

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,060
lt was clearly determined that...

27
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,150
...the perpetrator of the multiple
murders was not human.

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,760
But there were no further leads.

29
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,190
Also, their leader, Chief Kanzaki
had been monitoring the lives...

30
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,260
...of the team members
for some unknown reason.

31
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,000
Then there's the mysterious entity
that oversees the murder...

32
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,400
...and Kotani, the man
which the entity possesses.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,210
As Koji seeks to get to the
root of the first murder incident...

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,750
...a second murder takes place
in his own neighborhood.

35
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,880
The scent of blood takes hold...

36
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,220
...and causes Koji's abilities to
burst out of control.

37
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,980
And finally...

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,250
...the perpetrator of the murders
makes its appearance...

39
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,160
...it turns out to be a savage
and evil monster.

40
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,560
Able to metamorphose on his own,

41
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,460
Koji attacks the monster
leading to a fierce battle.

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,030
As Kotani lurks in the dark shadows...

43
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,970
...and Chief Kanzaki spying
on the subordinates...

44
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,400
...the work of Koji...

45
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,940
...and the sex murder investigation team...

46
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,710
....has only just begun.

47
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,070
Goddamn monster!

48
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,230
What are the twins doing
at a time like this?!

49
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,440
l can manage without
counting on you people.

50
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,940
This isn't the time for talk like that.

51
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,910
We're going to be in big trouble
unless you people power-up.

52
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,270
What?!

53
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,250
Thank god. Nobody died.

54
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,500
What's the matter with you?
Why would you say that?

55
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,120
Eventually we're going to
have to settle this.

56
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,360
Sooner or later, someone will die.

57
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,040
Yuta.

58
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,720
Good morning.

59
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,620
Good morning, Koji.

60
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,780
Where's your mother?

61
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,060
She just went home to get
something she forgot.

62
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,790
l see.

63
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,700
What happened to you?
Did you hurt yourself?

64
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,940
Yeah, just a little.

65
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,670
l was bitten by a dog.

66
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,760
Does it hurt?

67
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,240
No problem.

68
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,440
l'm a man so a scratch like this
doesn't hurt at all.

69
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,780
lt's just a little irritating.

70
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,980
A woman would've been
crying long ago.

71
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,620
l know that men have to
protect the women...

72
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,320
because they're weak.

73
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,310
Are you going to kill me too?!
Koji! Please, no!

74
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,980
l wasn't able to protect Yuki.

75
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,020
l could not save her.

76
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,950
What's wrong, Koji?

77
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,220
Oh, it's nothing.
Wow, you're pretty smart.

78
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,790
You see, l'm here to protect my mother.

79
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,920
l guess you have to take over
until your father comes back.

80
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,290
That bastard should never come back!

81
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,930
Yuta...

82
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,840
Yes?

83
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,810
Yu...Yuta.

84
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,280
Father...

85
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,240
l have to go to work now.

86
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,090
You don't like your father, Yuta?

87
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,930
Yuta.

88
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,660
Oh, good morning.

89
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,860
Hello.

90
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,730
So, you were having a
chat with Koji. That's nice.

91
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,680
Let's go, Mother.

92
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,810
Huh?

93
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,740
What's wrong?

94
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,180
lt's nothing.

95
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,680
Let's go.

96
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,490
l suppose.

97
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,750
Bye.

98
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,220
There's no smell of blood in here.

99
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,990
l don't want you to wear
yourself out because of this work.

100
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,500
Don't you worry.

101
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,060
l've closed up all the rooms
that may be a problem.

102
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,430
What's happened in the past
in this house?

103
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,970
l don't remember the past too well.

104
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,080
Oh, yeah, nice and wet.

105
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,260
ls that all the information regarding...

106
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,220
...Koji Yamada?

107
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,460
Y-Yes...

108
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,430
That's information
l already know from the monitors.

109
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,310
l don't think you have any idea of
what's expected of you.

110
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,380
Chief.

111
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,380
What are you doing?!

112
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,990
No! Please, no!

113
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,260
No! No!

114
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,300
Please stop!

115
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,770
No!

116
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,640
Huh?

117
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Well? lt's about twice the average man.

118
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,300
No... No...

119
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,410
You're exposed for everyone to see.

120
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,550
Let's have everyone take a
good look at you, right here.

121
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,880
Please stop.

122
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,650
lt seems like your clit hasn't been
properly stimulated yet.

123
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,190
lt's too perverse.

124
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,900
Mako will be stimulated
by leaps and bounds.

125
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,710
l can't take something
that's so big...!

126
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,180
l'm gonna die...!

127
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,950
This is too much...!

128
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,120
l-l'm coming...!

129
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,130
l can't even stand anymore.

130
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,340
Good work.

131
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,610
l permit you the use of the
equipment for 24 hours.

132
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,540
Thank you so much!

133
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,990
Mother, how is your cold?

134
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,530
Oh? lt's better now?

135
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,900
Thank goodness.

136
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,740
Listen to me, Mother...

137
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,280
My plan is coming along very nicely.

138
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:36,110
l'm sure that soon the world will
become just the way l want it to be.

139
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,450
Just be patient a little longer.

140
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,560
You'll be able to go outside soon.

141
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,200
Flowers, huh? Wouldn't dried
flowers be better suited to you?

142
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,410
l hope you're not mistaking me
for some kind of lover.

143
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,240
Don't be a smart ass!

144
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,750
Just finish what
you've got to do and leave.

145
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,840
l know that already
without you telling me.

146
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,080
What's wrong?

147
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,080
That's pretty pathetic,
at such a crucial time.

148
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,910
l'm just not in the mood.

149
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,590
Do you need the smell of blood?

150
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,300
All right then, l'll oblige you.

151
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,260
Hey. What do you think
you're doing?

152
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,360
Don't worry...

153
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,740
My body's been long dead.

154
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,540
l can stab myself or anything
else, and it won't hurt a bit.

155
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,150
l guess dead bodies don't bleed.

156
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,760
Don't worry...

157
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,320
l'll make you come even
without the smell of blood.

158
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,770
Right. Like you're any use.

159
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,130
How about with these?

160
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,500
Fingers aren't going to do it for me.

161
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,980
We can only find out if we try.

162
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,570
Stop it.

163
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,570
Come on.

164
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,170
lt's getting nice and wet.

165
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,810
Nice and juicy.

166
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,650
lt feels so good.

167
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,160
Good, isn't it. Say that it's good.

168
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,140
lt's...good...

169
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,570
lt's just pouring out.

170
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,850
lt's getting good and hot.

171
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,010
lt's so hot and deep inside...!

172
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,930
Yes, yes...!

173
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,210
You like it?

174
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,880
You feel it?

175
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,770
Yes, yes...!

176
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,350
l'm alive! l'm alive!

177
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,080
l'm alive!

178
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,430
Yuki!

179
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,490
l'm coming!

180
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,770
You know?

181
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,640
What?

182
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,820
Can you try again and see if
you get any visions?

183
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,920
Please.

184
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,350
Please leave.

185
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,830
How's the sex with Jun?

186
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,440
She's quite the special lady...

187
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,110
...you know, with the cold touch?

188
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,440
Gen...

189
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,680
Why doesn't Jun die?

190
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,390
That's a difficult question.

191
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,550
Let me ask, why is it that
you can metamorphose?

192
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,120
lt's the same thing. No one knows.

193
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,970
Jun has some reason why
she cannot die even when dead.

194
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,490
Hey.

195
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,360
Hey, listen...

196
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,200
Let's do that again.

197
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,790
Don't be stupid.

198
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,530
Huh?

199
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,070
l don't mix work and pleasure.

200
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,710
Good morning, Chief.

201
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,950
lt appears that Jun has some
special feelings for Koji Yamada.

202
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,490
More important is the issue of the ring.

203
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,960
We don't want him to know
about his lover.

204
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,860
l know that.

205
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,770
l want you to keep a close watch on him.

206
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,630
Yes, sir.

207
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,740
Nothing but bits and pieces of clues.

208
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,580
l'm sorry that it was of no use.

209
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,720
lt can't be helped.
He is a formidable man.

210
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,810
Not the type to
leave himself unguarded.

211
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,520
What's the matter?

212
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,130
Just wait a sec.

213
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,680
There's something in common
between the two incidents.

214
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,610
What?!

215
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,320
l see it!

216
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,130
There.

217
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,170
Yamada!

218
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,890
l'm sure he was the old man who
was looking at Kyoko and Yuta.

219
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,690
l'm sure of it.
l hope those two are all right.

220
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,160
After sending out the sketch
to the various police stations...

221
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,960
...we've heard back from the
police station in District No. 4.

222
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,130
Get there as fast as possible.

223
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,940
Mrs. Tamachi! Mrs. Tamachi!

224
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,830
Mrs. Tamachi left to go
to the department store.

225
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,970
She took Yuta.

226
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,010
Department store?

227
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,210
Are you sure it's this old man?

228
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,680
lt's not a photo,
so l can't be completely sure.

229
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,280
This face and the fact that
he uses a cane...

230
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:44,160
He looks a lot like the loner
who lives in the 3rd district.

231
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,800
What kind of lifestyle
does this old man have?

232
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,470
l've never really seen him
talk to anybody.

233
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,480
He just looks kind of blank. Like
there's nothing going on up there.

234
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,480
Maybe a little senile?

235
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,280
Maybe. But he's never
caused any trouble.

236
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,450
Come in.

237
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,810
Yes?

238
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,980
Where are you going?

239
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,710
Before there's another victim,
l thought l'd try to beat him to it.

240
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,220
We found that old man.

241
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,020
He's headed toward
Ginza on the subway.

242
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,160
Ginza, huh?

243
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,300
Mom, l love trains.

244
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,600
Really?

245
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,340
You're so lucky you get to
ride on a train everyday.

246
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,270
When l go to work, there are
many more people riding...

247
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,320
...so l get tired just with the crowds.

248
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,250
l can't say l like it.

249
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,510
You don't like trains?

250
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,320
Well, l don't know...

251
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,020
Oh...

252
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,720
Mother! Mother!

253
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,100
Don't worry. Lots of people will
get off at the next station.

254
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,580
S-Stop...

255
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,170
No... No, you mustn't...!

256
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,370
Oh, no...! lt feels so good...!

257
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,940
lt's so big.

258
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,880
l want it in me.
l want it shoved into me.

259
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,730
S-Stop...! Please stop...!

260
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,920
What's the matter all of a sudden?
You were enjoying it.

261
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,590
l'm about to come soon.
Come on, keep going.

262
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,160
Please stop!

263
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,810
Mother, l don't think this is
the department store station.

264
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,980
l know. l just have something
l have to take care of.

265
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,450
Like what?

266
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,150
Yuta, you be good and
wait for me here, all right?

267
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,520
l'll be back right away,
so you just wait here.

268
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,890
All right?

269
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,160
Mother?

270
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,530
Hey, check it out! She's pretty hot.

271
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,770
All right, l've caught up.

272
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,910
There he is.

273
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,950
The old man's sighted.

274
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,150
On the subway,
headed for Awaji-cho station.

275
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,320
Gotcha. l'll get ahead of him
so we can trap him.

276
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,770
You think so? You sure
we're not being suckered?

277
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,270
Don't worry about it.

278
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,640
lf some bastard comes around,
l've got this.

279
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,510
What are you doing? Hurry...

280
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,710
Looks like something
interesting's about to happen.

281
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,680
l can't take this anymore.

282
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,480
l don't care what happens to me,
but just let me leave this place.

283
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,020
How can you be so irresponsible?

284
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,060
You sowed the seeds for this.

285
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,390
l...l did?!

286
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,230
Hurry, hurry, please hurry it up.

287
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,700
Wow, this is incredible!

288
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,360
She's totally soaked!

289
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,310
Hurry, stick it in me.
Stick your fat cock in me.

290
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,500
All right then,
l'll stick my cock in you.

291
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,950
Harder... Fuck me harder...

292
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,090
What are you doing?
That's not going to do it for me.

293
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,420
Deeper, deeper, go deeper.

294
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,730
l've never met such a
dirty woman in my life.

295
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,030
Let's give her the time of her life.

296
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,830
Hey, let's switch.

297
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,180
Oh, yes...!

298
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,520
Oh, yes... Keep going...!

299
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,520
What a woman.
l've never had this before.

300
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,740
Hey, lady.
How about two cocks at once?

301
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,410
Yeah... Do anything you want.
Drive me crazy...!

302
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:30,590
lt's that man's fault that
l've become like this.

303
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,930
Keep going...! Keep going...!

304
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,580
Yes... More, more...!

305
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,450
Wait a minute.

306
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,520
l feel as though
l've heard that voice before.

307
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,530
What's the matter?

308
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,720
Uh, it's nothing. Let's go.

309
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,400
Yuta!

310
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,410
Hey, it's Koji!

311
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,410
Where's your mother?

312
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,540
She said she had something to do,
so she told me to wait here.

313
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,350
But it's been a long time, and she
hasn't come back yet.

314
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,850
Oh, yes...! More, more...!

315
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,030
Mother's late.
l'm going to go look for her.

316
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,290
Wait.

317
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,270
Listen, Yuta.

318
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,540
You're mother's not the kind of
person who'd lie, right?

319
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,240
l'm sure she'll be back soon.

320
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,680
So, let's just wait here a bit longer.

321
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,710
But...

322
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,180
She could already be on her way back.

323
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,480
What if you miss each other?

324
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,250
Hey, Yuta!

325
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,090
Yuta!

326
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,590
Huh? He's gone!

327
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,630
Hey, lady...

328
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,640
l'll give you my cell phone number...

329
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,940
...so, when you're in the mood,
you can call us.

330
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,370
This could become a regular thing.

331
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,710
Unlike your husband...

332
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,610
...we've got a lot more energy,
so anytime's okay.

333
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,450
Do l look like
l don't get very many men?

334
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,850
Well, you were sure lovin' it.

335
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,820
Hey, lady.

336
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:42,560
Let's get out of this place and
go to a hotel for some more fun.

337
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,560
Please stop.

338
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,190
l'm sorry to say this but l just used
you to fulfill an immediate urge.

339
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,460
What?

340
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,370
l've got to get going,
if you'll excuse me...

341
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,170
Hey, wait a minute.

342
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,740
Come on, lady, you've gotta be fair.

343
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:59,080
We do you a good service and
you just dump us like that?

344
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,770
l'm not interested, now let go!

345
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,110
Cut the crap, you nympho.

346
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,550
You really want more, don't you?

347
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,520
No, stop it!

348
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,020
Stop it!

349
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,960
Pl-Please stop!

350
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,230
What are you going to do to me?

351
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,930
l'm getting real horny
lookin' at you like that.

352
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,600
Don't fight us, and we'll
treat you nice and gentle.

353
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,070
l'm begging you to stop this!

354
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,080
What do you mean ''stop''?!

355
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,140
You couldn't get enough of it
a little while ago.

356
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,130
The sound came from over here!

357
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,360
Hey, stop it. Stop it.

358
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,000
No!

359
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,130
Hey, wait!

360
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,500
Yuta! Yuta!

361
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,300
Koji! We got the murderer!

362
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,110
Murderer?

363
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,270
Two dead in that toilet over there.

364
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,940
There's no doubt it's the same assailant.

365
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,910
He was at the crime scene...

366
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,050
so at the very least he's a good witness.

367
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,310
What a terrible thing.

368
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,720
Go, go...!

369
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,060
You said you caught the murderer?

370
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,430
Well, uh...
