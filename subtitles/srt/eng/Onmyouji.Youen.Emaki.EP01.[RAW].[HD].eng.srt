1
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,918
So it's been ten years now.

2
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,991
Miyamoto-sama?

3
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,203
My master awaits you.

4
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,621
Please come this way.

5
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,930
Seimei!

6
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,269
So you knew I was coming?

7
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,524
To reunions.

8
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,410
Back in the city, very mysterious
things are still happening.

9
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,913
You mean the body without organs?

10
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,457
How could...

11
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,918
That hasn't been released to the public yet!

12
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,878
Calm yourself.

13
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,422
You intended to tell me about it anyway.

14
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,593
But let's put that aside for now.

15
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,930
I want to deal with a different
sort of issue first.

16
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:36,405
S-Seimei! Who are these women?

17
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,826
Your work must keep you too busy to
have time for making love to women.

18
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,624
Consider it a little break.

19
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,127
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

20
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,712
I didn't come here to...
So, Miyamoto-sama.

21
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,546
So, Miyamoto-sama.

22
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,884
My, how amazing.

23
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,388
You're very well endowed, sir.

24
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,100
Seimei...

25
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,562
I didn't come here to mess around!

26
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,481
Right now, the mystery
I'm working on comes...

27
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,110
Don't hold yourself back, Miyamoto-sama.

28
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,405
You're already so firm down here.

29
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,036
Hey, you, can you please stop that.

30
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,871
Oh, Miyamoto-sama,
Hey, you, can you please stop that

31
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,958
I feel so tight down here.

32
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,753
Could you please pet it for me?

33
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,135
Mi-Miyamoto-sama?

34
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:44,973
Will you please tell me what is
happening to me down there?

35
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,517
You... You're very wet.

36
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,144
More!

37
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,607
Pet me more inside!

38
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,868
Well! Eiko-sama, you're having too much fun.

39
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,621
I want him to pet me as well!

40
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,834
Come, Miyamoto-sama.

41
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,877
Me too.

42
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,382
Miyamoto-sama. Over here, too!

43
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,638
Miyamoto-sama! More! Pet me harder, please!

44
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,639
Miyamoto-sama!
Miyamoto-sama! More! Pet me harder, please!

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,348
Miyamoto-sama!
.


46
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,894
Don't give all the attention to Bisho.
Be sure to pet me as well!

47
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,146
Miyamoto-sama!
Miyamoto-sama!

48
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,190
Miyamoto-sama...

49
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,736
Dammit, Seimei.

50
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,741
Oh! Y-You're so amazing, Miyamoto-sama!

51
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,207
My body's so hot I can't contain myself!

52
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,587
Miyamoto-sama!

53
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,259
Miyamoto-sama!

54
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,263
I feel as though my insides
are going to burst!

55
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,015
Me too!

56
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,268

(Matsukura Hideko Murder Case)

65
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,912
A murder, huh?
(Matsukura Hideko Murder Case)

66
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,540
That's right It happened half a year ago.

67
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,503
Matsukura Hideko was the mistress
of the mansion we're about to visit.

68
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,171
She was a widow in her thirties.

69
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,384
Ah, yes. I wouldn't recommend looking
at the picture of her body.

70
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,676
Too late. I'm looking at it.

71
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,678
Oh, sorry.

72
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,142
Her organs had been cleanly
removed from her body.

73
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:38,105
Then they were hung artistically
from the faucets in her house.

74
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,942
And the water from the faucets
washed away all her blood?

75
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,277
Yup. There were no traces of it.

76
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,904
I see.

77
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,239
See what?

78
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,116
Be careful.

79
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,367
Of what?

80
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,545
A-Are you okay, Seimei?

81
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,922
I'm all right

82
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,550
It appears that the other
person is also all right.

83
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,512
I apologize. I accelerated too suddenly.

84
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,805
Are you all right?

85
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,099
Yes, we're fine.

86
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,185
But why would a sober man
like you drive so recklessly?

87
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,272
That's hard for a police officer
like me to swallow.

88
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,732
What are you saying, buddy?

89
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,987
I wouldn't drive while intoxicated,
I swear it! See?

90
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,239
<i>Chuujo Shinnosuke.</i>

91
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,243
<i>He's a common drunk now,
but he used to be a general.</i>

92
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,538
<i>He knew the victim before she was married.</i>

93
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:42,002
<i>It's possible that he held a grudge
against her for rejecting him.</i>

94
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,045
<i>He's definitely a valid suspect.</i>

95
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,532
One piece, eh?

96
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:13,992
What?

97
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,494
Is something wrong?

98
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,120
No.

99
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,705
It's nothing.

100
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,341
<i>Pierre Francois.</i>

101
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,634
<i>He's a Frenchman.</i>

102
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,139
<i>He loves Japanese aesthetics,
so he moved into Hideko's mansion.</i>

103
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,477
<i>However, he did nothing but use Hideko
as a model for his paintings.</i>

104
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,728
<i>He was obsessed.</i>

105
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,899
<i>He seemed disturbed about
his own lack of talent.</i>

106
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,122
<i>Inoue Hiroshi.</i>

107
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,874
<i>He wanted to be a writer</i>

108
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,627
<i>but according to those who
have read his manuscripts</i>

109
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,754
<i>he doesn't have a shred of talent</i>

110
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:20,267
<i>Hideko apparently pitied him for
his difficulties and took him in.</i>

111
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:26,297
<i>If her sponsorship made him feel pressured to
succeed he might have wanted her to disappear.</i>

112
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,904
Those are the three lovers Hideko took in.

113
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,658
Each of them have their
own motive to kill her.

114
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,995
But I have no proof that any of them did it.

115
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,788
I see.

116
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,707
So?

117
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,501
Who do you think killed her?

118
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,712
Good question.

119
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:53,842
If I take into consideration the
strange way she was killed,

120
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:58,013
Pierre makes sense, because
ne sees himself as an artist.

121
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:03,768
But Inoue's suppressed screams could
have driven him to madness.

122
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,731
Those "suppressed screams" of which you
speak seem to be nothing but noise.

123
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,234
So you think he shouldn't be a suspect?

124
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,237
But then, how do you even know this?

125
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,531
Don't tell me,

126
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,575
Seimei, you already know who...

127
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,410
Hey, tell me.

128
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:24,456
Looking at the evidence, it seems likely
that her killer is the thrill-seeking type.

129
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,877
It's highly probable that a man like
that would repeat his crime!

130
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,714
Hey, Seimei, I'm begging you!
Please help me!

131
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,011
S-Sorry, Seimei!

132
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,225
Don't be deceived by what's on the surface.

133
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,397
Some things can be seen,
and then there are shadows.

134
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:54,736
Some are possessed by parasites
and controlled.

135
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,821
The shadows are where those
dangerous beings dwell.

136
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,327
Let me uncover the killers identity.

137
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,769
You must do it this way.

138
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,312
Okay? You understand, right?

139
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,330
Preparations complete!

140
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,183
A young woman's cooch-sake.

141
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,811
This is what men love!

142
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,231
Stop. You're embarrassing me, sir.

143
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,570
Wow, what great breasts! They're so perky!

144
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:27,620
Wow, what smooth, clear skin!
You're perfect!

145
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,539
Am I really?

146
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,041
Even more so than your late wife?

147
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,793
Of course you are.

148
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:39,424
Even the most beautiful woman can't
compare to a twenty-year-old.

149
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,633
I'm so glad.

150
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,721
This is directly above Chuujo's room.

151
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,931
And the other two are Pierre and Inoue.

152
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,851
The roof and ceiling are one
continuous piece.

153
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,644
We can see everything from above.

154
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,022
Take a card.

155
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,524
We will place a card over each room.

156
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,904
I thought I could listen in with this.

157
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,614
Do as you wish.

158
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,793
What's wrong?

159
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,463
Just think of me as a toilet.
Let it out fast!

160
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,968
Can't ya give a man a little excitement?

161
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,598
Aw, so you were holding it in.

162
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,494
You had a lot in there.

163
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,871
A young woman's water is sweeter
than any liquor in the world!

164
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,166
Hey! Take a look at this!

165
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,963
Amazing!

166
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,096
Well? Smelly, ain't it!?

167
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,099
That's 'cause I haven't
taken a bath in a while.

168
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,352
What's wrong? You can't take it?

169
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,812
Come on!

170
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,069
How's that?

171
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,620
Hey, now.

172
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,831
Take it all in.

173
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,381
Yeah, good girl.

174
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,967
Try a little harder.

175
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,975
That's good.

176
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,269
Suck it dry.

177
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,983
Oh, amazing. You've got great technique.

178
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,152
I can't hold back anymore!

179
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,533
How's that? Ya like me?

180
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:16,080
Now I'm gonna push my
balls into your mouth too!

181
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,459
Good! I'm coming now!

182
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,437
That was good.

183
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,398
You're the ideal woman.

184
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,443
I'm bet you said the same
thing to your mistress.

185
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,320
Of course I did.

186
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,864
That was my job.

187
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,908
A man's gotta say that
even if he doesn't mean it.

188
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,370
So you mean to say you tolerated
her but didn't love her?

189
00:15:55,371 --> 00:16:01,209
I'guess so. After all, I'm all
about younger women.

190
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,756
So perhaps you were happy when she died?

191
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:13,054
Because this mansion...
and her money... became yours?

192
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,225
And did you kill her for those things?

193
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,228
Why you sayin' that?

194
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:24,148
Nothin' good's happened since she died.

195
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,736
If she'd lived, she'd still be
here to take care of me.

196
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,739
I'm not even sure if I can
stay here much longer.

197
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,078
All the other freeloaders could
be plotting to kick me out.

198
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,818
Beautiful...

199
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,612
A beautiful flower has
bloomed on your breast!

200
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,992
And desiring the sweet nectar of your body,

201
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,119
a butterfly comes to you!

202
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,456
And this is your nectar.

203
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,665
No!

204
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,836
Ah! It's almost as if
a real butterfly is here!

205
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,757
My art has caused your body to metamorphose!

206
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,302
This is what I have truly desired.

207
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,304
How grand!

208
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,306
Real nectar is flowing forth!

209
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,268
My art...

210
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,897
has done this unbelievable thing to you.

211
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,483
Oui, my love.

212
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,901
It pleases me!

213
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,197
You see that art must be understood
not with the mind but with the body!

214
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:59,452
Please, my love, put more
and more art into my body!

215
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,120
Very well.

216
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,523
W-Wow! Unbelievable...

217
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,774
Believe it.

218
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:34,445
With this instrument I will enable you
to feel all the art that flows within me.

219
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,675
Its throbbing! Art is throbbing within me!

220
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,634
Exactly.

221
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:03,891
You will... become a part...
of my art collection.

222
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:09,063
Then have you ever thought of me the
way you thought of your mistress?

223
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,111
You say the same things as the police!

224
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:20,074
I do not see any artistry in death.

225
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:24,162
Art takes life only in the living!

226
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,874
I feel the beauty of myself in her.

227
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,211
So why would I steal that beauty from
her and display it around the house?

228
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,714
I could never do that!

229
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,968
I feel the same way about you.

230
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:43,389
Pardon me, my love. I mistrusted you.

231
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,603
I'd be honored to join your art collection!

232
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,479
Oui, Mademoiselle.

233
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,237
The only one left is Inoue.

234
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,864
So it seems.

235
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,456
Amazing!

236
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,794
I-I've never felt anything
like this before.

237
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,634
I'm already finished.

238
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,053
This is the fourth time.

239
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:26,682
I-I wonder why you feel so much?

240
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,976
I haven't come yet.

241
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,603
Put it back in.

242
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,106
You are welcome to everything in my body.

243
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,691
I know everything.

244
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:42,114
I know where you want to be touched,
and how you want to be moved.

245
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,199
I know.

246
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,911
How is that possible?

247
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:51,207
I'm both male and female.

248
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,711
That's why I know how to
give you what you want.

249
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,172
A hermaphrodite!

250
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,799
Hermaphrodite?

251
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,676
What's a hermaphrodite?

252
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,344
Half and-half.

253
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,888
He has both male and female sexual organs.

254
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,268
And the devil has already
begun to move inside of him.

255
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,828
Don't keep it all to yourself.
Stick it in me too.

256
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,371
O-Okay!

257
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,461
Move it.

258
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,338
And keep it in.

259
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,260
Okay.

260
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,772
At last I feel it.

261
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,117
Don't come yet. Hideko wasn't like that.

262
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:20,796
What happened?

263
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,591
She got too wet.

264
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,261
She almost returned to paper
form before his eyes.

265
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,181
So we failed?

266
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,267
He is the most suspicious of them all.

267
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,311
But I still need solid proof.

268
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,273
Then we have no choice.

269
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,985
I only use this as a last resort.

270
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,239
Did she get scared...

271
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,991
and run away?

272
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:57,833
I'm waiting for you at the
fountain in the back garden.

273
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,251
Love, Gozonji.

274
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,224
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm counting on you.

275
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,047
Your mistress was sliced up and
hanged from this fountain?

276
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,926
Who the hell are you? Who sent you?

277
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:54,014
Your late mistress used to employ me.

278
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,601
Two weeks ago, I received
a letter from her. She said,

279
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,399
"I can't forget you, and
I want you to come back."

280
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,110
But then she was murdered.

281
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,446
Well, isn't that a shame?

282
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,367
She also wrote about you.

283
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,871
"There's a demon seed here
so be careful."

284
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,331
So Hideko sent you to investigate, huh?

285
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,218
Good girl.

286
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:35,723
First off, how about we taste each other?

287
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,601
Sounds great.

288
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,455
That's right.

289
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,999
Down there too.

290
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,585
Did Hideko tell you?

291
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,406
Don't get too worked up from this.

292
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,535
I haven't felt much pleasure yet on my end.

293
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,997
I understand. Allow me to rectify that.

294
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,921
That's the way Hideko would behave.

295
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,484
S-Seimei!

296
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,717
I think it's about time I had some fun, too.

297
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,991
Miyamoto...

298
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,451
Leave now!

299
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,661
You must leave now!

300
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,747
S-Sorry!

301
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,459
I didn't intend to spy on you during
such an intimate moment.

302
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,503
Not that! Go to the fountain!

303
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,963
The demon is coming out!

304
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,772
Good. It's about time now...

305
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,904
Time for me to bury my
evil seed inside of you.

306
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,782
Here I come!

307
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,231
Wh-What the hell is this?

308
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,406
That won't work on him! Move it!

309
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,444
Seimen!

310
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,447
Wh-What's going on, Seimei? Are you okay?

311
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,115
Seimei!

312
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,200
Wake up, Seimei!

313
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:07,745
Seimei!
