1
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,330
Professor Ohse!
Are you there?

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,930
Professor Ohse!

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,870
Oh, it's you, Professor Kumehara.
You were out with a cold.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,810
So why do you have to stick
your butt in my business now?

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,050
Professor Ohse, listen to me.
You've already killed or injured...

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,550
over a hundred college students
and faculty members.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,060
You must release the hostages
at once and come out of there!

8
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,800
I don't know
what your demands are.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,520
But if you must
take a hostage--

10
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,190
If you must...

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,640
I, as a professor, will let you take
me hostage if you let them go.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,380
What a cheap, trite line!
Don't make me laugh!

13
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,320
Mitsuya, you carry a cellular,
don't you?

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,580
Yes.

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,190
Professor Kumehara.

16
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,160
Mr. Kamishiro, Mr. Murano.

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,530
Are you all right? Are you
the only ones released?

18
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,300
Hi, Professor Kumehara.

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,300
Professor Ohse!

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,200
I admired your
courageous remark earlier.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,110
Nevertheless, I'm not
as stupid as you may think.

22
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,770
Did you really think I was going
to fall for that trap?

23
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,850
Trap? But it wasn't!

24
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,290
Whatever you say, Professor,
but I need some sort of proof.

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,950
Proof?
What do you mean?

26
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,690
Right. We can start by checking
for hidden wiretaps and such.

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,320
Please take off everything
you're wearing.

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,030
But why is that necessary?

29
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,640
Are you telling me that you can't?

30
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,860
Does that mean
your earlier remark was a lie...

31
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,000
just a load of crap
designed to hide the truth?

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,570
I'm relieved actually.

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,630
It's nice to know that
you are only human after all.

34
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,440
The self-love obviously comes
first and foremost.

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,420
Fine! I'll get undressed.
I'll do anything you say.

36
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,720
But you must absolutely
guarantee the hostages' safety.

37
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,520
We'd better throw some light
on you while we're at it.

38
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,060
Enjoy the show, Inspector.

39
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,730
I don't see anything
suspicious so far.

40
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,610
Let's check your underwear next.

41
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,920
Mitsuya, that should satisfy your
concern; nothing more please.

42
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,820
I think Professor said,
"Everything you're wearing."

43
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,260
I let you off the hook for now.

44
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,830
I'll be waiting for you,
Professor Kumehara.

45
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,770
What do you mean? Where?

46
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,740
In the chemistry lab, of course,
where everyone else is.

47
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,280
What in the world?

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,280
What has happened here?

49
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,720
Thanks for coming,
Professor Kumehara.

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,490
Professor Ohse, whatever have
you done to these poor women?

51
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,290
Why the hell
don't you say something?

52
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,420
Mitsuya, you haven't finished
checking her thoroughly for the wire...

53
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,490
am I correct?

54
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,000
Not yet.

55
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,560
What do you guys want?

56
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,570
They all want to help with the search.
But can you blame them?

57
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,980
Finish what we started--

58
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,610
Shall we get on with it then?

59
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,810
No!

60
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,950
Stop! No!

61
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,350
No!

62
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,470
Damn, these huge tits are
gonna be a handful to search.

63
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,150
Mitsuya, you won't fiind
anything that way.

64
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,820
Yes.

65
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,510
Is that breast milk?

66
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,710
Oh, my!

67
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,950
Is that a physiological
abnormality, or is it the pills?

68
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,920
The pills cause a pregnancy-like
condition to suppress ovulation.

69
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,860
In some rare cases,
this has been known to happen.

70
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,160
You'd better watch those pills.

71
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,460
I wanna squeeze them.

72
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,300
Don't be ridiculous!

73
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,890
It's alright; go ahead
and squeeze, Mitsuya.

74
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,700
I understand that breasts get
painfully bloated from milk.

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,970
I'm not bloated!

76
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,840
I know about this.

77
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,710
When women get sexually aroused,
their breasts swell up.

78
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,810
I've heard my father say that.

79
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,110
Please stop.
I can't take it anymore.

80
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,620
Let's see how much milk
you can make for me to squeeze.

81
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,770
Are you ready?

82
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,440
I see your breasts are swollen.

83
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,880
Right, Professor?

84
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,150
Hey, it's not coming out.

85
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,220
Kinda tricky.

86
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,320
Is it like this, or--

87
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,490
Help me out, will ya?
C'mon!

88
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,090
I got it!

89
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,210
So this is how it tastes.
How sweet.

90
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,500
Your breast milk is absolutely
delicious, Professor!

91
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,420
Well, well.

92
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,230
Whatever happened to
the body search?

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,740
Here you go.

94
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,820
That's the last one.

95
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,330
It's all right.
Not much damage.

96
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,230
Look, no bleeding.

97
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,160
Pull yourself together.

98
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,260
Okay.

99
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,290
I'm sorry.
I've been such a bully.

100
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,470
Let's just forget it, okay?

101
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,310
We bring you a special report on
the ongoing hostage situation...

102
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,980
at Aoi University.

103
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,080
The bombing suspect barricaded
there has been identifiied...

104
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,150
as Yoshihiko Ohse, a chemistry
professor at the university.

105
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,490
In this program, we'll unmask
the man behind the mystery.

106
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,500
I see the media's already
having a field day with this.

107
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,550
Suckers!

108
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,070
Our researchers have dug
deep into Ohse's past.

109
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,660
And in doing so, they have
come across an intriguing fact.

110
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,440
This discovery led us to
a certain woman...

111
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,740
who may very well
hold the key to this incident.

112
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,940
We've obtained her photo.
Take a look.

113
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,350
She is none other than
Ohse's older sister.

114
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,540
She was also a professor.

115
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,650
But after engaging in improper
relations with a male co-ed--

116
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,820
Now I remember!

117
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:27,460
She's that slut who seduced him
with her filthy mouth.

118
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,300
She preyed on not only one
but a few others at the time.

119
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,030
What a scandal!

120
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,740
No! Let go of me!

121
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,390
No! Please stop!

122
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,890
No!

123
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,860
The incident came to light
resulting in her dismissal.

124
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,600
Her teaching license was
also revoked.

125
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,010
Naturally.

126
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,270
However, later investigation
raised the possibility that...

127
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,010
it might have been a rape.

128
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,210
Where are you going, Sis?

129
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,550
Since her suicide,
the matter has become hazy.

130
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,090
Sister!

131
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,950
- Stop it.
- Our theory is that...

132
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,150
her suicide was in defense of
the co-ed she was trying to protect.

133
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,600
- Stop it!
- What? That's impossible.

134
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,650
Stop it!

135
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,530
She must have reacted to
the negative publicity.

136
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,040
That's a bunch of bullshit!

137
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,200
It was <i>you</i>!

138
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,300
You people ganged up against her
and drove her to it!

139
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,040
Because of you, my dear sister
ended up-- she ended up--

140
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,100
Professor--

141
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,750
The fucking media, the police,
the ignorant public--

142
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,980
The whole world conspired
to murder her!

143
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,620
This sugar-coated idea of
"holy profession" is for the birds.

144
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,590
When something happens...

145
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,620
we're always the first ones
on your suspect list.

146
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,760
The police, the media, and
you with the victim complex!

147
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,930
You don't give a damn
about the truth!

148
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,070
I can't--
I <i>will not</i> forgive you!

149
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,830
Yoshihiko!

150
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,040
Yuo?

151
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,080
Sister dear?

152
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,980
Can't be--

153
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,650
But you had me fooled
for a second there.

154
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,990
There is something about you
that reminds me somewhat...

155
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,260
of my dear sister.

156
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,060
l--

157
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,000
Yoshihiko Ohse!
Can you hear me?

158
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,640
What the heck is going on?
What happened to Kumehara?

159
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,470
Is anybody hurt?

160
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,340
Answer me, Yoshihiko Ohse!

161
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,610
Oh, I get it.

162
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,270
That's how you knew my name.

163
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,950
Alright. It's so nice of you to offer
to be my next subject, my dear.

164
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,830
Enough, Ohse!

165
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,090
What are you saying Murano?

166
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,130
What's gotten you so agitated
all of a sudden?

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,160
Oh, I see.

168
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,500
Mr. Murano, let's see
how determined you are.

169
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,510
Why don't you go make love
with Yuo on the roof...

170
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,740
in front of the media?

171
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,980
Oh, no?
You don't want to?

172
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,520
I thought you'd rather
do it with him.

173
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,640
- Too bad. Mitsuya!
- Yes.

174
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,490
Will you do it for Mr. Murano?

175
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,530
- Wait.
- Yuo.

176
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,530
I'd rather...
do it with you, Naoto.

177
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,730
Yuo?

178
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,250
Yuo, are you sure about this?

179
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,550
I mean, with me?

180
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,190
Yuo--

181
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,870
Yuo--

182
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,000
Naoto--

183
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,340
Naoto, I--

184
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,810
Yuo, you're so beautiful.

185
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,520
Yuo.

186
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,520
You're lovely, Yuo.

187
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,630
I feel like I'm dreaming.

188
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,400
This is just incredible.

189
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,440
Yuo...

190
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,190
Beautiful.

191
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,360
No... I'm embarrassed.

192
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,700
You're beautiful, Yuo.

193
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,970
Oh, gosh.

194
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,150
Here I come.

195
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,690
Naoto... I--

196
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,790
Yuo!

197
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,460
Naoto!

198
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,480
You guys make me wanna puke.

199
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,550
Humping like animals
in front of a TV audience...

200
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,890
so that all the world can watch
with depraved indifference.

201
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,330
Hey, I know!
You like to be watched, right?

202
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,630
You don't get turned on
unless someone's watching you do it.

203
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,400
That's why you guys were
showing off, right?

204
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,240
- Mitsuya--
- If you like it so much...

205
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,840
why don't you and I put on
a show for them this time?

206
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,850
- No! Naoto!
- Yuo!

207
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,740
Mitsuya, don't do it!

208
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,680
C'mon, let's show it off.

209
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,660
Stop it!
Don't you touch her!

210
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,120
Stop it!

211
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,870
I'll show you
I'm much better than Naoto.

212
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,540
No!

213
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,640
I beg you. Please stop!

214
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,080
I don't care what happens to me.
Stop torturing Yuo!

215
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,850
Why should you have all the fun?

216
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,550
Is that fair, Yuo?

217
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,890
You feel so good inside.

218
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,420
It's so warm and nice.

219
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,700
Here I come!

220
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,910
No! No! No!

221
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,820
Okay, your turn.

222
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,450
What?

223
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,390
I can't possibly satisfy her
exhibitionist urge all alone.

224
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,700
They can help her too.

225
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,040
Oh, no. Don't--

226
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,600
No!

227
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,580
That's right. Let them watch.

228
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,730
I'm live at the scene--

229
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,900
What on earth is happening?

230
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,670
A group of male hostages are
assaulting a female hostage.

231
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,980
I have no idea what is going on
around here anymore.

232
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,680
No. Please stop.

233
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,390
Stop it!

234
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,270
Stop torturing my sister!

235
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,350
Mitsuya.

236
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,720
Serves them right!
All blown away like garbage.

237
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,630
I did it, Sis.
I really gave it to them!

238
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,420
Now as for the survivors...

239
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,100
I'm going to sell you
as slaves on the internet!

240
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,770
Come see the grand opening
of the cyber slave market!

241
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,240
Mitsuya...

242
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,530
Where have you been?

243
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,340
Oh, it really doesn't matter.
Here, shoot them with this camera.

244
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm going to play it live
on the Internet.

245
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,680
I'm doing a popularity contest.

246
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,550
The poll will determine
who's the sexiest here.

247
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,580
I understand...

248
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,020
Professor...

249
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,190
Shit! What the hell is
going on in there?

250
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,020
Inspector, it's horrible!

251
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,890
Look at this!

252
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,560
What the heck are they doing?

253
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,710
I hate you. I hate you.

254
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,560
I hate all of you.

255
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,310
Mitsuya, come here.

256
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,150
Mitsuya.

257
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,430
Tawa... I--

258
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:46,100
For the longest time,
I've been in love with you, Mitsuya.

259
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,730
Oh, dear.
You're acting like a baby.

260
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,540
I just wanted somebody
to tell me that they love me.

261
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,520
Since my mom died,
nobody has ever-

262
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,450
It's all right now.
You got <i>me</i>.

263
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,690
But Tawa, I did such a horrible,
horrible thing to you.

264
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,330
Still I can't help
loving you regardless.

265
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,290
I'm sorry, Tawa.

266
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,970
Well, what do you know.
A million hits just like that!

267
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,070
People, that's enough for now.
The hits are through the roof.

268
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,810
What the hell is all this about?

269
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,150
Mitsuya, tell everyone to
quit this orgy shit right now!

270
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,490
Mitsuya.

271
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,160
Tawa. <i>My</i> Tawa.

272
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,660
What the hell is going on?
What is this?

273
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,490
What the hell is this?

274
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,680
How could you? You shouldn't
have gotten so carried away.

275
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,110
Stop it,
you subhuman animals!

276
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,810
Don't you have any pride
as a human being?

277
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,980
That's it! I'll end it all!

278
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,590
Stop it, Yoshihiko.

279
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,460
Let's not do this anymore.

280
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,830
No way, it just can't be.

281
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,700
Yoshihiko, let's leave it at this.

282
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,270
Sister, is that really you?

283
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,900
I--

284
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,180
Sister, I missed you so much!

285
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,720
Yoshihiko.

286
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,420
Why? Why did you die?

287
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:51,620
How could you die and leave me
behind all alone in this crummy world?

288
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,720
I'm sorry.

289
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm sorry for leaving you and
making you feel so lonesome.

290
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,360
Sister! Sister!

291
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,910
I've been watching you.
I always will.

292
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,780
So you're not all alone.

293
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,450
Sister, I did as you said and
made those bombs you mentioned.

294
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,190
Just like you said
in your E-mail...

295
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,750
the reason you came back is...

296
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,630
because I took revenge on
those who did you wrong.

297
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,290
Isn't that right?

298
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,000
It was me.
I sent you the mail.

299
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,340
Mitsuya.

300
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,940
I was also unhappy all alone.

301
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:48,370
I study like hell to become
a doctor like my father says.

302
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,120
But that kind of life seems
so pointless and vain.

303
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,160
I felt I'd be better off dead.

304
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,480
So I figured to get revenge...

305
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,390
I'd provoke Professor
to make bombs and--

306
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,190
But you're not alone anymore.

307
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,300
I won't leave you alone
Mitsuya, my darling.

308
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,470
Yoshihiko, you must make amends
for the wrong you've done.

309
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,510
It's for your own sake too.

310
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,600
Every person has two lives.

311
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,240
One for living and one to
leave behind in people's memory.

312
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,290
The latter is eternal.

313
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,150
It lives on forever as long as
they remember you...

314
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,960
for all the good and bad.
Do you understand?

315
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,830
I understand, Sister.

316
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,340
Oh, no!

317
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:15,290
Over the forest that shines
in the afterglow

318
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,870
A bird dances about
drawing circles in the sky

319
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:32,450
Then it prepares to bury
its claw on a prey

320
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,350
As if carrying out
heaven's will

321
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:45,290
The pale moon lies
on the bottom of the water

322
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,270
It flutters a shell of gaiety

323
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,210
I'll drift aimlessly
at the edge of mystery

324
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:06,150
Only to arrive
at a defiinite destination

325
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,740
So here I go

326
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,690
The flower, the moon, the world

327
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,020
Mark my name, my existence

328
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,360
Mark them firm and deep

329
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,430
Mark them till it hurts,
so it can't be erased

330
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:34,040
Recognize the sacred love
in my name, in my existence

331
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,380
I'll take this ache and
turn it into pleasure

332
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,510
Such is the power of temptation

333
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:49,080
I am about to
open its doors for you

334
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,980
The flower, the moon, the world

335
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:12,210
Mark my name, my existence

336
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,520
Mark them firm and deep

337
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,610
Mark them till it hurts,
so it can't be erased

338
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:27,860
For you, I'll burn out
all the life that's left in me
