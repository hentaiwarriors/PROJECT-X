1
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:23,537
Welcome to Pia Carrot.
This way, please.

2
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:40,749
Let me clear that.

3
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:01,342
What are your plans for summer vacation?

4
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:04,005
Going to Okinawa, of course!

5
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:06,672
Yusuke!

6
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:12,117
You scared me, Satomi.
I thought it was Shiho.

7
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:15,124
No more dilly-dallying, back to work.

8
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:18,055
Yusuke, let me help you.

9
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:22,657
Shoko is so kind. Satomi is so mean.

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,096
No, Shoko.
Show no pity to this good-for-nothing.

11
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:30,702
<i>- But...
- Both of you.</i>

12
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:34,805
Don't just stand there,
you have work to do.

13
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:36,743
I'm sorry, Shiho.

14
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:39,543
Shoko, it's cooler inside anyway.

15
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,085
Yusuke, I'll help you some other time.

16
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,885
- Yusuke.
- Yes.

17
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:50,360
When you're done here,
please clean the storage area.

18
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:51,894
Sure.

19
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:56,994
What a way to spend a summer vacation.

20
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:00,366
Damn you, Dad!

21
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,737
You tricked me!

22
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:09,872
Dad, that's not what you said.

23
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:13,508
I promised to work for you in July only.

24
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:16,851
I'm planning on going to
the beach in August.

25
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,186
You were planning on picking up girls,
which you would fail to do anyway.

26
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:25,751
If only you'd failed fewer of your classes...

27
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:32,628
Bro, give it up. You promised.

28
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:35,699
Stay out of this. Shut up, Milk.

29
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:41,210
I'm not a kid anymore.
No more nicknames, call me Rumi.

30
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:44,870
Okay. Yusuke.

31
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,878
You will work at Pia Carrot
for the whole summer.

32
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:51,420
What?

33
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:56,388
And I'll ask Kiyomi to tutor you.

34
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,728
No.

35
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,663
My precious summer holidays...

36
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,208
Ladies' Dressing Room

37
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:24,209
Lucky.

38
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:32,862
Ouch.

39
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,818
Satomi, you're a bad girl.

40
00:05:04,494 --> 00:05:06,359
No, no, Shoko...

41
00:05:18,642 --> 00:05:22,009
Yusuke, you pervert!

42
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:25,546
Yusuke, are you all right?

43
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:29,616
This must be a mistake. Forgive him.

44
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:32,813
Shoko...

45
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:37,656
What's the commotion?
What did you do, Yusuke?

46
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:39,655
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:42,698
I saw a cockroach and screamed and...

48
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:51,574
It's true.
The three of us came to take a look.

49
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,207
All right.

50
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:01,782
Everyone, your break is almost over.

51
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:18,724
<i>Reika.</i>

52
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,080
What are you doing? This is my room.

53
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:43,523
This is the only room with a big mirror.

54
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,660
Don't get so mad.

55
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:49,790
Hey, Bro, let's go to the Summer Festival.

56
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,127
With you?

57
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:58,967
I've invited Satomi and Shoko, too.

58
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:05,204
Well. It might be not
a bad idea to go out with you.

59
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:07,079
Really? Great.

60
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:10,546
I'm not that bad, am I?

61
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:14,048
<i>Yeah, you look good in that yukata.</i>

62
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:40,416
We haven't been to
the Festival in a long time.

63
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:41,780
Yeah.

64
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:55,086
- Here we are.
- Shoko, we've been waiting for you.

65
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:01,564
Can't refuse Rumi.

66
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:03,104
Wow.

67
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:46,037
Hey, isn't that your father?

68
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:54,555
Dad.

69
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:58,021
Surprise. We underestimated Dad.

70
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:01,562
- Didn't we, Rumi?
- Well, yeah.

71
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:20,841
Yusuke, take the trash on your way out.

72
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:26,148
- Do it yourself.
- Hey, hey, do it.

73
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:35,062
Shit. Satomi's a bitch.

74
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:40,665
Anyone there?

75
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,500
Reika.

76
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:57,182
- Don't worry, it's nothing.
- Nothing?

77
00:09:57,687 --> 00:10:00,349
- You like me, don't you?
- Well...

78
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:06,693
That's too bad.
I have weakness for kind boys.

79
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:11,095
Yusuke, do you have a girlfriend?

80
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:14,529
No. Nobody special.

81
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,537
What about me?

82
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:26,209
Please. You're toying with me.

83
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:54,933
<i>Reika.</i>

84
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:01,175
What are you going to do, Yusuke?

85
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:04,687
You might not graduate high school.

86
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:07,479
I study everyday.

87
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:12,557
You're a mess.
I'm embarrassed to face your father.

88
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:17,565
Maybe I need to stick to your side
and watch after you.

89
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:21,701
I'd be glad if you'd watch after me for life.

90
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,830
Kiyomi, marry me.

91
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:35,444
Too bad, I will only marry a worthy man.

92
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,823
- Miss Kitagawa, don't be so mean.
- Bro's bothering Kiyomi again.

93
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:46,993
Yusuke, why are you so wishy-washy?

94
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,991
What are you girls doing here?

95
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:53,629
You have to go to work this afternoon.

96
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:56,171
Go on. Move.

97
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:08,182
This is heaven.

98
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:13,519
What are you staring at?

99
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:20,628
- Stop, please, stop.
- Die, die!

100
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,169
What a day.

101
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:34,037
Hey, Yusuke.

102
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:37,541
Have you thought about it?

103
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:40,748
Don't toy with me, Reika.

104
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:44,152
I don't mean to.

105
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:49,552
Watch out.

106
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:54,589
Don't let go of me. I'm falling!

107
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,866
Are you all right?

108
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:11,403
Reika.

109
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:15,080
Thank you for saving me.

110
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,527
Oh. I can't...

111
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:28,429
Ever felt a breast before?

112
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,289
No, no.

113
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:36,164
Be gentle.

114
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:47,272
<i>Yusuke.</i>

115
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,981
Where are you? Are you in there?

116
00:13:52,055 --> 00:13:53,852
There you are.

117
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,224
I've been looking for you.

118
00:13:57,594 --> 00:14:00,028
Let's go to lunch together.

119
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:04,428
Yusuke, wait up.

120
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,286
Kiyomi.

121
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:27,622
- Let's have tea.
- Thanks.

122
00:14:28,758 --> 00:14:31,852
Yusuke, finish that quiz, then come down.

123
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:33,595
Okay.

124
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:38,056
Reika.

125
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,903
<i>What if Shoko hadn't barged in...</i>

126
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,409
<i>- It's about time for Yusuke.
- I see.</i>

127
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,714
We can't keep him the way it is.
Okay, let's do that.

128
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:04,583
Yusuke.

129
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:09,364
- What're you doing?
- Nothing.

130
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,434
Yusuke, speak of the devil.

131
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:16,361
We've been talking about you.

132
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:18,533
About me?

133
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:21,907
Shiho and I have decided...

134
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:27,045
...it's about time you waited tables.

135
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:31,350
- Good for you, Yusuke.
- I don't want it.

136
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:35,755
I know you got something up
your sleeve, Dad.

137
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:40,422
Shiho will notify you tomorrow.

138
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:43,761
This is an order from your employer.

139
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:56,507
Yusuke, do you need a hand?

140
00:15:58,047 --> 00:15:59,571
Thanks.

141
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:03,213
But I'm almost done. Don't worry.

142
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:08,285
- Can I call you tonight?
- Yeah, sure.

143
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:12,821
Then I'll talk to you tonight. Good night.

144
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:16,754
Reika.

145
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:19,960
Shoko's cute. I'm getting jealous.

146
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:22,262
It's not like that.

147
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:25,098
I like-

148
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:28,668
No, you can't talk to a girl like that.

149
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:36,776
Maybe I should wait for you in the park.

150
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,320
But maybe you won't come.

151
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,490
So you came for me after all.

152
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:23,729
I didn't think you would.

153
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,792
Why not?

154
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:30,194
Well...

155
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:39,113
You're not busy?

156
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:41,714
No.

157
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:45,147
I like you, Yusuke.

158
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:53,959
You don't want to go out with me?

159
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:56,927
But why me?

160
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,963
You're toying with me.

161
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:03,505
I see. That's how it seems.

162
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,843
Tell the truth.
You don't want to go out with me.

163
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:16,442
That's not true. You're beautiful, and...

164
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:23,984
- Reika.
- Yusuke. I...

165
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,629
I...

166
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,812
Sorry to keep you waiting.

167
00:19:56,986 --> 00:20:00,046
You're surprisingly manly.

168
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:02,223
Am I?

169
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,727
Stay like this.

170
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:11,361
It keeps me calm.

171
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:18,530
I've always wanted manly men.

172
00:20:24,046 --> 00:20:26,071
Reika, that is...

173
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:30,650
You're getting manly down there.

174
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:39,317
<i>Hello? Hi, Shoko.</i>

175
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:43,428
Bro? He's not back yet.

176
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,799
Okay, bye.

177
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:54,599
Reika.

178
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:39,150
No. I can't hold back.

179
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:42,216
I want you inside me.

180
00:21:58,574 --> 00:22:03,136
Reika. I love you, Reika.

181
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:05,145
Wait.

182
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:12,282
Yusuke. You're crushing me.

183
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:15,117
I'm sorry.

184
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:20,422
It's all right. But be gentle with a girl.

185
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:23,864
Okay.

186
00:22:55,264 --> 00:22:57,027
Good. Go on.

187
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:37,064
Are you all right, Reika?

188
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:43,707
Yes. It was wonderful.
Now let's use your tool.

189
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:46,381
Okay.

190
00:23:53,756 --> 00:23:55,223
Oops.

191
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:59,056
That's strange.

192
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,327
Don't worry,
everyone's like that the first time.

193
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:11,330
Right here. Here.

194
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:21,415
You're so warm.

195
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:24,375
Reika.

196
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:29,019
Breathe deep.

197
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:32,727
Good, go slow.

198
00:25:03,626 --> 00:25:06,720
Good. Harder.

199
00:25:23,912 --> 00:25:25,937
Reika, I can't...

200
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:33,918
Good, go ahead. Come inside me.

201
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:17,161
<i>Good morning.</i>

202
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:21,496
Good morning, Yusuke.

203
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:33,713
Wait up, Yusuke. I called you last night.

204
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:38,115
Sorry, I ran into a friend on my way home.

205
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:44,818
Good morning, Reika.

206
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:46,756
Good morning.

207
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:56,968
She's getting busy with her school work.

208
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,269
This will be her last week.

209
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:01,499
No way.

210
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:03,868
Yusuke?

211
00:27:07,516 --> 00:27:09,313
Good morning.

212
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:13,411
Yusuke, what're you daydreaming about?
