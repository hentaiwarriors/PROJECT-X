1
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,127
I'll take this one.

2
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:12,622
Thank you very much.

3
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:15,092
This is a very good find.

4
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:17,933
I'm glad you like it, sir.

5
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:37,046
Slave Market
(Dorei Ichiba)

6
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,559
The city of Constantinovale
lies across the ocean,

7
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:44,988
under a blue sky
clear of a single cloud.

8
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:51,128
A pagan city shining in the sun.
A stage for shocking dramas.

9
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:57,039
I, Casius Gile Palvis, received an
urgent mission from my country,

10
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:03,214
and was dispatched to Constaninovale,
an enemy nation, in 1618.

11
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:08,615
The first time I visited this
foreign land's capital, I saw...

12
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:24,565
Casius!

13
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,240
Casius, over here!

14
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:29,608
Falco!

15
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:36,841
How have you been? It's been
how long since I've seen you?

16
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:41,446
2 years. I haven't seen you
since you visited my country!

17
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:44,749
But I didn't think you'd
come out here to meet me.

18
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:50,089
A friend I haven't seen in a while
is visiting my city. My backyard!

19
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:52,494
Of course I'm going to come meet you.

20
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:54,294
I appreciate it.

21
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,768
But you know, you really...

22
00:02:57,003 --> 00:03:00,097
The young man in front of me,
blessed with the looks of the Gods,

23
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:03,069
has also been blessed by Hermes
with a knack for business.

24
00:03:03,776 --> 00:03:08,475
He became a merchant to the
government and achieved his wealth.

25
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:13,750
Falco, there's a lot to talk about,
but the mission comes first.

26
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,784
Actually, there's somewhere
I want to show you, first.

27
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,522
B-but the embassy...

28
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,422
We can do that later. I want to
show you something interesting.

29
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,564
Interesting?

30
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:31,571
Yeah. It embodies
everything in this town.

31
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,404
It has everything.
But you also can lose everything.

32
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:37,974
It's the dirtiest and noblest institution
in this town at the same time.

33
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:03,202
Everyone, out!

34
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,308
How do you like them?

35
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:18,046
Are there any items
that catch your fancy?

36
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,352
H-hey, Falco, what is this?

37
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:24,524
The slave market. Here, money is
all that matters, and you can...

38
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:27,960
do whatever you want.
Isn't this a great town?

39
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:29,228
W-wait a minute.

40
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:33,261
You wouldn't deny your old friend
a chance to be hospitable, right?

41
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:37,058
If you don't like girls, we can
always buy you a nice boy.

42
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:39,596
Q-quit teasing me.

43
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:43,567
I was at a loss for words at
the sight of such immorality.

44
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,411
The scent of prison came
wafting from the women.

45
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:51,749
The light had gone out from
their eyes, unable to even suffer.

46
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:57,549
Bianca! Quit hiding in the back
and show your face to the man!

47
00:04:58,224 --> 00:05:03,560
Oh! Brother!
Brother, did you come to pick me up?

48
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:05,759
Brother? Me?

49
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,803
Bianca is a spoil of war
gotten from Romania.

50
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:16,071
Her skin, her hair color,
and those shining eyes.

51
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:22,781
I swear by the Parthenon that
she is from noble birth, indeed!

52
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:28,053
Casius, it's easier to keep it simple.
How old is she?

53
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,612
She is 19, sir.

54
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:34,059
19, eh? That's a good age.

55
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:36,558
T-that tickles!

56
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:42,825
Look at that translucent skin.
It's like she's never seen the sun.

57
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:48,539
This is an incredible find.

58
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:50,037
No!

59
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:52,773
And the feel of her flesh...

60
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:57,107
How about it?
You want to test her?

61
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,351
N-no, that's okay.

62
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:07,317
H-hey, aren't you going too far?

63
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,191
N-no more!
I don't want to! Stop!!

64
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:15,961
Brother... it hurts!

65
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:18,067
Hey!
No violence!

66
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:22,802
Please pardon us.
But you must be firm with a slave.

67
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:24,267
That's enough.

68
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,043
Brother...

69
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:32,341
From now on, this woman is my slave.
Don't handle her roughly!

70
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:35,353
Oh, an excellent choice, sir!

71
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:38,653
I am most humbly grateful for a fine
Venetian gentleman like you...

72
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:44,591
to be doing business with
a lowly merchant like myself.

73
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,563
Seems like you made a good purchase.

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,968
Don't misunderstand. I...

75
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:52,404
I understand.

76
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,813
So, are you going to pretend to be a
rock all day? If that's the case,

77
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:03,145
you've probably forgotten about
the mission too, haven't you?

78
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:09,114
Sorry. I think seeing that as the
first thing was a bit of a shock.

79
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:14,689
It's better to get to know the city
before you get burnt, right?

80
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,132
It's a small house, but it's got
everything you might need.

81
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:23,297
Use it however you want.

82
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:27,468
It's even got a nice yard.

83
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:35,880
Thanks. It's heaven compared to
the barracks. Too big for just me.

84
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:42,277
Did you think that you went
and bought some air before?

85
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,920
This is going to be your room.

86
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:52,960
Falco, there's something
I just have to ask.

87
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:54,563
What is it?

88
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:58,662
Is the war...
really going to happen?

89
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:06,374
Unfortunately, yes.
War is a giant wheel.

90
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:09,247
Once you get it started,
you can't stop it.

91
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:10,345
I see...

92
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:14,444
Can I warn you about one thing?

93
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:20,656
I don't know what kind of mission
you were dispatched here for.

94
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,328
To the country,
you're just another pawn.

95
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:29,735
If you like, you can always
go into business with me.

96
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:32,533
I am always ready to die.

97
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:39,939
I see.
I thought you might say that.

98
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:44,947
Then at least enjoy your life
here in the city, while you can.

99
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:49,111
Welcome...!

100
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:56,227
C-can I help you?

101
00:08:56,963 --> 00:08:59,625
W... here... is... B... ianca...?

102
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,499
I'm sorry, but Bianca has
already been sold...

103
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:06,696
B... ianca...
Where is she?

104
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:12,368
Bianca isn't here!
Please leave!

105
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:28,589
So she isn't here.

106
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:36,495
H-help! I...

107
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:48,509
Well, I'll see you.

108
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:51,248
Yeah.
Thanks for everything.

109
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:57,486
Oh, it's brother!

110
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:05,856
Definitely a good buy. He might not have
been lying about the noble part.

111
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,770
Hey, brother, where were you?
I was waiting for you! I was lonely.

112
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:17,202
This girl is still mistaking
me for her brother.

113
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:24,046
It's convenient for you.
Well, I'm done here, so I'll be leaving now.

114
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:26,251
Okay, thanks for everything.

115
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,449
Don't worry about it.
Well, enjoy the city life, okay?

116
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,616
Thank you.

117
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:37,356
Brother!

118
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:39,921
Come on, let's go inside.

119
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:43,529
W-what was that?!

120
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:49,906
It sounds foolish, but at the time,
I thought that her innocent smile...

121
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:54,173
had breathed new
life into the flowers.

122
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,962
W-what is this!?

123
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,906
Brother!
Brother, where are you?

124
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:46,493
Brother.

125
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:55,402
Here, money is all that matters,
and you can do whatever you want.

126
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:03,309
Brother!

127
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:09,585
What's the matter, brother?
What is this place? I'm scared.

128
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:15,521
It's okay. Nothing to worry
about, Bianca. Let's go back up.

129
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:19,994
Okay. I like the sun.
I hate the dark.

130
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:29,734
After that, every day
was like a dream.

131
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:37,979
Bianca thought I was her brother,
and I acted the part.

132
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:56,735
What was the point of this act?
It was a definite reality that...

133
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:01,934
her existence was causing me
to forget about my mission.

134
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,177
Hey, brother?

135
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:10,543
What is it?

136
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:13,877
You won't leave me and
go off again, will you?

137
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,915
Huh? Oh, of course I'm
not going anywhere.

138
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm so glad!

139
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:30,066
Thank you.

140
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:33,429
By the way,
where's Bianca?

141
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:38,175
Don't worry. I'm sure she's fast
asleep in the guest room.

142
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:41,112
Serena, go check on her.

143
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,008
That was the guest room!

144
00:13:46,218 --> 00:13:47,014
Bianca!

145
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:52,212
Brother!

146
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:54,925
Get away from Bianca!

147
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:01,797
Dammit!

148
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:14,676
B... ianca...

149
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,307
Stop!
Don't you touch Bianca!

150
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:23,952
B... ianca...
Bianca...

151
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:35,728
What the hell was that?

152
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,536
Do you know the Romanian
legend about monsters?

153
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:47,043
Monsters!?

154
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,276
Yeah. After I left your house,
I wanted to know more about her,

155
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:53,949
so I went to ask Bytone about it.

156
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,285
Did you find out anything?

157
00:14:57,356 --> 00:15:01,725
About a year ago, there was a revolt
in a part of Romania.

158
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:05,929
The national army went out
to quell the revolt...

159
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:08,122
but all that remained was
a mountain of dead bodies.

160
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:12,267
Burned corpses were hung
against the castle walls.

161
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,368
But something was
even stranger.

162
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:22,011
It was impossible, but the bodies
were all dried up...

163
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:26,044
As if they were stuck
in a fire that didn't burn.

164
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,955
And, among the corpses,
Bianca was the only one still standing.

165
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,591
B-but how is that?

166
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:48,899
The Romanian legend remains.
A family hated for cannibalism.

167
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:52,602
There was a rumor that the
monster lived in the castle.

168
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,544
The townspeople revolted
because they believed it.

169
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,079
F-Falco, what are you saying?

170
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:04,888
In the castle,
there were two children.

171
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:10,293
They were fraternal twins,
both with amazing silver hair.

172
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:14,199
What if she's one
of the two twins?

173
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,690
Just stop it! It's ridiculous!

174
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:21,966
I didn't believe it either,
until I saw that monster.

175
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:27,337
I'm thinking of your interests.
Return her to Bytone.

176
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:31,984
Brother...

177
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:34,885
Never! I'm not giving
Bianca to anyone!

178
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:40,893
N-No!! Brother!
I hate the dark!

179
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:45,064
- No! Stop!
- You saw that monster too!
You'll be safe hiding here!

180
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:47,157
- No! I don't want to!
I hate the dark!
- I'm doing this for you!

181
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:53,572
I didn't want to let her go.
The minute I thought that,

182
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,541
she had a simple
control over me.

183
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,009
A heightened sense of danger,
and anger, for no reason.

184
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:02,605
These feelings mixed together
and ignited my lust.

185
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:07,343
And the rest was
like tumbling downhill.

186
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,053
No! Stop!!
Brother! Brother!!

187
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,788
Now you can't run away, right?

188
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:21,124
- Brother, stop! Stop!
- This is to protect you!

189
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,595
Shut up! Here!

190
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:36,138
Don't. Brother, stop!
I'm scared!

191
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:39,147
Now, open your mouth!

192
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,155
Don't use your teeth!

193
00:17:57,936 --> 00:17:58,868
It's bitter!

194
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:14,752
No!

195
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,083
B-Bianca! Bianca!

196
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:24,996
Stop!!

197
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:44,049
Please stop...
I don't like it... Brother...

198
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:45,175
Keep quiet.

199
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:51,011
Don't leak!

200
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:05,666
P-please stop!

201
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,943
What had I become?
Her every scream was intoxicating.

202
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:25,223
It was turning me
into a simple beast.

203
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:41,334
No! I don't want to hurt anymore!

204
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:44,834
I'm sorry.
I won't hurt you anymore.

205
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:01,056
It feels weird.

206
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:17,739
Casius! Cas! Out at a time like this?
What happened?

207
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:25,083
Casius...

208
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:37,693
B-brother...

209
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,829
Brother...
Brother, you feel so good.

210
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:21,506
Bianca!

211
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:31,744
Brother! Brother! Brother!!

212
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,884
Bianca... Bianca...

213
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:21,194
B... ian... ca...

214
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:33,303
B... ianca...
Have you... forgotten me...?

215
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:52,126
W-why you little humans...

216
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:58,267
Silver weapons. Bastards.

217
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:01,569
Brother! Brother!!

218
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:03,831
Don't come, Bianca!!

219
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,013
NO!!

220
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:17,247
B-brother!? You're alive?

221
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:19,087
What did you say?!

222
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:25,788
Bianca, together we
can take over everything.

223
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:31,226
Eventually,
our kind will rule this world.

224
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:34,431
I don't care about the world.

225
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:36,831
Just come here!

226
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:38,943
- I won't let you!
- Don't!

227
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,113
Bianca!

228
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:56,356
How do you like the taste of a
silver bullet, monster? Casius!

229
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,088
You freak!

230
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:02,561
Stop! Please stop!

231
00:24:03,635 --> 00:24:08,231
So you're one of his friends?!
This is revenge! Move away!

232
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:13,442
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

233
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:25,584
Bianca, come with me!

234
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:30,919
Bianca.

235
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,529
I was afraid of this cursed body
that could only cause death.

236
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:41,800
To live forever into the future
in perpetual darkness.

237
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,277
Bianca!

238
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:51,575
I will go with my brother.
The cursed bloodline dies here.

239
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:54,877
- W-wait! I'm going with you!
- Stop it, Casius!

240
00:24:56,354 --> 00:24:59,448
Goodbye,
my foreign brother.

241
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:06,653
Bianca! Bianca! Bianca!!

242
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:15,166
It was at that
moment I realized...

243
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:19,275
I had lost Bianca forever.

244
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:25,742
All that remained before me
was pitch black darkness.

245
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:33,289
I would never go back there,
or so I thought.

246
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:43,929
But I stepped beyond the
rusted gate once more...

247
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:48,738
Only, two weeks later...
