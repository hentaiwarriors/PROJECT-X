1
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,620
What are you so down about?

2
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,650
Well...

3
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,620
lf you're gonna be like this,
what the hell are you gonna do?

4
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,590
Have some attitude.

5
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,360
You hold the key that will
change the world.

6
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,530
But...

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,500
l think l drank too much.

8
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,300
Right. This is it. Right here.

9
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,700
Get us a drink, boss!

10
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,330
Comin' up!

11
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,340
What's with this guy?
Looks fuckin' depressing.

12
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,770
What a dumpy old man.

13
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,850
l stuck these fingers up you.
Have a taste.

14
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,850
Hey, how about you spread it open
with your own fingers...

15
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,160
...nice and deep.

16
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,630
l knew a woman like you once,
a while back.

17
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,370
A masochist who loved
to be teased.

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,140
Not true...

19
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,200
Then, how do you like it there?

20
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,310
Yeah, just as l thought...

21
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,620
You'll take all the fingers
l can give you. Nice and wet.

22
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,890
You want it? Huh?

23
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,330
You want me to stick it in you?

24
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,730
Yes...

25
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,430
Say ''Please''. Say,
''Please give me your cock.''

26
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,610
Please stick your cock in me...

27
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,440
You're a real nympho, aren't you?

28
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,770
Feeling yourself up and
moving your hips around.

29
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,440
Well, l guess
l'll just have to do this hole too.

30
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,320
l moved your daughter to
another place.

31
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,800
Looks like you were just a bit too late.

32
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,170
Are you dead yet?

33
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,450
Cut! All right, well done!

34
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,620
Good work.
That's it for you, Koji.

35
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,690
Pretty impressive there.

36
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,560
We've got the takes
everyone else said were impossible.

37
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,530
Pretty dependable guy, this one.

38
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,430
He's the one who's pushing to do
these dangerous stunts.

39
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,800
lt's a fine line between a
daredevil and a fool.

40
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,250
We found a
brutally murdered male body!

41
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,820
All units report to the scene at once!

42
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,260
That's pretty bad, l tell ya.

43
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,630
Chopper unit is on its way.

44
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,860
You think it's the same as the
Bay Bridge incident?

45
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,170
There better not be another one
doing stuff like this.

46
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,480
Wow!
lt feels great being near the sea!

47
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,040
You can smell the salty air.

48
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,950
We're not here on vacation,
you know.

49
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,220
Lighten up a bit. Don't be so uptight.

50
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,890
Right, Miko?

51
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,510
What are you doing?!

52
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,510
There's nothing like a woman's crotch!

53
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,780
Good morning, Detective.

54
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,820
l'm only letting you on site because
of direct orders from the Chief.

55
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,950
l understand that. And l don't
find this one too interesting.

56
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,460
Let's just say
it's part of our dirty business.

57
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,770
Yes. ln regard to that,
we can clear it up by tomorrow.

58
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,240
Doctor, please rest assured that
l'll take care of this.

59
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,210
The damn politician's dumping
all over me on this.

60
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,280
Come in.

61
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,290
Chief, l've dispatched them to
the Bay Area crime site.

62
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,020
l see. Good work.

63
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,060
So that means
he's the only one not here?

64
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,190
You guys looking for me?

65
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,280
Good morning, Mr. Yamada.

66
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,870
l hope you're not behind this.

67
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,650
l don't have the kind of
artistic sense you see there.

68
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,580
Then, are you telling me there's at
least another responsible for this?

69
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,220
lt looks like this is a job where
you might have to risk your life.

70
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,560
l can only wish.

71
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,160
All right, we're bringing down the body.

72
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,570
Get in touch with the chopper.

73
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,770
No!

74
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,990
Hold it! That body falls
under our jurisdiction.

75
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,860
Don't you touch it!

76
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,430
What the...?! You guys?!

77
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,230
Come on, Detective.
lt's just for a short while.

78
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,600
Why are you so stiff, huh?

79
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,640
Wh-What are you doing?

80
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,810
Well then, Ms. Takamizawa.
lt's in your hands.

81
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,230
Hey!

82
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,140
lt's done, old man!

83
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,010
Let's just see how good
they are at solving this.

84
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,650
Shh! You're too loud.
What if someone hears you?

85
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,490
You sure can be small-minded.

86
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,010
l can't do it. l can't do
something so horrendous.

87
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,430
What are you talking about?

88
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,860
lt's too late for
second thoughts now.

89
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,560
No! l don't want to!

90
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,440
Don't be so shocked.
You did that.

91
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,810
l did...?!

92
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,690
l don't know about that.

93
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,480
Well, it's not like l don't like you.
l think you're very intriguing.

94
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,190
You don't have to worry.

95
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,290
l know very well that...

96
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,160
...everyone calls me ''zombie
woman'' behind my back.

97
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,020
Well, uh...

98
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,600
Who'd want to sleep with a
woman that looks like a corpse?

99
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,630
This is work. lf we know what
happened in his last moments...

100
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,200
...it might give us a clue to
solving this crime.

101
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,110
But, you know, no matter what
anyone does to me, l won't come.

102
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,620
Won't come?

103
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,480
Or rather, l'm not able to come,
so don't feel too bad.

104
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,960
l understand.

105
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,720
Go on in.

106
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,680
Koji!

107
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,380
Wh-What the hell is this
smell of blood?!

108
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,490
No! You mustn't transform now!

109
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,360
Wh-What's the deal with
this house, anyway?!

110
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,990
Well...

111
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,440
l-l'm sorry...!

112
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,140
l can't stand it any longer!

113
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,480
All right. Let's begin then.

114
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,100
Hey, take a look.

115
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,470
Oh, yes...!
lt feels so different this time!

116
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,780
Why's that?!

117
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,580
That's the first time l came.

118
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,170
That's what it feels like
to be alive.

119
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,120
Take these and you'll get a
taste of something so amazing...

120
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,890
...you've never had in your life.

121
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,370
What do you think?

122
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,370
Don't know...

123
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,140
Hey, how long does it
take this drug to hit me?

124
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,310
Where the hell did he go?

125
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,220
Never mind that.

126
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,380
We didn't pay for it.
lf it doesn't work, big deal.

127
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,770
More! More! More!

128
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,420
Are you going to kill me too?!
Koji! Please, no!

129
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,940
K.Y.? What the hell is this?

130
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,750
Koji.

131
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,320
What is it?

132
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,390
You forgot this.

133
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,490
Oh, damn, l left it. Thanks.

134
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,000
Wearing the ring of some old flame?

135
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,440
That's none of your business!

136
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,940
That person... lt's like
she's calling out for help.

137
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,450
She's suffering,
in very difficult circumstances.

138
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,650
Are you saying Yuki's alive?!

139
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:46,550
Well, it's the first time l felt
something when touching an object.

140
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,650
l'm not sure myself
what to make of it.

141
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,260
Touch it again!

142
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,460
We're supposed to have a
professional relationship.

143
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,000
lt's not right to mix
our personal lives in with it.

144
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,340
Just once more!
Please check it out again!

145
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,340
Don't you listen!

146
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,610
You really are a zombie!

147
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,610
You don't know anything about
the human soul!

148
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,840
That's right.
l am a corpse after all!

149
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,390
Stop it!

150
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,550
Well? Can you see any visions?

151
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,560
l see nothing now.

152
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,260
Honey, are you going to be
able to take next Saturday off?

153
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,990
Sure, no problem. We can all
go out together as planned.

154
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,000
Where are we going?

155
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,090
Where would we like to go?

156
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,370
l'd like to go to the seashore!

157
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,030
l wanna go to the amusement park!
You too, right, big sis?

158
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,340
Yeah!

159
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,070
All right! We're going to the
amusement park then!

160
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,120
Darn. So, l'm going to be
surrounded by brats all day, huh?

161
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,130
The victim wasn't aware at all
that he was in danger.

162
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,330
The assailant approached
from above...

163
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,000
...where the victim wasn't looking.

164
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,870
Either he has some superhuman power...

165
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,600
...or perhaps he's able to fly.

166
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:22,310
The victim was taken by an enormous
force that he couldn't resist.

167
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,620
He was only able to flail his limbs
about in futility.

168
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,150
The assailant is...

169
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,710
...a bird? An animal?

170
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,850
No, he appears to be somewhat human...

171
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,890
...but the victim was dead before
he had a chance to see his assailant.

172
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,300
What he saw after that was...

173
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,970
...an image of his own body
as he faced his death.

174
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,910
As he was played with like a toy...

175
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,850
...l wonder how he felt.

176
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,820
...can you believe that?

177
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,860
Oh, look. There he is.

178
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,830
He's not even a student but always
wondering around doing nothing!

179
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,530
There're a lot of
men like that these days.

180
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,540
l hope he doesn't commit
some weird crime.

181
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,770
You have to keep an
eye on men like that.

182
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,330
l wish they'd be more subtle
with their gossiping.

183
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,080
Hey, it's Yuta. Wow, what an
amazing gun you've got!

184
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,850
Grandpa bought it for me.

185
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,480
Yeah? You sure have a
good Grandpa.

186
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,790
Yeah. But you know...

187
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,360
...he always brings home
the same toy.

188
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,270
Hey! lt's Mom!

189
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,380
l'm back, Yuta.

190
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,010
Oh, Mr. Yamada.
On your way home from work?

191
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,450
Yes.

192
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,890
Let's go home, Yuta.

193
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,860
No way!
l wanna hang out with Koji!

194
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,630
Come on, Yuta. Don't be
difficult on your mother.

195
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,620
That's quite some underwear
she's got on.

196
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,550
Die, you evil demon!

197
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,850
Aghh! You got me!

198
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,750
Come on, Yuta, he's a busy man.

199
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,100
l'm sorry, Mr. Yamada.

200
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,300
lt's all right.

201
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,300
Yuta...

202
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,200
When l have a day off,
we can spend more time together.

203
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,000
Yeah!

204
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,770
Good day, then.

205
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,380
Good day.

206
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,820
Koji!

207
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,020
Bye!

208
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,250
Huh?

209
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,760
The key's gone.

210
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,930
l'm sure l locked the door though.

211
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:25,960
Wha...?

212
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,470
What is this?
Sneaking into my place like that?

213
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,700
Lighten up. A pretty woman is
here to see you, after all.

214
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,970
lt would be nice if you showed
a little more enthusiasm.

215
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,940
l don't have much interest in
skanky bitches like you.

216
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,180
Oh? Now l know why you were
getting excited by some housewife.

217
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,390
l saw it, right through the window.

218
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,860
Apparently her husband's been
missing for six months.

219
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,200
How do you know all that?

220
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,100
lf you listen to the ladies talk...

221
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,430
...you can find out about
everything in the neighborhood.

222
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,000
Koji...

223
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,790
You think you have a chance,
don't you?

224
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,310
Well, she's not at all the kind of
person you think she is.

225
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,670
Really...

226
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,770
Let me give you one piece of advice.

227
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,910
You know, the ''natural'' types...

228
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,580
...they're the ones you
have to be most careful about.

229
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,520
When you strip her from that shell,
you could be in for a shock.

230
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,590
Shut up!

231
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,190
How scary.

232
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,130
What are you doing
in my apartment anyway?

233
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,860
l got into a fight with my boyfriend.

234
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,500
So, can l spend just one night here?

235
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:43,730
lf you let me stay, then
l'll let you have me just once.

236
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,040
Who'd wanna do it with you.

237
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,700
Oh, really.

238
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,990
Don't tease me. Hurry!

239
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,120
You just wait.

240
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,060
Hurry up!

241
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,920
Get on your knees, bitch!

242
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,170
Upsy-daisy...

243
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,600
What are you doing?

244
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,340
You mean this?

245
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,250
l don't sleep very well unless l do
a handstand before l go to bed.

246
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,180
That's pretty different.

247
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:06,920
Oh, no...!

248
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,680
The walls are thin in this place,
so keep quiet.

249
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,790
My chest hurts...!

250
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,530
After this...

251
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,870
...tomorrow will be all lovey dovey.

252
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,080
This is boring.

253
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,780
Strong will power.

254
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,270
Wh-What is it, Koji?

255
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,700
Don't you have your period?

256
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,310
Why do you ask?

257
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,510
l should be getting it any day now.

258
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,880
l smell blood.

259
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,650
What? Then that's a problem.
l don't have any tampons.

260
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,480
Oh, what a drag. l just got it now.

261
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,400
What?

262
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,340
What's the matter, Koji?

263
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,900
What's wrong?

264
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,440
Stay away!

265
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,370
What?!

266
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,250
l know you wanna do it, there's
no need to get all freaked out.

267
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,310
l told you that at the beginning.

268
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,440
lt's not like that.

269
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,780
Who'd do it with you anyway?

270
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,760
What is this stench of blood?!

271
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,130
lt's as if there's blood
splattering all over me!

272
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,340
What's the matter?

273
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,130
Stay away!

274
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,560
The multiple murders must be his doing!

275
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,030
What should we do?!

276
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:38,160
Get in touch with everyone!
l'll try to hold him here!

277
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,500
Uh, all right.

278
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,080
This is an emergency!
Everyone, please hurry!

279
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,990
A monster possibly the multiple
murderer sighted near Koji's!

280
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,190
He's going after the monster!

281
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,120
Everyone, head over to the site!

282
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,670
lt's finally started.

283
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,350
lsn't this just
what we were hoping for?

284
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,250
But one or the other will die.

285
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,810
That can't be helped.

286
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:41,590
Otherwise there's no way of
knowing who's stronger.

287
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,230
Come right over here.

288
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,500
l'll set up a great stage
just for you guys.

289
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,100
Wha...?! What is this?!

290
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,110
Let's... Let's go home.

291
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,040
No! You just watch carefully!

292
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,420
lt's strong...!
