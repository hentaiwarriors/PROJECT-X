00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,666
<i>One: A Glorious Season, Episode 3</i>

2
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,326
Kohei!

3
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,893
You sleepyhead! Wake up now!

4
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,942
What the...

5
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,445
Kohei, where are you?

6
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,447
Your bag and uniform are
here, so you must be here.

7
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,281
You'll be late for class for sure!

8
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,752
Where are you?

9
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,661
I got you!

10
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,522
Come out!

11
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,934
Good morning...

12
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:20,138
Why are you sleeping under the bed?

13
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,535
I thought that you'd be surprised, so...

14
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,339
My goodness, I was surprised!

15
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,605
Are you happy now?

16
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,272
I guess.

17
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,947
Why didn't you prepare
for school last night?

18
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:39,782
You have to learn to do this everyday!

19
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:44,227
We have Math class, Japanese
Literature and gym class!

20
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:49,762
Kohei...

21
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:50,563
What?

22
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,829
Are you sure that you were lying
under the bed just to surprise me?

23
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,936
Can you think of any other reason?

24
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:04,015
You surprise me all the time,
you didn't need to do that.

25
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,417
You couldn't be comfortable
sleeping like that.

26
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,813
You know I'm the type of
person who can sleep anywhere.

27
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:15,553
There are other things you can
do to surprise me, you know.

28
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,055
For instance?

29
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,627
Well, you know...

30
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:24,436
Like, you could appreciate me
for waking you up every morning.

31
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,673
Okay, then how about
going out on a date?

32
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,004
What?

33
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,669
It's perfect since today is Saturday.

34
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,173
I don't think that's
such a great idea...

35
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,338
Why?

36
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,244
Well, you know...

37
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:43,055
Some girls might get upset
if they saw us together...

38
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,989
Nah, I don't think so.

39
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,649
There're girls who like you, you know?

40
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:48,522
No way.

41
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,560
Yes.

42
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,355
Who?

43
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,822
I don't know who those girls are.

44
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,430
Okay then, let's go out on a date.

45
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,063
Kohei?

46
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,381
Were you sleeping under the bed,
so we'd have this conversation?

47
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,188
W-Well, that's quite
a stretch, isn't it?

48
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,420
Kohei, I know you are lying
because you looked away from me.

49
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,661
Let's go! We're gonna be late!

50
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,501
Oh wait!

51
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,194
My home is this way.

52
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:29,727
Okay.

53
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,252
Good night.

54
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,634
What's wrong?

55
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:41,402
It's just that you were
really nice to me today...

56
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,737
You're not going to go
way or anything, are you?

57
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,780
What are you talking about?

58
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,109
Just a thought.

59
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,752
Well, good night...

60
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,882
Sometimes I just want to cry...

61
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,997
Where should I go to cry?
What I should cry for?

62
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:11,032
A feeling of emptiness never
brings happiness to us...

63
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,930
Floating in the ocean,
what should I cry for?

64
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:21,112
Happiness? Why would
I want such a thing?

65
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:27,511
I feel as if I have a hole in my heart,
and there is nothing left to lose.

66
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,145
Can I call it a perfect environment?

67
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:34,984
If I have nothing to lose in this
world, what am I still afraid of?

68
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,696
It is like the dead
end I am heading for.

69
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,528
It is like the end of a story...

70
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:51,034
I felt the same emptiness
before I knew all of this.

71
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,439
Emptiness...

72
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,538
Emptiness...

73
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:11,029
I couldn't do anything, but wait.

74
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:23,368
After he left, I started
to forget about him.

75
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:24,897
Misaki...

76
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,473
Who are you?

77
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,569
Have we met?

78
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,790
Hello, young man!

79
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,261
She made me feel so uncomfortable...

80
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,397
Are you looking for a
gift for your girlfriend?

81
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,793
Yeah...

82
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,436
What are you looking for?

83
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,636
If I'd known, I would have gotten it!

84
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:02,137
Excuse me?

85
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:06,067
Oh, I want something that
can make a girl smile...

86
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,737
Well, how about these stuffed dolls?

87
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,950
They are popular items in this store.

88
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:19,047
These are so popular that
sometimes we sell them out in a day!

89
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,260
Um, could I have this one?

90
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:32,561
Hello?

91
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,967
Mizuka? It's me.

92
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,073
Hey, what's up?

93
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,302
Do you wanna go out with me next
Sunday?

94
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,537
What?

95
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,204
What's wrong?

96
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,108
We just had a date last week!

97
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,377
Is anything wrong with having
dates two weeks in a row?

98
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,489
I'm not saying it's wrong...

99
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:55,889
Okay, then I'll meet you
at 3:00 pm at the park then.

100
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,963
Okay, I'm looking forward to it!

101
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,900
I have to make up to her
for the Christmas party!

102
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,469
I can't believe that I overslept today!

103
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,590
Good, she isn't here yet...

104
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:33,865
Well, who does she think
she is... keeping me waiting?

105
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,506
What is she doing?

106
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,211
Is she still picking up her clothing?

107
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,918
I can't believe this! The forecast
said precipitation percentage is 20%!

108
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,387
Does that mean that it
rains 20 percent of a day?

109
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,464
It's not funny...

110
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:14,498
But Mizuka would wait for
me, she's that kind of girl...

111
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,149
What is she doing?

112
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,026
Are you all right, Kohei?

113
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,291
Mizuka...

114
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:54,110
Your aunt told me that you didn't
come back after you went to the park.

115
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,543
I was so surprised when I
found you lying on the ground!

116
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,345
What were you doing there?

117
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,549
Don't you remember our promise?

118
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,282
What?

119
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,092
Nothing...

120
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,758
Mizuka?

121
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,231
You are pretty...

122
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,462
What are you saying all of sudden?

123
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,256
No, Kohei...

124
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,197
Your kiss tastes like milk.

125
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,131
I remember you like milk...

126
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,661
Stupid...

127
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,546
Kohei, you'd better stay in bed!

128
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,379
No!

129
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,127
What are you doing, Kohei?

130
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,056
You smell good, Mizuka...

131
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,557
Kohei...

132
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,769
No, we'd better stop...

133
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:31,874
I mean, we can do this another
day, after you're all better...

134
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,446
No! Don't look!

135
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,537
I want to see!

136
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,774
Kohei?

137
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,646
I want to see it closer.

138
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,812
Kohei, you're too close...

139
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,290
You must be kidding...

140
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,486
Mizuka, let me put it in.

141
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,786
You look exhausted, Kohei...

142
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,691
I can do this because I like you...

143
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,024
Kohei...

144
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:33,805
Did I hurt you?

145
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:34,997
No...

146
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,267
Here we go...

147
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,907
You're going to break me!

148
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,645
It feels amazing!

149
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,977
Kohei! It feels great!

150
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,082
Kohei!

151
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,456
I can't hold it any longer!

152
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,197
I feel so hot inside!

153
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,394
Come, Kohei! Come inside of me!

154
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,155
Aw, it's so cute!

155
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,962
I wish I could've
seen Kohei buying this!

156
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,432
You are mean!

157
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,766
Thank you very much, Kohei.

158
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:12,869
I'll cherish this.

159
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:13,829
All right.

160
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,974
I'll stop by tomorrow.

161
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:17,838
Okay.

162
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,657
It's the way to home...

163
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,627
Hmm?

164
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,699
I feel like I'm on my way home.

165
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,926
Is that so?

166
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,727
I went somewhere far away that day.

167
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,430
Yeah?

168
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:53,273
That day, the sky looked so
much different from usual...

169
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:58,716
It seemed as if the sky led me to
a different direction in my life...

170
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:04,685
But I couldn't go home because
I went too far that day.

171
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,824
I ended up crossing the ocean and
living in a city I didn't know.

172
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:15,732
After I grew up, I remembered there
was a city where I spent my childhood.

173
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,761
It was such a lonesome feeling...

174
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,906
Because the real affection and
warmth should have been there.

175
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,639
Maybe you are talking
about yourself now...

176
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,371
Did I sound like that?

177
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,309
Yes...

178
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,110
I tried my best until the very end.

179
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:36,948
I wished to stay in my old town forever.

180
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,018
I didn't mean to deny this world...

181
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,860
Rather, I thought if
I accepted this world...

182
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,757
...I would be allowed
to stay in my old place.

183
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,767
But it didn't work.

184
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,929
I don't want you to tell
me a story like that.

185
00:17:54,106 --> 00:18:02,070
I wonder if I would have worked harder,
could I have stayed where I was?

186
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,144
Why?

187
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:09,676
I'm not saying that I
don't want to come here...

188
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:15,224
I just regret that the bonds
I had with other people...

189
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,728
...were not worthy enough
to tie me to that world.

190
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:19,855
What do you think?

191
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,626
I don't think you could...

192
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:26,535
Because this world
starts inside of you...

193
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,036
I see...

194
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,072
Yes...

195
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:34,075
Or maybe I could put an
end to this world being...

196
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,274
Yeah, maybe I still can...

197
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:42,443
This world would not end,
because it's already over...

198
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,969
Hey, Kohei!

199
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,107
Good morning.

200
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,675
Good morning...

201
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,370
What are you doing?

202
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,674
I've been waiting for you, of course.

203
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,615
Waiting for me?

204
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,914
Yes, waiting for you.

205
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,248
This is your first time, isn't it?

206
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,187
I guess so.

207
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,316
Does this bother you?

208
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,792
Not at all.

209
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,260
I like it!

210
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,126
Okay, good.

211
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,960
Yes, I am happy.

212
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,728
You don't have to repeat yourself!

213
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,364
Embarrassed?

214
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,300
No way!

215
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,071
Are you sure?

216
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,604
Well, let's go!

217
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,333
Yes!

218
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,744
Kohei, where were you yesterday?

219
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,547
What?

220
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:55,716
Your aunt told me that you didn't
come home after you went to the park.

221
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:03,197
Well, I was at a coffee
shop, then I fell asleep.

222
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,862
Unbelievable!

223
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:27,814
Eternity...

224
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,191
There is a place that exists
forever beyond this world.

225
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:37,535
The new world was born on that day,
passed, and now is about to disappear.

226
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,461
And now I'm heading for that world...

227
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,910
Oh, Mizuka...

228
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,289
I guess we are strangers now, huh?

229
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,570
Good bye, my lover for life...

230
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,214
I got you!

231
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,148
I finally got you!

232
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,886
I was pretending to be a stranger
because I thought you'd disappear...

233
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:16,531
I wanted to run to you and hold
you tight, but I held myself back...

234
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,994
I was about to burst into
tears but I tried not to.

235
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,101
It hurts...

236
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,675
You are holding me too tight, Mizuka...

237
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:26,835
I'm not letting you go!

238
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,844
You'll leave me alone and disappear.

239
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,042
I am not going anywhere.

240
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,118
Really?

241
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,813
Really.

242
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:37,853
I just...

243
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,691
I just want to hold you.

244
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,479
We were around their age...

245
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,923
I met Kohei...

246
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,454
In front of that swing...

247
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,202
Why are you crying?

248
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,141
Because I'm lonely...

249
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,573
What made you so sad?

250
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,851
I thought that my happy
days would never end...

251
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,356
But I learned that nothing
would last forever...

252
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,551
There is eternity...

253
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,855
Eternity is here...

254
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,256
I'll be with you forever.

255
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:06,637
That girl was you, Mizuka...

256
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,112
What happened, Mizuka?

257
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:19,985
Am I smiling now?

258
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,890
Yeah, you are smiling...

259
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:25,963
Are you sure?

260
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:26,962
Yes.

261
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,531
I'll choke you if you lie.

262
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,430
Are you trying to kill me?

263
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,949
I've been living a normal life.

264
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,494
I've been trying to lead
my life like I used to.

265
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:11,233
It was not easy for me, but I was always
trying to have a positive attitude.

266
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:16,712
But what made me feel sad like this?

267
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:23,380
The season changes so
slowly, but it's for sure.

268
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,850
I can't stay in the same season.

269
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,589
Time still passes.

270
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,685
Little by little, I'm getting
further away from that day.

271
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:35,927
What I was looking for and what
I am looking for are not the same.

272
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,025
The view is also different.

273
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,030
Everything changes.

274
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,664
The only things that can
stay the same are memories.

275
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,571
The brightest memories...

276
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:49,139
Things wouldn't change in this world.

277
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:53,980
Even a boy disappears from this
world, and from everyone's memory...

278
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:58,186
But he would never
disappear from my memory.

279
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:02,659
Because I know Kohei
will be back someday.

280
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,228
Hey Mizuka, I'm Mr. Rabbit!
You look a little down!

281
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,527
Whose fault is that?

282
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,637
Listen Mizuka.

283
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:17,205
Do you have a stupid
and senseless friend?

284
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,602
Well, he actually likes you a lot.

285
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,106
Why are you telling me that now?

286
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:28,618
So please smile for him.

287
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,888
Because your smile makes him happy.

288
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,259
You should talk!

289
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,387
And even though he's not around,
please don't forget to smile, Mizuka.

290
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,067
Even if it's hard for you,
smile as much as possible

291
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,531
You never know when he'll come back.

292
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:54,444
Well, that's all now. I hope
I cheered you up. Good-bye!

293
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:01,250
So Kohei, please come back soon...

294
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:07,924
This is a lonely place,
and I'm standing here.

295
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,258
No...

296
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,819
I'm feeling sad because
I know something now...

297
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,093
Are you sad?

298
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,794
Yes. I didn't need any prize.

299
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,632
Even though it gives you pleasure?

300
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,502
I realized that I didn't need them.

301
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,573
Why?

302
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,601
It's about growing up.

303
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:28,701
I don't understand.

304
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,038
You don't know yet.

305
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,180
Because you are still a child.

306
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,778
Are you leaving?

307
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,716
Yes.

308
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,582
Do you know that you
can't come back, right?

309
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,621
Yes. I know.

310
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,089
So you chose this.

311
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,056
Yeah.

312
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,558
Kohei

313
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:44,595
I have to go now.

314
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,425
Okay. Good-bye.

315
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,930
Thank you. Bye.

316
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,040
Then he suddenly came upon me!

317
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,517
And then?

318
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,219
So I threw his ass so bad.

319
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,014
It's funny.

320
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,317
It's too soon, and I wasn't ready!

321
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:25,167
Hey man, I haven't
seen you in a long time!

322
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,499
What happened to you? Did you get
sick?

323
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,853
Hey, Mizuka...

324
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,229
Well...

325
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,132
I'm back.

326
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,269
Let's stay together
forever from now on...
