Where there is light there is shadow.

Those born in darkness die in darkness...

3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,140
...and there is no one to pick up the corpses.

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,950
The year is 199X, the end of the millennium.

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,190
The "ninja" are still assassins
and conspirators of the darkness...

6
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,320
...and live in a hidden village.

There must be a trick door somewhere.

I shall search more!

Sagiri!

25
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:03,273
I knew you were not concentrating
on your recent training.

26
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:07,343
I also knew you were following me around...

27
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:10,044
...waiting for an opportunity.

28
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,287
What do you have in your clothes?
Is that a secret scroll...

29
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,726
...handed down from generation to
generation in this ninja village?

30
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,728
Or is it our secret treasure,
"Super Constipation Relief?"

31
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,672
If you want it, you may have it.

32
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:30,605
If you can get out of this village alive!

33
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:57,958
Follow her!

34
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:04,540
Listen, everybody.

35
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,842
While training here, you may not
have evil thoughts or delusions.

36
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:11,712
Our ancestors have bestowed
upon us hidden techniques...

37
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,809
...secret tricks, curses...

38
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,947
...even physical techniques, but
our presence as assassins of shadows...

39
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,653
...is only attainable if each
one of us strives day and night...

40
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:24,355
...never tiring in exerting ourselves.

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,560
To kill a person, you not only
need the appropriate technique...

42
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:31,694
...you will also need to learn to
shut out doubt, pity, even anger...

43
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,332
...and reach the state of absolute enlightenment.

44
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:40,168
If you cannot free yourself
from your own earthly desires...

45
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,771
...you are not qualified to stay here!

46
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,507
I won't stop you.

47
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,280

No.

57
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,609
I'm all warmed up.

58
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,579
Did you clean yourself well, Suzuka?

59
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,580
Of course!

60
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:22,087
I'm a little lady, squeaky clean
all over, and smelling of soap.

61
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:27,256
Tomorrow is Sunday, so let's do
it slow and thorough tonight...

62
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,490
Come on, Tsukikage, you're
always slow and thorough.

63
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,128
This is the best.

64
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:40,234
It's so warm, and it feels so good.

65
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,241
I'll make you feel even better tonight.

66
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,903
Tsukikage, that's all you think about.

67
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:53,750
What's wrong?

68
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,150
Someone is over there. Shh!

69
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,024
Sagiri?

70
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,489
Hey, Suzuka.

71
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,298
Why are you here?

72
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,628
Here she is again.

73
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,770
I am an Escaped Ninja now too.

74
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,574

75
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,303
Sagiri! Sagiri!

76
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,499
Sagiri, are you up?

77
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,666
You surprised us last night..

78
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,972
...showing up all of the sudden
with your clothes in tatters.

79
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,410
You were lucky you were not hurt too badly.

80
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,808
Please!

81
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,012
Has your man been injured or something?

82
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,756
You guys have to be careful.

83
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,185
No, nothing like that.

84
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:10,420
Okay, here's the usual. It's on the house today.

85
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,485
Take care.

86
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:15,031
She remembers us...

87
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,237
Something's not right.

88
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,105
Why did Sagiri escape?

89
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,212
She is so full of herself, so
insolent, haughty, and brash.

90
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:33,877
Not to mention extremely self-centered.

91
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,287
How could she do something
that could endanger her life?

92
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,054
You just don't know when to quit.

93
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:46,029
You had to escape just to come after Suzuka?

94
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,534
You might want to give up this futile pursuit.

95
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,307
That's not it.

96
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,511
No, Tsukikage. I...

97
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,044
I love you, Tsukikage.

98
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,960
I just can't forget you.

99
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,997
I just can't forget that night...

100
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,055
...when you taught me the joy of being a woman.

101
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,430
You idiot.

102
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,742
Since the moment you lit up
the sensual energy hidden in me...

103
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:42,480
...I have lost all reason.

104
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:46,514
My heart is flip-flopping.
My body is writhing with desire.

105
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,260
So, Tsukikage...

106
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,459
Come on.

107
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,844
Come on, Tsukikage.

108
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,876
You will be mine.

109
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,920
Mine, mine, mine.

110
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:24,390
Something is indeed wrong.

111
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,226
Okay! I'm going to interrogate her.

112
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:32,998
I'm home. I got some medicine...

113
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,972
No! What are you doing?

114
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,815
No! Don't touch Tsukikage!

115
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:46,112
Tsukikage, you too?!

116
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,846
Say something.

117
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,686
Tsukikage?

118
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,192
What did you do to Tsukikage, Sagiri?

119
00:09:56,261 --> 00:10:00,459
Guess. But soon Tsukikage will be mine.

120
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,597
Why do you have to keep on bothering us?

121
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,638
Oh no, it's Tsukikage's fault.

122
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:08,897
Step aside!

123
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:11,067
What are you talking about? No!

124
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,771
Hey! Stay away, Sagiri!

125
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,209
Step aside!

126
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,917
Ever since that night, my heart
has been stolen by Tsukikage.

127
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:28,853
So, in return, I decided to
steal Tsukikage from you.

128
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,895
What nonsense are you talking about?

129
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,591
Stay away from him.

130
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,429
Shut up!

131
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:42,039
Incredibly powerful.

132
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:43,597
I can do anything.

133
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,474
Love is blind. You can do anything for love.

134
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,537
And in love, the winner takes all!

135
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,811
You're wasting your time.

136
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:55,115
No! You must be kidding!

137
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,588
Look, he's so big for me!

138
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:00,716

139
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,954

145
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,037
How dare you use techniques for this!

146
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,014
Who said we can't?

147
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,352
By the way, Suzuka, I want you
to enjoy it a little as well.

148
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,190
What did you do to me?

149
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:39,696
You will soon find out.

150
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,795
Right, Tsukikage?

151
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,818
How about it, Suzuka? Do you feel it?

152
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,153
The same pleasure that
Tsukikage is enjoying right now?

153
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:18,127
You will experience it with
Tsukikage as I take his backbone out.

154
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,465
Enjoy!

155
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,405
No!

156
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,307
No, not like this.

157
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:51,800
My body is responding.

158
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:55,672
Are you not happy now, Suzuka?

159
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,404
Finally, you are literally one
with Tsukikage, body and soul.

160
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,774
It will just be a minute,
so why don't you enjoy it?

161
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,344
Can you feel it?

162
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,914
How much Tsukikage is enjoying
my tongue and fingers?

163
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:18,956
Once he experiences this, he will
never be able to be without me.

164
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,392
She's not even touching me...

165
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,901
...yet she's licking my nerve endings directly.

166
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,235
Is Tsukikage feeling the same sensation?

167
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:44,113
Sagiri, what's the point of doing this?

168
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:48,888
Do you want a puppet with the face of Tsukikage?

169
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,557
Say whatever you want while you can.

170
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:56,624
Soon you will be swallowed in
waves of pleasure and be quiet.

171
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:06,707
Can you hold off until
Tsukikage falls for me, Suzuka?

172
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:15,152
I know I'm forcing this.

173
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,020
But how else could I come
between the two of you?

174
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,854
This is the only way.

175
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:24,589
I may not have wanted it, but he is my first man.

176
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,359
How could I ever forget him?

177
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,704
No more. I'm going crazy.

178

00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,942
Suzuka is reaching her end.

180
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,280
Come on, Tsukikage. Come. Come a lot.

181
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,147
Come and be mine.

182
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:54,525
Come for me!

183
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,829
No, no, no, no!

184
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,811
You have to be kidding.

185
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,786
Tsukikage, why don't you come?

186
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,121
Tsukikage?

187
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:32,090
Enough already, Sagiri. You were awesome.

188
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,132
Tsukikage.

189
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,898
But I am no good unless it is with Suzuka.

190
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,869
Tsukikage.

191
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,837
How could you defeat that technique?

192
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:53,481
That was nothing compared to
the love between the two of us.

193
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,350
Tsukikage!

194
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:55,727
Corny...

195
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,484
Just kidding.

196
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:03,392
Romance begins when two hearts
are attracted to each other.

197
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,454
You just can't force your feelings.

198
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,167
It was quite close, though.

199
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,931
Yes, if you have to force your
feelings, you're still a child.

200
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,565
You can't use secret ninja techniques!

201
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,335
Say whatever you want!

202
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,003
Well, you have become
an Escaped Ninja, after all.

203
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,444
Why don't you take your time
to look at the world around you?

204
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,914
This is so discouraging.

205
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:32,423
I know a kind of job you might be good at...

206
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:37,053
...though it might be a bit hard
to find a man as cool as I am.

207
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:39,827
You're the coolest!

208
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:40,713
I am, aren't I?
You're the coolest!

209
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:41,765
I am, aren't I?
{\i1} {\i0}

210
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,767
Okay, okay, I get it.

211
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,900
I'm the fifth wheel. Okay.

212
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:55,137
What's the point of pursuing him? It's hopeless.

213
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,777
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

214
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:04,821
Sagiri...

215
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,225
Bye bye, Tsukikage.

216
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:52,998
Watch it.

217
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,130
Hey! You're getting slow, Suzuka.

218
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,941
That wasn't fair! You threw shuriken!

219
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:01,038
What are you mumbling about?

220
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,640
We have to do it for real, or you'll go soft.

221
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,684
You've been gaining weight, haven't you?

222
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,150
Ouch!

223
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,653
Just because you're an Escaped Ninja...

224
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,588
...doesn't mean you can spend
the days without working.

225
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,759
You are so not romantic.

226
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:22,662
I just wanted to spend time out here
enjoying the cherry blossoms with you.

227
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:28,529
Look. Petals lightly-colored,
floating against the night sky...

228
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,404
It's so romantic.

229
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,174
Speaking of romance...

230
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,718
Huh?

231
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,001
Tsukikage...

232
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:02,764
"Crimson flowers shower onto the soft bare skin."

233
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,105
This is a poem.

234
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,769
You...

235
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:09,475
Oh, Tsukikage. I'm cold.

236
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:13,917
Don't worry. I'll do this to you...

237
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:16,419
Oh, Tsukikage. I'm hot.

238
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,080
{\pos(90,250)}Karakuri\NNinja\NGirl

239
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,968
I'm cold and trembling.

240
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,901
What? A cold?

241
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,529
Do I have one?

242
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,384
Tsukikage!

243
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:53,750
Is this where you introduced Sagiri for work?

244
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,793
Yeah, I introduced her there.

245
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,761
How come you know of a place like this?

246
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,025
How come? Well...

247
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:05,401
I was studying the custom of the ordinary people.

248
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:10,738
Hey, Tsukikage! You said I was the only one!

249
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,437
Are you listening to me?

250
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:19,241
Tsukikage! What's wrong? Tsukikage!

251
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,788
Welcome!

252
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:33,158
Mr. Teacher, please be gentle with me.

253
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,893
Hello! What seems to be the problem today?

254
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:43,003
Okay, let's perform an operation.

255
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:49,637
Attention please, thank you
for boarding Fuck-Pack Airlines.

256
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:55,781
So Mister, do you want the
first class special service?

257
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,481
So many men are way more awesome than Tsukikage!

258
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,754
Bigger, better lovers!

259
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:05,796
Could this be...

260
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,256
Could this be...

261
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,260
{\pos(100,45)\frz26}heavenly

262
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,260

269
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:19,209
I haven't seen the two of them in a while.

270
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:21,877
I wonder how they are doing.

271
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,418
What? Colds? Both of you?

272
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,527
It's so nice out there and I came
all this way to play with you...

273
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:40,120
...but look at yourselves!

274
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,725
But we were up in the cherry tree.

275
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:46,701
It was so hot at night, so we
kicked off the blanket...

276
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:49,706
...and we were both naked so
we got colds in the morning.

277
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:52,208
The water was not hot
enough at the public bath...

278
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:56,270
You're so soft... How would I ever
know that you both used to be ninjas?

279
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:01,015
I know you two are passing the cold back and forth.

280
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:06,980
Tsukikage, your temperature is not coming down.

281
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,357
I'm done for.

282
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:12,726
Suzuka, you know something?

283
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:15,459
After a man has a fever for too many days...

284
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,728
...I heard his cock will no longer get hard.

285
00:22:17,802 --> 00:22:20,669
No, no way!

286
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,973
No, Tsukikage, you have to cool yourself!

287
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,772
What are you doing?

288
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,775
You have to cool yourself, too.

289
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,944
This won't work. I wanted to play with them...

290
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,386
...but I don't want to catch a cold myself.

291
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,791
See you later. Take care.

292
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,219
Hmm?

293
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:46,891
Oh yeah!

294
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,456
I have a good medicine.

295
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:54,698
It's a ninja medicine, so it is
the best! Do you know about these?

296
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,900
I don't remember them well.

297
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,273
I rarely got colds.

298
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,038
Okay, take care.

299
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,581
It's bitter!

300
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,327
What was that?

301
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,324
I'm getting warm.

302
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,530
Not warm...

303
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,862
I'm...

304
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,810
Maybe that medicine was...

305
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,347
She tricked us.

306
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,208
I'm hot!

307
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,449
Something is weird about me.

308
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,322
Me too.

309
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,925
My body! Help me!

310
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,267
What's going on? We haven't done anything yet!

311
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,867
Suzuka!

312
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,740
Tsukikage!

313
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,875
I can't.

314
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:15,944
Already?

315
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,920
No! Not yet.

316
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:19,583
Awesome!

317
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:21,750
It's hotter than usual.

318
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,695
So hot. So hot.

319
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:26,559
Suzuka.

320
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,565
Again?

321
00:24:38,943 --> 00:24:40,205
Again?

322
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,169
Again?

323
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,872
Again?

324
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,622
I think we have overcome our fever...

325
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:02,126
...but Tsukikage is not responding to me!

326
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:08,002
I think we just did it too many times.

327
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,604
"Dear Lady Youga, how are you?"

328
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,474
"What's new and exciting in the ninja village?"

329
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:18,038
"Tsukikage and I came out of
our fever and we are doing fine."

330
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:22,712
"Tsukikage works hard, and
I am a cute newlywed wife..."

331
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:26,450
"...but we never forget the
ninja techniques and pride."

332
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:31,621
"We train rigorously everyday,
and get along fine with Sagiri."

333
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:36,429
"We would like to visit you
and bring some souvenirs."

334
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,368
"Well, until then..."

335
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,829
"...goodbye. Suzuka."
