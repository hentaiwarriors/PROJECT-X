1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,720
When the ancient seal of
the Gods is opened...

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,890
the earth will once again
be covered by the fires of hell.

3
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,730
Evil spirits will dominate...

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,040
and men's souls
will rot with evil.

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,580
The earth will be drowned
in an ocean of blood...

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,080
and the flames will rise
up to scorch the heavens.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,410
Civilization will
lose all reason...

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,420
and human society will
collapse beyond recognition.

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,450
But do not be saddened by
this, children of man.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,750
Rather than destruction,
it shall be a beginning.

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,660
New life will be brought
to your decrepit world.

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,100
But it shall be life born in
pain, and all living things...

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,430
will be crucified on
the cross of fate.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,100
Amidst this chaos, the true
nature of the world...

15
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,870
will be revealed in whole and
its true form shall be restored.

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,570
When this happens, man will,
for the first time...

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,550
be freed of the yoke of the old
gods and regain self-determination.

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,810
Many have tried,
but none can escape...

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,750
the destiny that
is called evolution.

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,790
The king of the underworld,
awakened from his long sleep...

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,760
tempts mankind towards chaos.

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,800
Here, human history ends.

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,360
A new age of
life is beginning.

24
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,780
Having heard that his
archeologist father had...

25
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,110
contracted an illness,

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,910
Masao Sera and his mother
journeyed to his new posting...

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,110
at some ancient ruins
in the Himalayan mountains.

28
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,750
It was almost as if
he'd become an animal.

29
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,730
Dad!

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,540
There, Masao saw a horrifying
demon resurrection ceremony.

31
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,890
You will be spared from seeing
the coming hell on earth.

32
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,790
Using an ocean of blood,
an ancient seal was broken...

33
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,560
and countless demons were loosed
to spread across the Earth.

34
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,440
The campus Masao attended,
Motomichi Campus...

35
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,970
has earned the nickname
of Nightmare Campus...

36
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,250
because it is overrun
with gang violence.

37
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,850
However, since the great
Himalayan earthquake...

38
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,830
people with superhuman
powers have been appearing...

39
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,590
and conditions there
changed radically.

40
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,860
What's happening?

41
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,100
Some began to see their
true, demonic forms awaken.

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,940
What's happening?

43
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,550
Over there?

44
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,450
And then, one day, Masao
Sera, who had been...

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,150
assumed killed in the great
Himalayan quake...

46
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,280
suddenly returned to the campus
in a violent blast of energy.

47
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,900
It can't be... That little
wuss Sera has power like that?

48
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,230
Two gang leaders, Abe and Reiko,
hoping to gain...

49
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,240
the power Masao possessed,
involved Yuuko Someya...

50
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,970
a young woman who loves
Masao, in their plans.

51
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,680
Look at how hard
her nipples are!

52
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,420
Stop it! Don't touch her!

53
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,980
Shut up!

54
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,790
Masao, who had lost his memory
of the events in the Himalayas...

55
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,560
learned that a demon named
Esedess now existed within him.

56
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,900
The battle going on within
him was almost too much.

57
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,060
Who are you?

58
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,300
My name is Esedess.
Release me.

59
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,180
That's it
Just let yourself go.

60
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,780
Releasing Masao's sexual desire...

61
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,020
the demon lord
Esedess finally awakened.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,330
You'll pay for hurting Reiko!

63
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,870
The neighborhood
was covered in flames...

64
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,140
and Abe and Reiko
could only cower before...

65
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,970
the unstoppable
might of Esedess.

66
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,450
Little fool! You think
you can defeat Esedess!

67
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,350
And one other person was there...

68
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,330
to witness the rebirth
of the demon lord Esedess:

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,630
Akira Mido, Masao's best friend.

70
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,260
This is Esedess?

71
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,260
This is Masao's power?

72
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,210
Masao Sera, with the demon lord
Esedess existing within him...

73
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,900
now embarks
on a grand destiny.

74
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,380
Can we really get power here?

75
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,780
Really.

76
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,720
You all have hidden power.
Like what he has.

77
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,460
Now, then, let us begin.

78
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,170
What the...?

79
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,470
What's happening?

80
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,060
You... son of a...!

81
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,990
All that's left is you, Masao.

82
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,530
What the...?

83
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,310
Looks like you're okay now.

84
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,460
How long was I out?

85
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,230
- A week.
- I see...

86
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,130
Looks like he
really messed you up.

87
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,940
Anything happen while
I was unconscious?

88
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,440
Hyuga's guys are up to something.

89
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,250
And Masao Sera's coming
to class tomorrow.

90
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,640
S-sera?

91
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,220
Yes.

92
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,710
Whatever.

93
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,980
Hey! Hey! Hey!

94
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,710
What?

95
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,690
It's Sera!

96
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,060
Masao Sera's on the campus!

97
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,670
Hey, did you hear
about Sera's house?

98
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, it was caught
in that explosion.

99
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,340
He should be dead.

100
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,640
First he somehow gets back from
the Himalayas and now this!

101
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,350
And did you see how
messed up Abe is?

102
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,440
I hear Sera did that to him.

103
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,050
Yeah. Me, too.

104
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,810
Sera is coming!

105
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,430
Good... Good morning.

106
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,450
Sera, I wanna talk to you.

107
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,730
Is he all right?

108
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,790
This looks bad, man!

109
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,800
Do you remember what
happened, Lord Esedess?

110
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,350
I'm not Esedess.
I'm Masao Sera.

111
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,250
I know that something named
Esedess exists inside of me.

112
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,120
I don't know when he might
burst out of me again.

113
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,020
It could even happen now.

114
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,420
Look, I don't know
what you want from me...

115
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,090
but I just want
to be left alone.

116
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,170
Please.

117
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,430
Hold on a sec!

118
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,170
Are you saying you
control Lord Esedess?

119
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,850
I'll be damned if
I let him control me.

120
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,250
What do you think?

121
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,760
I like him. There may be more
to this guy than I thought.

122
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,390
Things are gettin' interestin'!

123
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,630
You're all right?

124
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,800
You're sure nothing
happened to you?

125
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,060
Yeah.

126
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,100
He seems a lot more macho now.

127
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,470
There's something odd about him.

128
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,880
Yeah.

129
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,590
Look, Masao.

130
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,790
You can still stay at my home.
Won't you change your mind?

131
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,230
What's with you, Akira?
You just keep saying that.

132
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,040
Masao.

133
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,270
You've changed.

134
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,570
Huh? You... You think so?

135
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,780
Yuuko!

136
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,410
Well, I'd better go.

137
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,520
What's up, Yuuko?

138
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,190
Nothing. I just thought
I'd make something for you.

139
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,210
Really? What are
you going to make?

140
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,640
Well, I have curry and...

141
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:45,300
My name is Esedess!
Release me!

142
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,300
Release me! Release me!

143
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,310
Release your desires!

144
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,320
I am within you!

145
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,310
I am Masao Sera!

146
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,260
What's wrong?

147
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,260
Lt... It's nothing.

148
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,660
Okay.

149
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,930
Well, see you.

150
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,000
R-right.

151
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,850
So, where to now?

152
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,760
What was...?

153
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,870
Why, Masao?

154
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,200
Why won't you accept
the demon within you?

155
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,530
If this keeps up,
then you'll...!

156
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,020
Would you check out those tits!

157
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,460
Oh, lemme taste those lips!

158
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,050
Isn't her hair beautiful?

159
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,160
Who is she, anyway?

160
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,790
Don't you know?
She's the new campus doctor.

161
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,890
Yeah. Dr. Yumi Mikogami.

162
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,650
Oh, she's so pretty.

163
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,520
Dr. Mikogami... She's beautiful
and sophisticated...

164
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,460
Why can't I be like her?

165
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,160
Satomi! Satomi!

166
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,200
She'll hear you.

167
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,390
Miss Someya.

168
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,130
Akira...

169
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,170
May I speak with you?

170
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,930
Sure.

171
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,780
The game's afoot.

172
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,540
So, what's this about?

173
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,490
Hasn't Masao seemed
a bit strange lately?

174
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,560
I know what you want to say.
That it's like...

175
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Like he's been possessed
by a demon, right?

176
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,040
Then why do you stay with him?
Doesn't it scare you?

177
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,170
It isn't like I'm not scared...

178
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,910
but Masao's fighting
whatever it is inside of him.

179
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,080
That's why... That's why I...!

180
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,070
So, she's the obstacle.

181
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,450
Everything with Yuuko is just
Masao this and Masao that!

182
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,670
A... Akira?

183
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,350
She's Yuuko Someya's friend...

184
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,860
Great.
I didn't know he was here!

185
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,860
Miss Orikawa, you want
Miss Someya back for yourself?

186
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,370
Just like I...

187
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,340
want Masao.

188
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,200
No, not here...!

189
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,360
Finally! We're done!

190
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,020
- Let's go home.
- I'm beat.

191
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,620
Hang in there!

192
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,670
No! Somebody will...!

193
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,940
Don't worry.
They can't see us.

194
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,580
No...

195
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,850
and during the game the ball
caught her right in the face!

196
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,620
God, what an idiot!

197
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,940
Hm? What's this?

198
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,710
No!

199
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,470
Hey, how'd THESE get here?

200
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,210
- Gross!
- Whose is that?

201
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,510
You clear on this?
The big showdown's coming.

202
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,870
That's what we're
saving our powers for!

203
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,880
It can't just be these idiots.
Someone's pulling their strings.

204
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,670
Who...?

205
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,710
- What's up?
- Who's there?

206
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,550
What's up, Mido?

207
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,890
I can't use my powers!

208
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,900
Have a victory party.
Take her.

209
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,930
Hyuga?

210
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,760
No! No, Esedess! No!

211
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,960
Hey! Boss!

212
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,700
Boss Sera!

213
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,030
Boss, here!

214
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,180
Boss, wait!

215
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,910
What's going on?
Why was Yuuko...?

216
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,180
How or why's kinda beside
the point. It's done.

217
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:27,150
"We have Yuuko Someya. Meet us
in the main auditorium at 10PM."

218
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,690
Hyuga sent me this himself,
so it's on the level.

219
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,830
Masao, you're their target.

220
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,400
But, why Yuuko...?

221
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,340
Boss!

222
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,410
Reiko!

223
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,280
I know who's
behind Hyuga's guys.

224
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,250
It's Akira Mido!

225
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,750
A... Akira?

226
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,380
Well, Boss?

227
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,640
I'm their target.
I'll go alone.

228
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:30,390
Masao! That message was
a direct challenge to me.

229
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,050
There's no way in
hell I'm not going!

230
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:38,570
Besides, we had to settle things
with them eventually. Right?

231
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,460
Right!

232
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:52,070
Besides, I kinda like you.

233
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,440
Not 'cuz you're Esedess.

234
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,140
I like Masao Sera.

235
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,140
Thank you.

236
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,710
All right, people!
Plow the road for us!

237
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,490
Go!

238
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,300
It's begun.

239
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,130
Shit! Reiko, go!

240
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,530
Okay!

241
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,140
Masao!
We'll handle these guys!

242
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,870
Get going inside!

243
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,640
Keep them busy!

244
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,880
Sure! We've got 'em!

245
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,890
Haven't had to push the
engines to full for a while!

246
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,930
Akira?

247
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,190
I'm glad you came, Masao.

248
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,930
So, care to join in the fun?

249
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,940
Oh, yes. THIS is the woman
you want, isn't it?

250
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,010
Yuuko!

251
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,880
Be true to your desires, Masao.

252
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:14,010
Release your powers and the
entire world can be yours!

253
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,120
Akira... Are you really
the Akira Mido I knew?

254
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,260
Or has a demon taken
over your soul?

255
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,620
Masao.

256
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,030
You really don't
remember anything.

257
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,770
When the demons appear on earth...

258
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,210
their human hosts
aren't chosen by chance.

259
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,050
The demon chooses the human,
and the human chooses the demon.

260
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,050
Masao! You, too, have
been chosen by a demon!

261
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,790
Yes! By the
mightiest demon of all:

262
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,990
The demon lord Esedess!

263
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:59,190
Do you know how happy
I was when I realized that?

264
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:04,930
That my oldest, dearest friend was
host to the demon lord Esedess?

265
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,910
I realized it had to be fate!

266
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,280
But then you refused to awaken.

267
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,610
Why, Esedess?
Have you forgotten me?

268
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,350
I, who fought by your
side in ancient times?

269
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,350
I am the demon lord Aquifel!

270
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,090
I, who, with you, was one
of the shining jewels...

271
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,930
of the underworld!

272
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,690
The demon lord Aquifel!

273
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,700
Awaken, Esedess!

274
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:43,030
Or else I will bury you
with my own hands!

275
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,710
Why, Akira?

276
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,050
Still you call me by
that name? Very well!

277
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,400
Why, Esedess?
Why only this much?

278
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,720
You haven't awakened completely.

279
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,750
Very well!

280
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:31,250
Then I'll rip those
human feelings out of you!

281
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,620
This woman has become
a chain to bind you!

282
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,100
Stop it!

283
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,430
I will free you from
these bonds now!

284
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,200
Esedess, give me the power!

285
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,610
The power to kill him!
The power to save Yuuko!

286
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,450
Take my soul and
come to me! ESEDESS!

287
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,140
It’ll take more
than that, Esedess!

288
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,850
Do you know
this place, Masao?

289
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,420
It's the spot
where you returned!

290
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,460
Take in the demonic
energy and awaken!

291
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,160
Take it, or die!

292
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,440
What the...?

293
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,950
Masao!

294
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,870
It's all going as we planned.

295
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,440
You see, Esedess? You see
this incredible power?

296
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,880
Now that the Gods' seal is
broken, the world is ours!

297
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,290
What the...?

298
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,210
Yes, Esedess!

299
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,240
If he doesn't stop...

300
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,390
Esedess, if you don't stop,
you'll kill her!

301
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:10,170
Miss Someya
Please... Stop him.

302
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,640
Stop Masao.

303
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,980
Stop Masao...?
Akira, is that you?

304
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,850
It can't be!

305
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,660
Masao!

306
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,940
NO! MASAO!

307
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,610
Now you are truly
the demon lord Esedess...

308
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,060
Masao!
