1
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,276
Here we go.

2
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:11,239
Oops.

3
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,212
Hello there!

4
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,747
I'm Alice, the mistress of the house.

5
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,186
What? You want to introduce yourself?

6
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,531
He's Yukichi.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,331
This episode is about a love
story with married women.

8
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,331
Speaking of married women...

9
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,239
Here we go!

10
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,508
How do I look?

11
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,178
Model: Natsume Kawamura

12
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,789
What? It痴 no good because there
isn't a bird printed on her apron?

13
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,394
That痴 a good point.

14
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,288
See you next time.

15
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,951
Cherry Blossoms...

16
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,987
It's been a year...

17
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:44,901
This is...

18
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,067
When Rokuro was cleaning his
closet, he found that photo.

19
00:01:55,982 --> 00:02:00,510
A picture of a sad widow who
remembers her late husband...

20
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,180
This is gonna be a great picture.

21
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,350
What do you mean by that, Mikoto?

22
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:11,553
I'm not gonna give you the picture,
I'm living on these pictures.

23
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:12,592
What?

24
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:18,168
I mean we shouldn't depend on Rokuro.

25
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,670
If Rokuro works so hard
at his part-time job...

26
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,342
...he may fail the university
entrance exam for seventh time.

27
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,909
And people will call him...

28
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,306
..."Shichiro" Momota.

29
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:38,083
Wait, if he had seven in his
name, it would be lucky for him...

30
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,322
Funny.

31
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,359
I got a picture of the
precious smile of a cry baby!

32
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:51,733
You look better when you're smiling.

33
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,744
Then, see you later!

34
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,344
Ouch!

35
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,750
Brother Rokuro!

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,317
Mikoto!

37
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,553
Have you been causing trouble again?

38
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,059
No, that's not true!

39
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,553
Right, Chiho?

40
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,525
Rokuro...

41
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,803
Thank you for the picture.

42
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,602
I'll cherish this picture.

43
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,430
No problem at all.

44
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,373
I hope I wasn't being insensitive...

45
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,441
Don't be so cocky!

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,304
Well...

47
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,718
Daddy, come quickly.

48
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,288
Can I tell one more thing?

49
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,954
You're still young.

50
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,851
Don't you need a guy
you can depend on?

51
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,559
For example...

52
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,496
I'm much stronger than I look.

53
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:58,303
I only love Ryuhei.

54
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,706
That's enough for me.

55
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,074
Chiho.

56
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,883
Ryuhei.

57
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,017
I'm fine.

58
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,383
I can manage by myself.

59
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,502
Sister!

60
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,700
Know anyone in this apartment building?

61
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,434
Oops, sorry.

62
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,282
You have big breasts...

63
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,742
just like Mom!

64
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:47,915
Also...

65
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,424
You smell good like my mom.

66
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,219
Do you live in this apartment building?

67
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,594
I'm Konomi Momota.

68
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:06,932
Daddy!

69
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,901
You're so late!

70
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,110
You're too fast.

71
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm a fast runner.

72
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,211
Excuse me.

73
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,515
You have a grown up child.

74
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,417
Oh no.

75
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,124
How can I explain?

76
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,797
She's more like my sister.

77
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,734
Daddy is younger than my brother.

78
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,769
A-Anyway, do you have anything to
do with this apartment building?

79
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,170
This is a nice apartment building.

80
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:49,811
Well, that's true. The rents are
cheap, and it's close to the station.

81
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:50,950
It's not a bad deal.

82
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,085
Appearing everywhere.
It's not a bad deal.

83
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:52,218
Appearing everywhere.

84
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:52,952
Appearing everywhere.
But many residents are peculiar.

85
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:53,319
But many residents are peculiar.

86
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,087
Owner of the sex toy shop.
But many residents are peculiar.

87
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:54,187
Owner of the sex toy shop.

88
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,779
Owner of the sex toy shop.
On top of that, the landlord is a pervert...

89
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,981
I mean he's certainly
an eccentric person.

90
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,458
I can't recommend this place to you.

91
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,720
It sounds fun, doesn't it?

92
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,660
I'll see you around.

93
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,529
So your name is...

94
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,001
I'm Satoru Tsuzaki.

95
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,707
I'm Kanae, Kanae Hasuma.

96
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,200
Oh no.

97
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,510
Are you excited by the sight of
the underwear of a middle aged woman?

98
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,311
You're so cute, Mr. Tsuzaki.

99
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:43,703
Wife Eater

100
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:49,976
Wife Eater

101
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:53,639
Directed by Hiromi Yokoyama

102
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,575
Produced by Pink Pineapple

103
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:03,255
Chance One: Wanna Have Sex With Me?

104
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,700
Chiho...

105
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:21,605
Crying won't bring your husband back.

106
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,373
Ryuhei...

107
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,694
I've decided not to cry anymore.

108
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,364
I'm sorry, Ryuhei, I'm going
to be stronger from tomorrow on.

109
00:07:55,908 --> 00:08:01,847
But tonight, let me see you in my dream.

110
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,052
Ryuhei?

111
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,455
If you cry like that all the time...

112
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,996
it's going to be hard for
your husband to rest in peace.

113
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,335
You're hurting yourself by crying.

114
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,815
Well, he is...

115
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:39,985
Um...

116
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,252
No, never mind.

117
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,423
Well, I'll do my best today.

118
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,369
I haven't seen you for
a long time, Ms. Mikoto.

119
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,938
Don't be so polite.

120
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:08,873
You're older than me, you
can be more friendly with me.

121
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,982
Well then,
cutie Mikoto...

122
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,449
You idiot! That's way too friendly.

123
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:21,752
What are you thinking calling
a grown up woman "cutie"?

124
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,028
You...

125
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,154
Anyhow, take a look at these.

126
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,589
C-Chiho!

127
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,529
You, bonehead!

128
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,572
You gotta give me money!

129
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,101
These are high quality
and very expensive.

130
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:50,279
Well, I changed my mind.

131
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,145
Bye now!

132
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,186
Hi, Chiho.

133
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,696
Oh, Hello.

134
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:00,993
Well...
Well...

135
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,398
Nothing...
Nothing...

136
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,770
Mikoto, play with me outside!

137
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,500
I'm very busy thinking
about making money.

138
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,773
Fine then, I'll play with Daddy.

139
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,814
No, wait, he is also busy right now.

140
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,984
I have to prepare lunch, so excuse me.

141
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,387
Are you going to take
a bookkeeping exam?

142
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:34,324
Well, I need at least a bookkeeping
certificate in order to get a job.

143
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,768
I have a bookkeeping certificate.

144
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:38,962
Really?

145
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,234
But it's nothing special.

146
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,047
You're smart, Tsuzaki.

147
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,718
Well, I don't even
have a driver's license.

148
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,652
I'm very slow and...

149
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,586
Oh, what am I saying?

150
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:02,922
Well...

151
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,629
I-If you don't mind, I can help
you out with your studying...

152
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,901
Oh, I'm sorry.

153
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,841
I'm moving in here today,
my name is Kanae Hasuma.

154
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:25,884
Oh?

155
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,815
I met you yesterday, you are...

156
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,218
...Tsuzaki.

157
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,715
Um...

158
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,118
I'm Kanae,
Ka-na-e.

159
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,556
Don't you remember?

160
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,656
Of course, I do.

161
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,897
Hello, I'm Chiho Mizumori.

162
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:00,981
Stupid.

163
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:03,847
Wait...

164
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,688
Why am I angry at him?

165
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:25,935
Hi!

166
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,071
Natsume?

167
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,311
Good morning!

168
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,245
What's the matter with you?

169
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,944
You're supposed to dream at night.

170
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,514
No, Stephanie, don't be rude.

171
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,690
Nah, she won't mind it.

172
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,521
Right?

173
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,188
N-No...

174
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,836
Hmm, are you angry about something?

175
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,674
You'll get wrinkles on your forehead.

176
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,669
No, I'm not.

177
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,577
You had a fight with
Tsuzaki, didn't you?

178
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,481
No, I'm not angry at all!

179
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,720
No, I'm not angry...

180
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,158
Do you like it?

181
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,829
Yes, I do.

182
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,666
You can call me Master.

183
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,470
"Master."

184
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,874
How elegant it sounds!

185
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,450
I've got some interesting stuff.

186
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,951
The regular customers
love the wide selection.

187
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,364
I don't think that one
will fit you, Ms. Hasuma.

188
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,469
We also do custom-made,
if you're interested.

189
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,031
Oh, I don't need you to
tell me your measurements.

190
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:12,042
Bust 38 inch, waist 24 inch, hip
35, and brassiere size is 32G.

191
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,577
Am I right or what?

192
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,688
Well, I'll leave it to your imagination.

193
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,457
Whenever you need it, just let me know.

194
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,027
I have to go now, I still have
to clean up my new apartment.

195
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:33,695
But that must be hard while your
husband is away on a business trip.

196
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,707
I already have a very dependable helper.

197
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:48,916
Thanks for leaving
me all this trouble.

198
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:58,151
You have to make this up to me.

199
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,327
Aren't these underwear too small?

200
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,501
Some people prefer it that way.

201
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,101
Ms. Kanae.

202
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,872
This must be the last one.

203
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,045
Thank you, you were such a big help.

204
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,714
Daddy, you're great.

205
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,244
Don't mention it.

206
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,223
Konomi?

207
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,722
I haven't seen her for a while.

208
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,886
I don't think she goes out alone.

209
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,724
I don't see Tsuzaki, either.

210
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,290
I should have played with her.

211
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,505
Would you move to the right a little?

212
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,369
Okay.

213
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,141
That's good.

214
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,080
Wow.

215
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,316
That's so cute!

216
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,748
Isn't it so?

217
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:02,951
Oh no!

218
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:05,860
Oh no, no...

219
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:07,860
Oh no!

220
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,866
So sorry.

221
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,763
Never mind.

222
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,036
Yes!

223
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,442
Let me get the door.

224
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,509
Wow, sister!

225
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,409
This is the last one...

226
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,889
What are you doing here?

227
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,253
This is not your home!

228
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,953
Just come in here and look!

229
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,050
What is it?

230
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,755
Don't they look good together?

231
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,757
Daddy and Mommy.

232
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,494
What the...

233
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,937
Is that you, Tsuzaki?

234
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:46,795
What?

235
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,972
M-Mikoto!

236
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,873
Oh my!

237
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,550
So sorry.

238
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,654
More guests?

239
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,561
C-Chiho!

240
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,001
What are you doing?

241
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,865
You got me wrong.

242
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,341
I'm so sorry.

243
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,681
Konomi must've caused
you a lot of trouble.

244
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,246
I was a good girl.

245
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,879
Right, Mommy?

246
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,555
Don't call her mom.

247
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,385
Never mind, I'm glad she calls me that.

248
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,422
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,525
By the way, come here, Tsuzaki.

250
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,355
Huh?

251
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,826
She may not look like it,
but Chiho is a jealous woman.

252
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,639
You'll have a hard time
getting things straight with her.

253
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,006
However...

254
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,968
maybe I can talk to her for you.

255
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,074
This will do.

256
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,075
But be careful, there's
no smoke without fire.

257
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,844
And if you play with
fire, you can get burned.

258
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,119
Is this really okay with your husband?

259
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,287
What?

260
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,026
That I visit your place while he's away.

261
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,801
Don't worry, he's an understanding man.

262
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,628
But you really don't
have to do this for me.

263
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,530
Don't expect too much.

264
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,806
I'll be able to enjoy
whatever you cook.

265
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,106
Are you challenging me?

266
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,113
I'm going to make you say
"Delicious!", so be prepared.

267
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:53,091
You really look like him...

268
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,458
What do you mean?

269
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,500
I just think you're so cute.

270
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,437
You like Chiho, don't you?

271
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,240
W-What are you talking about?

272
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,836
C-Chiho...

273
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:14,010
I mean, Ms. Mizumori has
just lost her husband...

274
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,020
Besides, she doesn't
care about me at all.

275
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,378
You think?

276
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,815
I think she likes you, too.

277
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,766
If you are a real man,
you've got to be strong.

278
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,239
I'll be on your side and cheer you on.

279
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:49,049
Actually I used to be a
cheerleader when I was in school.

280
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,683
I like cheering on other people.

281
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,715
I don't think I have a chance.

282
00:19:55,694 --> 00:20:00,654
Her husband was a really great guy,
I don't have that kind of confidence.

283
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,132
Confidence, huh?

284
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,034
Well, Tsuzaki, do you want to...

285
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,574
...have sex with me?

286
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:15,574
Ow!

287
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,416
I must be stupid.

288
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,693
She's a married woman.

289
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,759
Married women don't do things like that.

290
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,445
Then why do I care about them so much?

291
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,079
I'm sorry.

292
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,847
I didn't think you'd
be that surprised.

293
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,744
That was a tasteless joke.

294
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,353
It's no joke.

295
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,690
I can give you what you need.

296
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,263
Stay still.

297
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:20,302
What I'm about to do is a sinful thing...

298
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,038
He's a man I just met...

299
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,241
But strange...

300
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,976
...I don't feel guilty at all.

301
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:33,351
Instead, I just want him to
have more confidence in himself.

302
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,160
I want to cheer him up.

303
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:41,432
That's right, I'm going to
do my best to cheer him on.

304
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,745
Feels too tight right here.

305
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,078
Is it my fault?

306
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,882
I'll make you feel better.

307
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,000
You have a very big penis.

308
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,466
You should be more
confident in yourself.

309
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,736
Kanae...

310
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,443
I spilled some.

311
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,118
You're getting hard again.

312
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,190
Well...

313
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,658
Then, come inside me next time.

314
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,988
Feel my pussy.

315
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,142
Feels good.

316
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,545
So good.

317
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,244
Come now.

318
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,166
Did I cheer you up a little?

319
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,876
I'm sorry, I just...

320
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,804
We're both adults.

321
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,142
We have to take
responsibilities for what we do.

322
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,611
Right?

323
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,088
Especially, if you're a real man.

324
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,947
Don't get me wrong.

325
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:09,265
I just hope you and
Chiho will be together.

326
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,063
So this was a lesson for you.

327
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,598
Yes, this was a lesson.

328
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,875
Don't worry, I won't have
any serious feelings for you.

329
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,613
You shouldn't either.

330
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:27,842
Okay?

331
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,153
You can do it, you're a man.

332
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,133
Thank you.

333
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:47,399
I woke up so early, I
cooked a little too much.

334
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:52,075
Thank you so much for
sharing your cooking with me.

335
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,869
I hope you like it.

336
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,174
Yes, I'm sure I'll like it.

337
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,907
I envy you, you're
beautiful, and you can cook...

338
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,986
My husband doesn't like Japanese food...

339
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,919
so I only cook Japanese
dishes while he's away.

340
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,357
It must be hard without your husband.

341
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,821
Yes, that's true, I am lonely.

342
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:20,729
A woman's body can't stand
being alone, don't you agree?

343
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:28,603
Even when we get old, women
don't stop being women.

344
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,783
By the way...

345
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:39,152
Satoru's mind is occupied with
a girl he has a crush on.

346
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,392
Maybe you can help him out.

347
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,088
I'm the one who said that
I wouldn't get serious...

348
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,213
What am I going to do?

349
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,259
I can't help but being attracted to you...

350
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,754
I know I shouldn't do this, but...

351
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,764
Wife Eater, Chance Two.

352
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,835
Please look forward to it!
