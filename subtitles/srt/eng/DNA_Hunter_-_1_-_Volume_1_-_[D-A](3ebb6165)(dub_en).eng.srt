1
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:40,606
Oh, Youji.

2
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,603
Oh, Mai.

3
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,215
Yes, sir.

4
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,616
Please accept my condolences.

5
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,595
Thank you for your understanding.

6
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,260
You two were going to be married!
This is so unfortunate.

7
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,596
Please don't worry about work
until you feel you're ready.

8
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,441
If there's anything I can do...

9
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,807
You are like a daughter to me.

10
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,947
<i>My fiancée, Youji, died in</i>
<i>a mountain climbing expedition.</i>

11
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,678
<i>Leaving me all alone.</i>

12
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,187
<i>My last memory of him</i>
<i>is the night before he left.</i>

13
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,466
Yes...

14
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,438
Your pussy tastes good, Mai.

15
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,812
I love you, Mai.

16
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,601
Ready?

17
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,438
Yes.

18
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,408
I can feel it!

19
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,644
Why are you stopping?

20
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,950
I think I want to change positions.

21
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,850
Here we go!

22
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,184
Yes... I would like that.

23
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,076
I'm going to cum!

24
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,712
Me, too.

25
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,416
I'm cumming!

26
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,774
- Youji?
- Yeah?

27
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,508
So this will be your last
mountain climbing trip, right?

28
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,747
Yeah, this will be the last.

29
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:17,421
I wouldn't want my new bride
to worry about me.

30
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,826
My research is at a critical phase.

31
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,426
Your research?

32
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,564
Normally, how are babies made?

33
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,996
By having sex.

34
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,837
Babies are made when
the sperm and egg come together.

35
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,308
The research I'm doing
makes it possible...

36
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:42,538
...to create babies from a piece of hair,
or from saliva on this cigarette.

37
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,179
So, Youji.

38
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:53,448
When we get married,
we'll have kids the normal way...

39
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,925
...instead of something like that, right?

40
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,301
Mai...

41
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,232
Come back home safely!

42
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,106
Don't leave me all alone.

43
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,546
After the trip, we'll be together forever.

44
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,248
Promise me.

45
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,493
Youji, you lied to me!

46
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,698
You said you wouldn't leave me all alone!

47
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,832
I wanted to be your wife!

48
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,472
I wanted to have your baby!

49
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,125
You can make babies
from saliva on a cigarette.

50
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,938
<i>My condolences.</i>

51
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,302
You were Youji's fiancée.

52
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,738
I'm really sorry.

53
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,808
About what I just said...

54
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,513
Yes, we have had successful animal trials.

55
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:35,091
It is theoretically possible
to create offspring...

56
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:40,189
...using genetic material from body parts
by extracting genetic information.

57
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:46,537
While we are confident that
we can duplicate the result with humans...

58
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,404
...it is no easy feat.

59
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,203
But you said that you were confident!

60
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,875
Yes, it's not a matter of
technological hurdles here.

61
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,749
It's all financial.

62
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,520
We still need millions to continue research.

63
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,053
It's not affordable for most.

64
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,225
But I just can't give up hope!

65
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:15,199
I want to have his baby,
a living proof of our love for each other.

66
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:21,231
I would be willing to do anything,
even sell my soul to the devil!

67
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,607
If you are that desperate...

68
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,413
I understand.

69
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:34,086
Please go to our branch office;
I will give you their address.

70
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:39,648
The director's name is Mr. Soda,
and I've known him since college.

71
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:45,563
They front as a research facility
but they might be able to assist you more.

72
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,759
He might be able to help.

73
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,570
3RD RESEARCH SECTION

74
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,005
Mr. Nozaki told me about your situation.

75
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,837
You must be Mai Sakakibara.

76
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,501
Yes.

77
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,677
Call me Mr. Soda.

78
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,176
Can you promise that you will keep
our conversation strictly confidential?

79
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,046
Yes.

80
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,454
All right.

81
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,619
This way, please.

82
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,659
<i>Let me introduce myself.</i>

83
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,791
<i>I am the owner of GSC and all its branches.</i>

84
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,624
<i>It's nice to meet you.</i>

85
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,729
<i>We did a background check</i>
<i>on you prior to your arrival.</i>

86
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,139
<i>Mai Sakakibara, 22 years old.</i>

87
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,776
<i>Born in Saitama, living in Tokyo.</i>

88
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,311
<i>You are employed.</i>

89
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,984
<i>You work at Okazaki Inc.</i>
<i>As a trusted personal assistant...</i>

90
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,612
<i>... to the president of the company.</i>

91
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:46,987
<i>You lost your fiancée, the late Youji Ina,</i>
<i>our researcher, very recently.</i>

92
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,318
<i>I will briefly explain our business here.</i>

93
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,522
<i>There are many kinds</i>
<i>of women in the world.</i>

94
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:58,266
<i>Instead of having children</i>
<i>with their husbands or lovers...</i>

95
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:02,135
<i>... our clients want to have</i>
<i>exceptional children...</i>

96
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,736
<i>... with professional athletes, renowned</i>
<i>scientists, authors, painters, celebrities.</i>

97
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:10,441
<i>These are our most frequent requests</i>
<i>and our main targets.</i>

98
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,676
<i>We essentially arrange</i>
<i>to combine the client's egg...</i>

99
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,449
<i>... with the desired man's DNA material.</i>

100
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,756
<i>This is illegal, of course.</i>

101
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,090
<i>This is where you come in.</i>

102
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,525
<i>Your job is to get DNA material,</i>
<i>meaning ejaculate material...</i>

103
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:32,701
<i>... by having intercourse with the man</i>
<i>targeted by our female clients.</i>

104
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,902
<i>Mr. Soda will tell you more.</i>

105
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,273
<i>That is all I have to say.</i>

106
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,279
It's your choice.

107
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,107
Do you think you can do this job?

108
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:51,145
Well, I'm going to have to think about it.

109
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,805
When you make your decision...

110
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,208
...please call or e-mail me ASAP.

111
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,673
Ms. Mai.

112
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,073
Ms. Mai!

113
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,583
Yes.

114
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:20,946
Sir?

115
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,355
Are you feeling all right?

116
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,125
I'm feeling fine, sir. I was just thinking.

117
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,226
Okay.

118
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,454
If you say so, but you know
I'm very worried about you.

119
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,597
I appreciate your concern, sir,
but I'm really all right.

120
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,809
Youji, do you think I should do this?

121
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,649
Otherwise, I can't have your baby!

122
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,618
Please understand.

123
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,295
I'm glad you've accepted.

124
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,398
I'll introduce you to the others.

125
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,498
I've been informed about you already.

126
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,436
So you must be our newest DNA hunter.

127
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,943
You will be working with everyone here.

128
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,914
Kathleen Bartlett.

129
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,176
Hello.

130
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,946
Masumi Saeki.

131
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,209
Hiya!

132
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,421
Shiori Fukatsu.

133
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,990
Nice to meet you!

134
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,187
This is Mai Sakakibara.

135
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,426
It's nice to meet everyone.

136
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,764
Please sit.

137
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,432
Yes.

138
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,037
Please bring the case.

139
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,006
The case? Right away!

140
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,106
Let's see, it's in here somewhere

141
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,842
Here, Mai!

142
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,789
Open it, Mai.

143
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,753
You just slide this switch over like this.

144
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,391
This is our specially designed,
female condom.

145
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,991
This is used to obtain
ejaculate from your target.

146
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,397
It's made not to leak
so you don't have to worry.

147
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:24,305
Afterwards, make sure
to close off the condom opening...

148
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,602
...and put it back in the case.

149
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,477
The case is also a GSC patent.

150
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:34,352
A specialized cooling device
is built into the case to ensure viability.

151
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,854
The device runs for 48 hours.

152
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,419
This is for you.

153
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,326
Please learn to insert the condom
correctly by tonight.

154
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,255
Yes.

155
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,330
It's a good idea to use a mirror at first.

156
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,700
And let me give you some advice:

157
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,102
Don't try to move your fingers
too much when doing this.

158
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,305
You'll like it too much.

159
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,072
You're so weird, Masumi!

160
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,086
Okay Mai. I want you
to be back here at 6 p.m.

161
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,089
This will be a test
to see if you can really do this job.

162
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:29,800
<i>I want you to go out tonight</i>
<i>and obtain some ejaculate from a stranger.</i>

163
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,003
<i>It's not something that</i>
<i>can be taught with words.</i>

164
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,342
<i>This is just a test.</i>

165
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,644
<i>We'll make our final decision afterwards.</i>

166
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,848
I know you're nervous
since this is your very first time.

167
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,713
If you just relax,
you can even have some fun.

168
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,556
Yes.

169
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,387
Let's see...

170
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,260
They look like an easy target.

171
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,232
Hey, you two.

172
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,165
Let's hang out together.

173
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,881
Yes, I love it!

174
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,210
Damn, this is my lucky day today!

175
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,912
I like that!

176
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,421
Oh, yeah!

177
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,092
Yes!

178
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,095
Yes, baby!

179
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,531
Yes!

180
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,667
What's wrong?

181
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,566
Damn it.

182
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,469
Are you frigid or something?

183
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,178
At least your friend looks like
she's enjoying herself.

184
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,421
The best!

185
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,190
Baby!

186
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:30,624
I think I'm going to join those two
before I go limp.

187
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,164
No, wait!

188
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,865
Blow me.

189
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,143
She's fucking great!

190
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,011
Oh, yeah!

191
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,045
I'm gonna cum!

192
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,533
I heard about last night from Kathleen.

193
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,401
I'm sorry.

194
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,878
I'll give you another chance.

195
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,019
Please hand her the file.

196
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,555
Yes.

197
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,089
This will be your target.

198
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,058
But, I can't.

199
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,194
He's my target?

200
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:46,798
Yes, Mr. Okazaki, your current boss.

201
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,441
How can you do this to me?

202
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,400
You guys are sick!

203
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,987
How dare you say that!

204
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,455
We work based on orders from our clients!

205
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,316
We can't choose our targets.

206
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,154
You understand?

207
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,525
But, but...

208
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,758
I don't know.

209
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:21,268
Everyone that works here
does this because they have their reasons.

210
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,936
I know you have a reason
to be here as well.

211
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,043
Don't forget about that.

212
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,849
Tell me, Mai?

213
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,718
It's your decision.

214
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,984
I promise to complete my mission.

215
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,961
Mai, try to love your target
during your mission.

216
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,167
If you can't do that, this job isn't for you.

217
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,303
Got it?

218
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,273
Kathleen?

219
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,175
Yes.

220
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,152
Thank you.

221
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,017
No.

222
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,390
I'm happy to be of service.

223
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,559
But how strange!

224
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,722
You don't usually thank people.

225
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,160
Hey...

226
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,730
So Masumi...

227
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,370
Yeah?

228
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,605
Do you think Mai will be able
to pass her test this time?

229
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,575
Who knows?

230
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,683
You weren't mean to her
last night, were you?

231
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,958
Damn it, why would I do
something like that?

232
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:53,456
I hope she can pass
her test today and join us.

233
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah, me too.

234
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,514
<i>Mai, try to love your target</i>
<i>during your mission.</i>

235
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,718
<i>If you can't do that, this job isn't for you.</i>

236
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,810
Oh, Youji.

237
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,713
Please, give me the strength.

238
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,862
It's really too bad.

239
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,222
You've been through so much lately.

240
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,370
I didn't mean to resign
with such short notice, but...

241
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,263
No, no.

242
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,472
It's important to get
your life back together.

243
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:16,908
It's important to make life decisions
based on your happiness.

244
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,945
Yes.

245
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,323
I couldn't have asked for a better assistant.

246
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,223
But that's life, you know.

247
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:31,894
Well.

248
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,466
Wishes for happiness and joy in your life.

249
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,959
Wishes for your health and happiness, too.

250
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:40,870
Cheers.

251
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,667
Cheers.

252
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,717
Oh no.

253
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,523
Hey, are you feeling OK?

254
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,491
I hope I didn't keep you up too late.

255
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,151
No, I'm sorry I got so tipsy tonight.

256
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,125
I think I'll be all right.

257
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
I'll hail a cab to take you home.

258
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,359
Uh, sir...

259
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,239
Yes?

260
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,473
If you don't mind...

261
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,112
...will you grant me a final wish tonight?

262
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,843
Sleep with me?

263
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,382
But Mai!

264
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,156
Just for tonight.

265
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:39,592
I just want you to help me forget
all the sad, horrible feelings tonight.

266
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,621
- Oh sir!
- Call me Ryosuke tonight.

267
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,121
I think I've been trying
to deny my feeling for you...

268
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,994
...by telling myself you were
like a daughter.

269
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,262
<i>Try to love your target</i>
<i>during your mission.</i>

270
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,261
Tonight, sir...

271
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,303
Tonight, Ryosuke, I am your woman.

272
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,937
Thank you, Mai...

273
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,070
Oh, yes!

274
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,724
Oh, this feels so good!

275
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,731
I want you to feel good.

276
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,834
I like that you get so wet like this!

277
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,205
Don't stare too much down there.
It's embarrassing.

278
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,189
It's my turn.

279
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,076
Mai, I love it!

280
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,315
Swallow it!

281
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,740
Inside here!

282
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,513
So big!

283
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,287
I can't control myself anymore!

284
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,331
You're the best!

285
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,997
I think...

286
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,569
...I'm cumming!

287
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,576
Please cum inside me!

288
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:49,646
I'm cumming right now!

289
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,564
So Mai...

290
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,630
Yes?

291
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,704
After talking with the owner...

292
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,707
...you're in.

293
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,643
Congratulations.

294
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,603
You did well.

295
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,784
Congratulations, Mai.

296
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,979
I'm happy for you.

297
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:29,360
Mai, I'm so thrilled
you're going to be part of our team!

298
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,829
I'm glad we'll be working together!

299
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,296
I expect excellence out of
all of my DNA Hunters.

300
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:40,836
Yes!

301
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,973
Please watch over me, Youji!
