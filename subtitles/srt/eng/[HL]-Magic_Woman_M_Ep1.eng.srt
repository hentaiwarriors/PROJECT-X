1
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:20,371
Hear me. Hear my voice.

2
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:22,065
And answer me.

3
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:26,771
Cloaked in red and a banner of
blue like the beasts of fury...

4
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,508
...commanding great power,
bringing good fortune upon thee...

5
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:31,243
...but then only to take it away.

6
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,581
Broadening the power deep within...

7
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:35,677
...the ones which bring to focus.

8
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:38,013
Thou great power of
meritorious deeds...

9
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:40,490
...the glory of thee and your
supreme valor.

10
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:44,461
Bring to me once again that
which was fulfilled in the past.

11
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:45,222
Grant me the power!

12
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:49,263
Know my intentions!
The enemy is before us!

13
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:51,963
Scorch them with the heat
of your passion!

14
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,767
Give countenance to my deeds,
spirits of heaven!

15
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:57,099
To the spirits of Ignis
and Framma...

16
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,336
...I need your power.

17
00:01:58,444 --> 00:01:59,934
Gather forth in shining glory.

18
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:01,638
The valor that brings success
to my soul.

19
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:04,148
Show me and let me be
your sword!

20
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:08,076
Evoke Framma and Vintos!

21
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:11,055
Frame Window!

22
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:51,393
Only a female left.

23
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,624
So you can speak, huh?

24
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:58,736
It's telepathy. You pick it up
pretty good.

25
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:11,016
You've got a great body. Too bad
it wields a sword.

26
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:12,516
Don't mock me!

27
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:52,349
Oh, my.

28
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:54,555
Here goes...

29
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:08,540
Thanks for the fruit!

30
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:12,240
Help!

31
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:16,308
You! In the tree!

32
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:19,374
Help me!

33
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:26,114
Help me!

34
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,249
I've got to save her!

35
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:30,227
Oh, no...

36
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,497
Meruru.

37
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:34,998
Charity is an investment.

38
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:39,162
A good deed will always return
with favor.

39
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:42,366
Hang on. I'll be right there.

40
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:44,276
All right.

41
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:46,608
Huh?

42
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,779
Oh, well.

43
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,750
The six gray horses pulling the
chariot of white gold.

44
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:01,418
The heavenly spirits of victory
galloping across the heavens.

45
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:03,191
Come to me!

46
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:06,561
To save the moment,
I must taketh from Tella.

47
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,967
And place it upon my palm.

48
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:12,503
To the spirits of Arel Vintos...

49
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:15,202
...I need your power!

50
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:19,539
Evoke Arel Levitation!

51
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,849
Oh...! No...!

52
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:36,324
Heh. How unreliable.

53
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:45,202
What happened to you?

54
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:47,499
Did some goblins get you?

55
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,672
Will you just untie me?!

56
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:51,437
You call yourself a warrior?

57
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:53,640
You're a novice, aren't you?

58
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:56,681
You're the one who fell
thinking you could fly!

59
00:05:56,783 --> 00:05:58,080
You novice sorceress!

60
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:00,850
I have reached the Proficient Level.

61
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:04,445
No way! You sure don't look like
a full-fledged sorceress.

62
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:06,355
You're rude.

63
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:09,258
Maybe I'll just leave you here.

64
00:06:09,362 --> 00:06:10,920
Oh, come on!

65
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,488
I'm worried about my sister.
Hurry up and untie me!

66
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:15,495
What?

67
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:41,420
I bet you train a lot.
You've got a great body.

68
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:23,567
This place?

69
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:27,234
Is this the power of the Ogre?

70
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,240
It's like a tornado went through.

71
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,733
Is anybody here?!

72
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:35,912
Anybody here?!

73
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:39,641
Meruru, let's split up and search.

74
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:40,616
Okay.

75
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:07,074
It's my sister's sword!

76
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:15,209
It must have been
a peaceful village.

77
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,760
What happened to the child
this belongs to...?

78
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,897
I can't...

79
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:30,695
...forgive them.

80
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:35,973
Are you ready?

81
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:41,880
No matter how much you study
the chants and practice sorcery...

82
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:44,313
...if you do not have the wisdom...

83
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:49,878
...as the saying goes, "the great sword
of goblins", the "slime and gold"...

84
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:51,479
...none will be of any use.

85
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:53,752
You will eventually fail.

86
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:54,484
Yes.

87
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:58,530
Think of the purpose for taking on
this dangerous power.

88
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:00,455
Study it well...

89
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:03,262
...the true sorcery.

90
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,710
What are you going to do to me?!

91
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:18,511
You're awfully cute.
I'll have to help myself.

92
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:23,045
I don't have anything
I can give you.

93
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:25,555
But you do.

94
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:29,127
The nice, firm body you've got.

95
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:31,162
I want it.

96
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,790
What are you going to
make me do?!

97
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,764
Don't be stupid.

98
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:40,896
I'm going to make love to that
hollow between your legs.

99
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:42,338
Make love?

100
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:45,342
I'm gonna spread your legs
wide open...

101
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:49,107
...and shove my member into you,
thrusting...

102
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,513
...and twisting it around
in all sorts of ways...

103
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:53,608
...and do the dirtiest, nastiest...

104
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:58,179
...things to you until your hips give out
and you can't take any more.

105
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,383
How can you...?!

106
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:04,963
No way...!

107
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:21,436
Ow, ow, ow...

108
00:10:28,187 --> 00:10:29,916
Hear me. Hear my voice.

109
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:31,546
And answer me.

110
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:33,551
Grant me the power!

111
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:35,889
The enemy is before us!

112
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:39,296
Scorch them with the heat
of your passion!

113
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:45,395
Show me and let me be your sword!

114
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:50,134
Evoke Framma and Vintos!

115
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,649
Who do you think I am?

116
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:04,949
What'd you say?

117
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:08,925
Meruru the Sorcerer, who cometh
once in a century...

118
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,523
...is indeed I!

119
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,154
Lookin' good, Meruru!

120
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:17,160
Frame Window!

121
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,342
Thine spirit is at one with mine.

122
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:32,076
Spirits of heaven.

123
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:36,416
Hinder the intentions
of this scourge.

124
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:38,956
Cast judgment upon him
with indifference!

125
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:41,424
Reveal the power in the name of
thine greatness!

126
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:44,189
Evoke Ventum Spherics!

127
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:55,998
Why?

128
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:58,440
I practiced this so much.

129
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,239
Don't frighten me, cutie.

130
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,045
No...!

131
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:07,546
Let me go!

132
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,281
No...!

133
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,025
Looks delicious...!

134
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:20,088
No! Don't!

135
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:25,870
Let me go!

136
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:30,067
Since ancient times, the master
would send the novice on a journey...

137
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:32,610
...to be cast into a valley
of a thousand fathoms.

138
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,269
Forgive me.

139
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,705
Help me!

140
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,080
No!

141
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:41,244
No!

142
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:47,558
I'll give you my love.

143
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,820
I said no!

144
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:50,225
Stop it!

145
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,331
Stop it!

146
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:06,877
I can't get enough...

147
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:10,139
No!

148
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:16,654
No...!

149
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:37,574
It hurts!

150
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:40,244
Stop!

151
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,876
It hurts!

152
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:46,083
We must learn patience.

153
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,682
I've had to learn that as well.

154
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,717
It hurts...!

155
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:03,530
Please, no!

156
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:07,102
It'll go too deep!

157
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,910
Nice and tight!

158
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,616
Ow!

159
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:24,945
Ow!

160
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:41,464
It hurts! It hurts!

161
00:14:49,214 --> 00:14:51,739
I'll twist it around.

162
00:14:57,723 --> 00:14:58,587
No...

163
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:12,504
You're quite the woman.
Don't break apart on me.

164
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:59,348
Meruru!

165
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:03,285
Meruru!

166
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:08,285
Where did she go?

167
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:17,325
The light in the night shed.

168
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,494
Ogre Mountain!

169
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:35,076
You awake?

170
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:51,893
No! No...!

171
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,837
I'm Tia the warrior.
From the village.

172
00:16:58,944 --> 00:17:01,845
Tia?! You mean,
Luna's big sister?

173
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:04,371
Is Luna all right?

174
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,041
I'm sure she is.

175
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:07,782
And who may you be?

176
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:10,377
I'm Meruru, from
the town of Hugh.

177
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,320
I'm a sorceress of the Wiz Sect.

178
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:14,784
A wizard?

179
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:16,224
Who are they?

180
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:18,692
They were taken from the village...

181
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:27,169
...as food for the Ogre.

182
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:53,257
Hey, lady. I'm gonna have you
instead of breakfast.

183
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,299
What?! No...!

184
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,200
You've got a lot of energy considering
I just popped your cherry.

185
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,937
But I'm gonna have
a little fun first...

186
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,736
...you cutie.

187
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:09,610
Well then, I'm gonna sink
my morning staff into you.

188
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:41,545
No! Stay away from me!

189
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:46,584
What a view!

190
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:06,635
No!

191
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,700
No! W-Wait...!

192
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,227
I...

193
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:40,198
I'm sorry, Meruru.

194
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,966
Oh, yeah...

195
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:32,155
Meruru...!

196
00:20:57,683 --> 00:20:59,674
Lu-Luna...

197
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:14,029
Luna!

198
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:31,672
Stop it...!

199
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:47,022
Luna!

200
00:21:52,838 --> 00:21:54,169
Luna...

201
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,569
Are you okay?!

202
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:09,478
Wow, your sorcery was amazing!

203
00:22:11,757 --> 00:22:13,019
My...

204
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,927
Frame Window!

205
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:33,200
My sorcery did...

206
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,856
Spherics!

207
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:01,862
Meruru, you must check first
with your own eyes.

208
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,367
If you do not understand
the resurgence of the soul...

209
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:07,411
...there will be no resurgence
in your power.

210
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,343
Observe the power.

211
00:23:09,448 --> 00:23:11,643
As one who strives to attain
the highest level...

212
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,153
...you must remember that your
beautiful body is something very rare.

213
00:23:19,591 --> 00:23:22,151
You really must be...!

214
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,559
...a once-in-a-century sorcerer...

215
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:30,094
That's right! It's the sorcerer...

216
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:31,931
...Meruru!

217
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:44,111
Meruru.

218
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:45,444
Luna.

219
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:51,653
I was so scared!

220
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:58,822
Well, there were some problems
along the way...

221
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,093
...but we did see some
impressive sorcery.

222
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,364
People become adults as they
face adverse situations.

223
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,368
Right, everyone?

224
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:39,266
Are you going already, Meruru?

225
00:24:39,371 --> 00:24:41,134
Why don't you stay awhile?

226
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:44,640
I'd love to, but I'm in
the middle of training.

227
00:24:45,143 --> 00:24:46,167
I see.

228
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:48,974
Then work hard and become
a great sorceress.

229
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,172
Thank you.

230
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:53,513
Meruru, I'll work hard to become
a strong warrior.

231
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,143
Yeah, let's both do our best.

232
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:58,689
Well, good-bye.

233
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:05,856
Good-bye, Meruru!

234
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:11,290
I hope... I hope we meet again!

235
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:16,505
We'll meet again. Sometime, I'm sure!
