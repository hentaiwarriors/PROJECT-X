1
00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:04,384
Please, no!

2
00:00:06,987 --> 00:00:08,750
Let me go!

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,351
Don't do this!

4
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,262
This feels good, doesn't it?

5
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:32,467
Good!

6
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:40,886
Sister!

7
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:44,020
Sister, hang on!

8
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:45,953
Hurry up, my lady. We must go.

9
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:56,225
You can't just come here
and take her away.

10
00:00:56,903 --> 00:00:59,133
Let her go right now, or else!

11
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:11,113
All, hostile intruders...

12
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:13,410
will be...

13
00:01:13,687 --> 00:01:15,086
stopped!

14
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:18,990
Right...

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,450
now!

16
00:01:23,463 --> 00:01:25,693
I won't let you get away.

17
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:30,266
She got away.

18
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:31,598
Hitomi.

19
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:39,368
This devil finally dies.

20
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:50,556
The Holy War against the Devil

21
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:52,182
The sixth part

22
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:57,019
I heard that Kaori took a sick leave.

23
00:01:57,264 --> 00:02:00,756
There were four other people
who didn't even show up.

24
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,534
How long can
the college stay open?

25
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:18,610
Why do you bring me here?

26
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:25,154
The members of the Ootoris
never rely on men.

27
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:32,054
In the underworld, Dakini has switched
their bodies...

28
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:35,132
so they can reincarnate as witches.

29
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:36,661
So what?

30
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,872
Since long ago,
the Ootori were from the witches' family.

31
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:45,167
Rikako and her mother were
the daughters, leaders of the underworld.

32
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:49,538
I've been here to serve them
for generations.

33
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,950
Is Mao one of them?

34
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:58,351
Your sister Mao,
is not really your sister after all.

35
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,152
But she cares for you more than the Ootoris.

36
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:09,624
Himiko is attempting
to take over the Ootoris.

37
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,501
But she just wastes her time.

38
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,302
You can decide to side with her or with us.
It's totally your decision.

39
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:19,139
Do you want me to betray my mother?

40
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:22,441
What if I say no?

41
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:25,708
Maybe I should put you
out of the way here and now.

42
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:29,344
Come on! Settle up your quarrel!

43
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:39,523
My lady.

44
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,393
Eavesdropping is a terrible habit.

45
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:51,303
My lady.

46
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:57,806
If you don't hurry up, I'll take over.

47
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:02,019
Come on! No need to trouble
the head temple.

48
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:03,553
What can you do now?

49
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:11,020
Just as I thought,
you don't think much of me, do you?

50
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:14,461
If you really wanted to,
you could've saved more people.

51
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:17,036
You know that, don't you, Kaori?

52
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:21,139
Do you really care
about the Ootori's business?

53
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:24,933
You won't turn against
the head temple now?

54
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:30,742
Are you talking about Himiko?

55
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:33,485
Sometimes overconfidence
will lead to failure.

56
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,678
Just like this time.

57
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:42,784
I won't stop here.
You know that I won't.

58
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,299
Even Hitomi is going to get her revenge.

59
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,541
Something fishy's going on!

60
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:07,776
I'm warning you, get out of my way!
Stupid boys.

61
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:20,228
Kaori, how dare you!

62
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,235
I'll be back here tomorrow
when the sun is eclipsed.

63
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,168
And you'll have a lot
to worry about then, won't you?

64
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,508
Takashi, need you to do
your very best at this.

65
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:30,735
Leave it to me.

66
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,877
We're almost there, Rikako.

67
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:39,950
- Hitomi, let me take care of it!
- No!

68
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:42,844
Bonno!

69
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,450
Let me go, let me go!

70
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:54,357
She won't kill the classmates...

71
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:57,398
even though she looks pretty unfriendly.

72
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:02,868
Kaori, you're dead meat!

73
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:08,541
Takashi!

74
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:12,374
You see, Kaori is going to launch
herself forth.

75
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:15,880
Very well, let's put an end
to our struggle.

76
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,784
Kundalimyoou!

77
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:34,466
Stop!

78
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:37,607
Wake up, people!

79
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,277
Stop!

80
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:47,516
How can you do this to me?

81
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:54,323
No!

82
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:01,764
Help me! Help me!

83
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,734
Hitomi, let me save you!

84
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,314
No, Bonno!

85
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:20,007
If you go, they'll be hurt.
Don't you know that?

86
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,382
Stop!

87
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:23,385
Stop!

88
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:48,770
Hitomi!

89
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,694
Please no!

90
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:22,709
No! I'm begging you!

91
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:28,142
Stop!

92
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:33,486
Akira.

93
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:36,389
Do you know that Hitomi
was gangbanged?

94
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,421
Yes, and I heard it had something
to do with your sister.

95
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:41,993
My sister?

96
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,771
It hurts.

97
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,082
Please stop.

98
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:11,496
Not anymore.

99
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,139
Hitomi!

100
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:25,203
Bonno, don't look at me!

101
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:29,777
Please stop. No! No!

102
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:00,234
Stop!

103
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:24,600
No, please, no...

104
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,882
Protection Cloak!

105
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,095
Hitomi!

106
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:04,799
Mao, what are you doing here?

107
00:11:04,877 --> 00:11:06,868
Don't worry. You're safe now, dear.

108
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:09,973
I can't believe this.

109
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,348
Mao, I'll let you go this time.

110
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:17,315
Stop Mao!

111
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:31,701
This spell is not from my sister.

112
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:40,171
Merani, stop! Mao!

113
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:45,641
Kaori, after all this time
I can finally get rid of you two now.

114
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:48,886
I won't let the chance slip by!
You know that.

115
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,014
No!

116
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,756
Mao!

117
00:11:57,864 --> 00:11:59,161
No!

118
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:04,761
Don't touch me.

119
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,839
No!

120
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:33,020
No!

121
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:46,267
Mao!

122
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:51,341
Don't look at me!

123
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,581
It feels good.

124
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:38,488
Hitomi.

125
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:46,166
I'm coming!

126
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,767
Me too.

127
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,824
How sweet you two.

128
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:17,430
You can both go to hell, silly girls.

129
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:19,070
Unbelievable.

130
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:23,965
Merani, I thought you'd take care
of these students.

131
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,768
Isn't that right?

132
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:28,540
You know, I'm not a real teacher anyway.

133
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:30,616
I'm the evil spirit.

134
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,192
Hitomi, are you okay?

135
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:17,890
Leave me alone.

136
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,064
Hitomi.

137
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:27,404
There won't be a next time.

138
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:33,206
Are you going to keep fighting like this?

139
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:39,777
Hitomi probably doesn't know yet.

140
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,112
Wait, she should already know,
I'm her sister.

141
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:55,189
I'm sorry. It wasn't my place...

142
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:59,160
It's okay. Merani should have never existed.

143
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:02,271
The solar eclipse will be here tomorrow.

144
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:06,968
Himiko will have her last ritual.

145
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:09,477
I wonder if Mao is okay.

146
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:10,673
I hope.

147
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:13,815
No, stop!

148
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:21,151
I hope she won't be set back.

149
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:24,919
Don't worry. My lady
has become very strong.

150
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,108
Hitomi, what are you thinking?

151
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:44,139
I'll kill if my mother says so.

152
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:48,476
I've decided!

153
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:52,451
I'm going to stop Auntie Himiko
and get you out of this mess.

154
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:08,632
Tomorrow we'll be apart.

155
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:13,467
If my mother wants to take my life,
I'll obey her.

156
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:21,685
Sorry I can't stay with you anymore.

157
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,446
Here we go.

158
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:58,045
Mao, you've already been awakened
by Dakini's power.

159
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:03,219
But in case you can't be merciless,
I'll have to...

160
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:28,481
My lady.

161
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:42,725
Auntie Himiko, I won't easily
let you get Hitomi.

162
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:48,867
Mother, I feel so...

163
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,141
Hitomi!

164
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:57,004
Himiko! What are you doing to Hitomi?

165
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:36,347
Soon, my sister will be mine.

166
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:41,055
Mother...

167
00:19:56,976 --> 00:20:00,468
I finally meet you, Rikako, my sister.

168
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:11,186
Hitomi. Hitomi.

169
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:17,985
What goes around comes around.

170
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,122
Like the fight between
mother and Auntie Himiko.

171
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,528
Then Mao and Hitomi got involved.

172
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:27,602
Maybe this is the karma
of the Ootori family.

173
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:29,602
Sister!

174
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:37,041
Hitomi!

175
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:42,977
I won. Now my beloved Rikako is all mine!

176
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:56,090
Hang in there, Mao!

177
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:58,295
Sister!

178
00:20:58,504 --> 00:20:59,698
Take my power!

179
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:27,058
What happened?
Has Rikako come back?

180
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:01,059
No! I'll try again!
I'll bring back Rikako.

181
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,861
We've lost to the Ootoris.

182
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:06,760
I'll die with you, mother, I promise.

183
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:10,431
No! Where's my sister? No!

184
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:12,544
- Let's die together.
- No!

185
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,770
Hitomi!

186
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:18,507
It's Mao!

187
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:24,678
Hitomi, I can only save you.
You must come here now!

188
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,720
No, I can't leave my mother behind.
You now that.

189
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,452
- Don't do that!
- Goodbye, beloved sister.

190
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:37,059
Goodbye.

191
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:41,133
Hitomi!

192
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:34,857
Hitomi.
