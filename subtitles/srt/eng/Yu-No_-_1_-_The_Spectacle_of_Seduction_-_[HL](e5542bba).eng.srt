1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,640
I want to see you see you again, Father.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,710
Did I hear something?

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,440
Damn it, I can't find them.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,920
Where could they possibly be?

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,000
It's 10:00 already.

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,610
What could they talking about this late?

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,440
This is so nostalgic.

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,980
Do you remember how the three of us
used to come here with Kodai, Mitsuki?

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,580
Ayumi, you know I did not come here
to reminisce about old times.

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,720
If it's about the stone,
I can't tell you anything right now.

11
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,060
You should trust me, Ayumi.

12
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:57,790
Mitsuki!

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,000
Stop!

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,830
We are best friends, right?

15
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,870
What are you?

16
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,580
What's going on?

17
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,260
What is this ring?

18
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,860
I never would have thought...

19
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,350
I would find the key like this.

20
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,460
Mitsuki, Ayumi!

21
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,830
Takuya, what are you doing here?

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,810
Hand the ring over to me.

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,010
Mitsuki?

24
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,350
You have no need for it.

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,180
What is this about, Mitsuki?

26
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,180
Stop, Mitsuki, you're not like yourself
at all today, stop this!

27
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,750
Hurry up!

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,680
Go, Takuya!

29
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,080
Hurry Ayumi!

30
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,190
Takuya, wait!

31
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,280
Run Ayumi!

32
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,860
Takuya wait!

33
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,360
Wait, Takuya!

34
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,270
First episode: The spectacle of seduction

35
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,870
Would you like to borrow any underwear?

36
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,110
I'm all right.

37
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,780
It's no problem, really.

38
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,480
Well, I'll leave the bath towel here, okay?

39
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,620
Thank you.

40
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,850
Hey Ayumi!

41
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,260
Who is it?

42
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,890
Ayumi!

43
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,840
Yes I'm Ayumi.

44
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,400
Who are you?

45
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,070
Are you okay, you're not hurt?

46
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,170
You, get out, you sick pervert!

47
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,840
What are you talking about,
it's me, Takuya.

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,950
Takuya?

49
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,110
I'm going to catch a cold!

50
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,550
Stop, wait!

51
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,950
Ayumi, please wait!

52
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,760
Miyo, what are you doing here?

53
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,640
Mitsuki did what?

54
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,540
Yeah, and she was going to shoot me!

55
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,780
I'm flattered that you would be willing
to protect me even in your dreams.

56
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,960
But Mitsuki is my very, best friend.

57
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,690
I couldn't have been dreaming, really!

58
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,860
My god!

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,800
That was what this whole mess was about?

60
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,600
You're just such a troublemaker.

61
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,130
So Miyo, what are you doing here?

62
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,470
It's none of your business, Takuya.

63
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,070
Is having her here a problem?

64
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,880
Ayumi, I didn't know you two were friends.

65
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,620
Do you guys not like each other?

66
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,390
We were both walking back home...

67
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,130
when a sudden rainstorm soaked us.

68
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,640
You really have no reason to be
jealous or anything.

69
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,340
Ayumi, you have it all wrong, because
I have no interest whatsoever in Miyo.

70
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,540
Same to you.

71
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,820
It's hard to believe that a barbarian
like you is Ayumi's stepson!

72
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,690
Ten o'clock again.

73
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,030
Takuya, please walk Miyo back to her house.

74
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,060
That's all right!

75
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,170
But, it's not safe to walk alone at night!

76
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,570
It's not my fault that she's been
hanging out here until it's late!

77
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,370
Wait, I was investigating the lake.

78
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,080
What I do is really none of your business!

79
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,850
I'm leaving now!

80
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,220
What was that?

81
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,590
Why can't you be nicer?

82
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,460
Are you listening? Hey, Takuya?

83
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,940
Was that only a dream?

84
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,110
But this ring is proof.

85
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,940
It always seems like Miyo always
looks perfect, don't you think?

86
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,050
I don't understand why someone with her
grades is here for a review session.

87
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,150
Hey Takuya!

88
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,490
So, you're here for the review?

89
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,740
If I recall, Canna's her name, I think.

90
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,600
You know there's rumours about her.

91
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,110
Rumours, like what kind?

92
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,280
I thought you might know more about that.

93
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,980
What makes you think that?

94
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,490
I just thought, never mind!

95
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,690
Wow, fighting so early already?

96
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,690
Miss Eriko!

97
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,700
I would be happy to give you
relationship counseling.

98
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,470
What relationship?

99
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,030
Yeah, she's not my girlfriend!

100
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,070
Right, I would never pick you!

101
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,640
Whatever.

102
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,740
Miss Mitsuki!

103
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,480
Don't stare at me so much!

104
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,780
The usual place, after class, okay?

105
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,820
I'm really sorry!

106
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,900
What's wrong?

107
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,410
No worries, no one will find us here.

108
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,410
I can't believe I'm carrying on with
my best friend's stepson.

109
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,150
But this secretive,
kinky stuff really turns me on.

110
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,180
Where were you last night, Mitsuki?

111
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,460
I thought I was in bed with you.

112
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,390
Did you go down to the lake?

113
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,430
We'll talk about that later.

114
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,070
Hi Miyo.

115
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,570
What's going on?
This is the staff changing room.

116
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,710
Why, would I be in the way
of anything here?

117
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,840
Then, I hope you don't mind
if I change here.

118
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,850
I really need to change, so if you
don't mind, please leave, Takuya.

119
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,650
That's not convenient.

120
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,730
We were having an important
conversation right now.

121
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,390
Then, please go ahead.

122
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,380
Go ahead, I'll promise I won't be listen.

123
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,840
Will you excuse us?

124
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,280
Sure.

125
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,530
I am presuming that you have something
you want to tell me?

126
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,030
It's a disgrace to seduce Takuya
for your entertainment.

127
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,470
You're just out to corrupt him!

128
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,940
It's only been a year since Kodai died.

129
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:23,450
Takuya's still somewhat stand-offish
and won't call me mom.

130
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,450
No, I can't be getting depressed liked this!

131
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,550
Yes, I have so much to do!

132
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,690
What are you doing Takuya?

133
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,990
I was about to say the same thing.

134
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,030
What are you doing here at school?

135
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,660
I wanted to converse with Mitsuki today.

136
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,700
Yeah, Mitsuki's.

137
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,840
Something going on with Mitsuki?

138
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,070
No, nothing.

139
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,040
Are you sure?

140
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,180
You're not hiding something
from me, are you?

141
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,480
What makes you think that?

142
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,380
You're sure?

143
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,950
Sure.

144
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,990
If you say so.

145
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,660
I've been looking for you.

146
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,070
Mr. Toyotomi!

147
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,870
We're having problems.

148
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,440
We're back to our original plan.

149
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,930
The local group?

150
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,580
We need to go back to the headquarters.

151
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,470
Yes.

152
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,610
I'm going to be late tonight,
so don't wait for me for dinner.

153
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,120
Will you be okay?

154
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,520
Be careful.

155
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,180
I didn't mean to interrupt this morning.

156
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,810
Shit, there's nothing going on,
for god's sake.

157
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,050
You're embarrassed.

158
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,960
Wait, let me give you a word of advice
for all it's worth.

159
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:19,860
Remember that things happening right now,
as well as your past, is not absolute.

160
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,980
There are many outcomes to any situation,
and the reality will morph accordingly.

161
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,170
Situation?

162
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,310
Reality?

163
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,280
What are you talking about?

164
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,810
You'll eventually see what I'm talking about.

165
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,020
And my advice might prove to be
very useful, but just keep it in your head.

166
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,130
Just remember what I said.

167
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,600
Did I tell you that I called him last night?

168
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,310
So tell me what happened!

169
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,770
Miyo?

170
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,580
Come to pick another fight?

171
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,220
Come with me!

172
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,820
What, all of a sudden?

173
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,220
Just come with me!

174
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,960
Hey, slow down!

175
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,750
So Miyo, do you like Takuya or something?

176
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:53,560
Well, I don't think this situation
is healthy for anyone.

177
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,790
Well, I like him.

178
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,860
Well.

179
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,500
What?

180
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,170
Miss Mitsuki?

181
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,950
That was your first kiss?

182
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,610
Stop!

183
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:29,290
So, do you think you have something
to offer as a woman?

184
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,350
What?

185
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,630
I know there are lots of things I can do
to make him very happy.

186
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,060
So what's your point?

187
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,900
Remember that women love men
using their entire body.

188
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,040
You can't even tell him
how you feel...

189
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,110
much less do anything that could
possibly please him.

190
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,720
I can.

191
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,960
Hey, Takuya.

192
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,030
Hey, are you reading?

193
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,860
My dad had the very same book, too.

194
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,040
God, go put some clothes on!

195
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,310
Wait. Can you really read it?

196
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,220
I finally found it and bought it,
but I haven't been able to read it at all.

197
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,510
So how is it?

198
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,120
I can only read a bit.

199
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,290
Great. What does it say?

200
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,890
It says something about being
a path between the lake...

201
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,460
and the old well here.

202
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,160
Go on.

203
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,730
Will you get dressed?

204
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,230
Will you come to the well with me?

205
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,930
Why me?

206
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,010
I don't have much time left here.

207
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,080
So, what's your fascination with this?

208
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,150
I read one of the books your father wrote
about the lake...

209
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,810
and was really intrigued.

210
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,490
Yeah, about the old legend here...

211
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,320
something about the remains of an ancient,
advanced, culture.

212
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,770
I think it's great that the city I was born in
has such a great legend.

213
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,700
My father had strange ideas,
wrote some really kooky stuff.

214
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,910
That's not true...

215
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,770
he wasn't a kook.

216
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,210
He was your father.

217
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,380
So, are you going to listen to me?

218
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,050
Something about you traveling?

219
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,780
No, I'll be studying overseas!

220
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,430
Overseas, that's cool!

221
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,290
It was my father's decision.

222
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,460
I'll be leaving after this school break.

223
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,640
I thought before I leave.

224
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,930
Hey, is that the well?

225
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,900
Wait, let me finish first!

226
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,940
No rush, that's plenty of time.

227
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,040
Lots of time to make great memories.

228
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,620
Takuya.

229
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,990
What's it like down there?

230
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,530
Come on, tell me!

231
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,500
Well, this well is quite deep.

232
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,270
What's wrong?

233
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,740
What the hell is this?

234
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,970
Catch it, I'll throw it up there.

235
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,080
What is it?

236
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,790
It was stuck on the well wall here,
did you catch it?

237
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,130
Are you okay, Takuya?

238
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,400
What is going on?

239
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,460
Get back.

240
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,990
What is going on here?

241
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,470
What are you?

242
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,140
I'll be waiting for you, father.

243
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,550
Are my lectures really so boring?

244
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,130
No, absolutely.

245
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,760
I'm in the classroom?

246
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,250
Hey, wait up, Miyo.

247
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,420
What the hell do you want with me?

248
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,290
Don't ever talk to me!

249
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,440
This is all I can do.

250
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,410
This is all the data regarding that stone.

251
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,440
Where is it located?

252
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,310
This really is the best I can.

253
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,590
You will take me there?

254
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,030
What's up with Miyo's weird attitude today?

255
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,770
What did I do?

256
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,540
Takuya!

257
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,310
Ayumi, are you all right?

258
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:28,750
Nothing's wrong, but I really need
to get going right now. Bye!

259
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,750
I'm sorry I wasn't able to come back
home last night.

260
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,560
I couldn't leave work.

261
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,260
Don't worry about that.

262
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,670
Last night?

263
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:48,470
Wait a minute, you were at home
with Miyo the other night!

264
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,670
Me, with Miyo?

265
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,110
If you're dreaming about her why
don't you ask her out?

266
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,080
That was a dream?

267
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,060
Takuya!

268
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,490
Go home, stay out of trouble, and...

269
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,790
return this...

270
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,130
to Ayumi, please.

271
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,460
Wait. Those breasts.

272
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,490
You would only notice the breasts.

273
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,590
I already told you nothing's absolute.

274
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,130
You can't see the truth
unless you open your mind.

275
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,930
You must be Takuya, right?

276
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,620
Yeah, so?

277
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,730
I want you to forward a message
to your mother.

278
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,260
You mean Ayumi?

279
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,070
Tell her that further research is dangerous.

280
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,400
The "fire of life" is not for people
of this world.

281
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,150
Wait a minute, I don't know what
you're talking about.

282
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,440
Please, just tell her exactly what I said.

283
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,360
The rock should be returned
to its original location.

284
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,630
I need to get going now.

285
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,170
Hey, wait a minute!

286
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,930
Give her the message, please.

287
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,330
What is going on?

288
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,540
I'm getting more confused by the minute.

289
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,810
Want to know?

290
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,980
Do you want to know
what your mother's researching...

291
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,660
and hiding from the world?

292
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,490
Let me tell you a secret.

293
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,130
To be continued
