1
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:54,767
Romance is in the Flash of the Sword II

2
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:58,694
Episode 1:
What? The Demon Returns?

3
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:14,512
It's gone! The pendant my mother
gave me. My Silver Rainbow.

4
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,425
Not here. It's gone!

5
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:26,498
I must've lost it when...

6
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:38,035
How pretty. They look so delicious!

7
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:44,512
Lady Elfarcia, if you really want them,
please just ask me, your servant.

8
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,952
My lady.

9
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:48,518
That's not it, Gramps.

10
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:54,387
All I want is to be able to go
out like this sometimes.

11
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:59,823
Lady Elfarcia, you're the only heir
to the noble house of Arcline.

12
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:02,799
Your father doesn't want anything
to happen to you.

13
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:08,604
Am I a caged bird?

14
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,039
It's not...

15
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:11,642
Excuse me.

16
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,346
You okay, Gramps?

17
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:17,009
I'm fine.

18
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,815
But what a rough fellow!

19
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:24,990
Yes, that must've been it.
What should I do?

20
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:28,951
That pendant has been handed down
from my ancestors of Arcline.

21
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:33,195
I have an idea:

22
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,734
My mother used to tell me
that if one can spot a shooting star...

23
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,006
when the moon shines brightly,
an angel can make one's wish to come true.

24
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:49,205
Master came up with
a great invention once again.

25
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,051
This way, I can service
a lot larger area as an adventurer.

26
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:56,280
This is absolutely fantastic.

27
00:02:56,623 --> 00:03:00,821
But, the only types of jobs you get are
delivering things or searching for lost stuff.

28
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:06,855
I'm sure I'll get a good job
that suits me, soon enough.

29
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,198
Hey, don't lose control!

30
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,773
I can't believe your
father was the famous and honorable thief...

31
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:20,142
known throughout the Destragoon
Continent as Shadow Blade.

32
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:22,346
I can't take this!

33
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,072
You're killing me!

34
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,983
You stole this cigar from my client,
didn't you, you little bandit.

35
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:35,117
Are we thieves, or what?
You just want me to give it back.

36
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:38,524
You just want me to give
it back to them.

37
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:41,759
It's no use to you,
you who don't even know how to use it.

38
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,394
You're right-I can't appreciate it!
That's not the point!

39
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,339
What's this burning smell?

40
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:59,341
A shooting star! Dear Angel,
please let my wish to come true!

41
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:21,670
It's you, Mr. Angel.

42
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:24,109
Get off of me!

43
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:26,736
Who's the angel?

44
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,857
Mr. Angel, please hear my wish.

45
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:40,619
Please hear it.

46
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:49,033
My precious "Silver Rainbow" has been
stolen by someone. Please find it.

47
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:51,794
Can you help me? Please help.

48
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:53,166
Silver Rainbow?

49
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:56,140
Please find it and return it to me safely.

50
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:02,343
All right! I'll see that your wish comes true.

51
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,047
Lady Elfarcia!

52
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:10,745
Lady Elfarcia! I heard some
very loud noise just now.

53
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:13,116
Are you all right?

54
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:14,991
Gramps.

55
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,756
It was an angel!
And he heard my wish!

56
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:25,200
He's going to help me
find my silver rainbow pendant.

57
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:48,025
So, Silver Rainbow's a treasure
of historic value.

58
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:52,360
Master, do you know of a place
that specializes in stolen goods?

59
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:56,695
Curio dealers or some antique stores.
Anything like that at all?

60
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,505
Spika!

61
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,680
Sorry! Sorry!

62
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:12,980
Hey Spika, what's up with you?
Where you been?

63
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:15,453
What's up with Keith, do you know?

64
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:18,889
I don't know anything about him.

65
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:21,490
He's been acting weird since last night.

66
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:24,987
Wonder if he's found another woman.
Something like that.

67
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:29,991
Who knows. Do you think I'm
his supervisor or something.

68
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,032
Don't get so excited.

69
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:39,171
I like you. I can remember everything
until we fell out of that hang-glider.

70
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:43,605
I can't remember after that.

71
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:47,184
Everything that happened
to Keith, I mean.

72
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:51,422
Hey, you. What are you doing there?

73
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:02,867
Let me up.

74
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:06,505
Welcome!

75
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,086
Let me take your order.
What would you like?

76
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:32,257
An adventure. A job offer.

77
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,598
An adventure? Yes!

78
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:46,712
She's a reporter of ruins, is she?

79
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:51,015
She's to write about the Ruin
of the Glurd Palace.

80
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:54,609
I say, it's a beauty's encounter
with the mystery of an ancient ruin.

81
00:07:56,322 --> 00:08:01,726
This region is loaded with bandits.
I guess you're her bodyguard.

82
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:05,520
Are you grumbling?
With the reward and the thrill...

83
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:08,498
it's a perfect job for the adventurer Keith,
don't you think?

84
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,398
Would you rather sit around?

85
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:13,331
You probably have another reason,
don't you?

86
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:14,997
What do you mean?

87
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:19,709
I don't have any dirty thoughts
about my employer.

88
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:22,077
If that's what you're talking about.

89
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:24,748
Sorry to disturb your conversation.

90
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:30,749
This road. Isn't this a detour to the Ruin
of the Glurd Palace?

91
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:35,392
I hear that the area surrounding
the ruin is rather dangerous...

92
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:38,156
so I'm planning to hire an excellent guide.

93
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:39,897
A guide?

94
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:43,491
Master told me about this excellent
guide named Rycure, in the town of Gido.

95
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,746
Why do they think they can
take advantage of me, stupid hicks!

96
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:00,445
This isn't cheapo stuff.

97
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:03,351
They're not going to fool me. No way.

98
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,894
Vannessa!

99
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:14,956
Bagas.

100
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:22,137
What're you doing here?
You look really annoyed, Vanessa.

101
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:25,141
Frankly speaking, I am annoyed!

102
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,744
Don't say that.

103
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,639
Just let me be on it.

104
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:33,311
What're you talking about?

105
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:36,413
Don't hide it from me would you?

106
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,658
I have nothing to hide
from a sneaky thief like you.

107
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:46,154
I'm talking about that treasure.
You know the one that's getting all sweaty...

108
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:50,225
between the valley of your breasts.
Know what I'm talking about?

109
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:55,765
That's you?

110
00:09:56,342 --> 00:10:00,472
That's right. I'm Rycure,
an excellent guide to the ruins.

111
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:02,774
Got any problem?

112
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,649
None, no problems at all.

113
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:14,421
If you want to worry,
worry about that lady waiting outside.

114
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:19,528
There's a rough-looking rogue's advancing
on her, and won't leave her alone.

115
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:24,503
Help!

116
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:26,669
What's up?

117
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:30,300
He's actually manly. What a surprise!

118
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:32,142
Is that right?

119
00:10:32,478 --> 00:10:34,446
Hey, wait! I haven't
done anything to you yet.

120
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:35,538
Murderer!

121
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:56,224
As I expected.
That dagger is Shadow Blade.

122
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:01,100
He scared me.

123
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:07,335
Window repair will be charged along
with the guide fee, okay?

124
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,447
Didn't know it was your place.

125
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,552
- This way!
- Hang on tightly!

126
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,969
Why am I doing this?

127
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:06,667
Really, don't worry about it.
You know what?

128
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:10,402
Keith's got no problem
using people roughly.

129
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:13,540
Except that he's gentle with women.

130
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:18,543
How dare you!
Are you implying that I'm not a woman?

131
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:21,319
I didn't mean it that way.

132
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,489
Rycure, calm down. Don't worry about it.

133
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:28,755
I'm sure he's looking
for a delicious mushroom just for you.

134
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,568
How did this happen to us, Vanessa?

135
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:40,802
A man and a woman, traveling together.

136
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,771
It's a natural thing.

137
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,208
So, this dagger?

138
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:51,639
It's a memento of my dead father.

139
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:53,419
Is it?

140
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:02,559
So big.

141
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:08,156
Very well, let me have a good time.

142
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:12,700
I can't wait. Come on! Hurry!

143
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,032
That's good.
No, don't be rough.

144
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:28,119
Not there.

145
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,359
Don't tease me.

146
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:47,866
I'm coming. I'm coming!

147
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:51,071
Stronger! Harder!

148
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:32,874
The fluid of the descendant
of Shadow Blade.

149
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:45,163
With this, the seal will be broken.

150
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:57,741
Did I catch a little cold?

151
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:00,142
That's what happens when you sleep naked.

152
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:03,307
With ladies accompanying you,
how come you slept naked?

153
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:07,380
It was too hot to sleep.

154
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:11,714
Let's get going.

155
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:23,257
You're saying that woman
has the key to the treasure?

156
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:26,128
That's right.

157
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,603
We'll take both the treasure and the women.

158
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:33,477
Ready! Let's go!

159
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:39,274
It's getting hot. Aren't we there yet?

160
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,417
Once we pass over here, we're there.

161
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:45,256
Keith, you lack patience.

162
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:48,185
What's wrong, Rycure?

163
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:50,819
A danger is approaching.

164
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:52,488
A danger?

165
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:53,357
What's going on?

166
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:55,024
A danger is approaching?

167
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:56,725
Something will fall down.

168
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:00,572
Something'll fall down,
but, with this good weather?

169
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,275
What's that?

170
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:19,758
We're saved!

171
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,789
Can't believe rocks would fall.

172
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:29,995
Go hide!

173
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:45,550
Come on, Bandits! You'll learn the power
of Shadow Blade, the second generation!

174
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:59,130
It's really bad.
I was right about avoiding that fellow.

175
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:03,030
Anyhow, there's no way he'd win
against that mob.

176
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:16,912
Jannette!

177
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:24,683
Jannette's here to help us!

178
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,324
But, there's too many of them.

179
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:30,017
What's next?

180
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:34,959
What are you doing?

181
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:39,727
Be quiet. The power to you too.

182
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,844
Fireball!

183
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:13,097
This is the Ruins of the Glurd Palace.

184
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:16,202
Thanks. I'll start the research tomorrow.

185
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:20,568
Good! It's ready. Where's Jannette?

186
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,573
She said she wants to be alone.

187
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:24,546
Indeed, a lonely warrior.

188
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:33,752
Hey, it's me!

189
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:35,352
What do you want?

190
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,131
Have some! I'm not as good
as Master himself...

191
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,133
but as the branch manager,
I'm learning to cook, too.

192
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:47,563
Thanks for the help today.

193
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:50,571
So, could you find
what you're looking for at the battle?

194
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:53,475
I mean...

195
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,442
Who told you?

196
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:59,149
Master told me.
After being a mercenary for so long...

197
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,149
you don't see
the meaning in it anymore.

198
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,984
And that's why you're on the road.

199
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,550
That blabbermouth.

200
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:10,328
Aren't you going to eat?

201
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,899
I'm not hungry.
Would you like mine?

202
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:16,399
What? Really?

203
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:20,600
By the way, who's that woman?

204
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:30,847
I say, she's a tragic female warrior,
who can no longer find romance in battles.

205
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:31,972
Just leave me alone!

206
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:34,517
Suit yourself then!

207
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:38,512
What's wrong?

208
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:43,159
I said that she's a girl and she should
try not to risk her life so much.

209
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:45,955
Then she said that attacking
bandits was her hobby.

210
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:47,827
She didn't want to be lectured.

211
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:50,924
Let's eat!

212
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:57,170
She risked her life to save us,
not for a hobby.

213
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:25,436
They're finally asleep.
This is the right way to go.

214
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,769
Vannessa?

215
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:35,304
Thanks to the stew loaded
with the sleeping pill, they're fast asleep.

216
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:37,813
Now, no one can interfere.

217
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,914
The fluid of the descendent
of Shadow Blade is in this stone.

218
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:45,889
It shall break the curse
that seals the demon and free him!

219
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:50,691
What? It's not the treasure she's after.
She wants to resurrect the Demon Dune!

220
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:03,269
Did it need more fluid?
It wasn't enough?

221
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,336
I will draw his blood.

222
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:11,983
No! You're a poor little sad lad.

223
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:13,717
Hey! Found her.

224
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:16,245
She's right here. Fast asleep!

225
00:21:18,424 --> 00:21:20,722
They weren't all dead then.

226
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:24,321
She's a good looking woman, isn't she?

227
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:27,764
Instead of the treasure,
why don't we take her back?

228
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:32,760
The Chief will be excited!
Let's do that.

229
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,637
Yeah, let's. Here, pick her up.

230
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:37,574
She's heavy!

231
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:53,018
Demon Dune! Enjoy fully, the blood
of the descendant of Shadow Blade!

232
00:21:58,364 --> 00:21:59,661
What's up?

233
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:01,797
Nothing.

234
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:03,464
This place...

235
00:22:04,703 --> 00:22:08,195
I'm too excited to sleep
with the ruin and all. Shall we...

236
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:10,808
you know, do it?

237
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:29,155
The time has come to break
the seal that binds...

238
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:32,024
Demon Dune and for me to usurp his power!

239
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:45,566
As a reward for leading me here...

240
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:48,772
I'll allow you the honor
of seeing how I will unite...

241
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:52,373
with the Demon Dune!
And you shall die.

242
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:20,810
Rycure!

243
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:29,685
Are you the reincarnation
of the Palace Witch?

244
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:31,211
Take this!

245
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:38,989
With the power of the light and the air,
I shall seal you again...

246
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:41,498
to where you belong, Demon of darkness!

247
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,021
Rycure!

248
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:10,356
Did anything happen?

249
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:12,588
Rycure! You okay?

250
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:17,199
I'm too full to eat any more.

251
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:20,667
No! I've done nothing!

252
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:23,765
It's the bandits
who took that female warrior!

253
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:28,636
Jannette's kidnapped?
Where's their stronghold?

254
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:31,509
You assholes! You bastards!

255
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:33,442
Let me go!

256
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:39,088
This one's a good one.

257
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:44,384
Let me get my satisfaction
I couldn't get from the treasure.

258
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,139
Stop it!

259
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:59,174
No!

260
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:01,276
No, don't!

261
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:03,573
Stop it!

262
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:06,684
Well, you pretend you don't like it,
but your nipples don't lie.

263
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:11,915
What about this? Like this one?

264
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:19,594
You're getting really wet.

265
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:23,492
Don't! Stop!

266
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:28,603
Once this special lotion is applied,
you'd be the one crying for more.

267
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:31,572
Now, how's it?

268
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:34,904
Please don't!

269
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:43,384
Well, it's about time now.

270
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,982
The way she moves gets me horny.

271
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:03,365
Jannette! I'm here to take you back!

272
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:04,531
Keith!

273
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:07,772
Get him!

274
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,977
He's using our weapon against us!

275
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:29,195
What's wrong, Jannette? You okay?

276
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:35,571
Please, Keith. My body's so aroused.
I can't bear it. Please, I want you!

277
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:37,038
I want you.

278
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:50,349
Be gentle.

279
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:55,184
No.

280
00:26:57,896 --> 00:26:59,386
Don't stop.

281
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:02,356
Please don't hurt me.

282
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:05,733
I'm going crazy.

283
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,940
No, don't.

284
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,171
No. You're breaking me apart.

285
00:27:30,095 --> 00:27:32,029
More! Harder!

286
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:42,034
Here, the next one.

287
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:44,500
So, what shall I cook next?

288
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:49,981
How is it, Master? Is it yummy?

289
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:57,377
But of course! Nope, none of that.
Too bad, but I guess...

290
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:59,150
I can't cook for Keith.

291
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,323
Where's he anyway?

292
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,984
Since I saw him last.

293
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:05,461
There's been no messages
from Mr. Angel.

294
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:13,995
Elfarcia, I'll find your Silver Rainbow.

295
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:20,473
What? What an enormous dog!

296
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:32,153
Beauty.
