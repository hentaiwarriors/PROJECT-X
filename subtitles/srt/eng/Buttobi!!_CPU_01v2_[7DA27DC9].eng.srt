1
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,580
I got it!

2
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,280
I finally got it!

3
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,180
My own computer!
I finally bought it!

4
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,990
What the hell is this?!

5
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,310
Forgive me I keep you riding
on uneasy feelings all the time

6
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,350
Cause I wanna know
everything about you

7
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,450
My heart starts to
drive itself uncontrollably

8
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,920
And I can't help
feeling great joy

9
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,590
More nervous than before
because I can't tell you

10
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,660
I have a desire to love
you more and more

11
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,700
But this emptiness is
the other side of love

12
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,530
Only if you take us
to a higher level

13
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,230
Your hot access

14
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,240
Is what I am really waiting for

15
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,510
Most likely I will get
you in more trouble

16
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,610
But please accept my wholeness

17
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,750
With my heart kept innocent
like I'm bare naked before you

18
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,690
As I stand close to you

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,330
Your hot access

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,570
Is what I'm longing for

21
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:09,270
Extreme Access

22
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,580
I... I've been tricked.

23
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,710
Three years of earning
money from part-time jobs...

24
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,020
have bought me a vinyl sex doll!

25
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,140
It... it moved.

26
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,700
Thank you very much for
purchasing this product.

27
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,340
I... it's talking.

28
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,270
I am an NBC personal
computer PC 2198 AX.

29
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,940
2198?

30
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,480
Did you just say 2198?

31
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,850
Th... that shouldn't be right.

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,260
But... the writing on the box said 9821.

33
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,030
You're mistaken, Master.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,060
Master?

35
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,030
You read it this way.

36
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:07,970
See?

37
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,930
Oh, now I see.

38
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,240
This isn't funny!
I want to return it right now!!

39
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,610
Unfortunately, you already
filed your user registration.

40
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,510
What?

41
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,050
I will execute the owner's
utility program now.

42
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,280
Please begin the system format.

43
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,450
System format?

44
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,490
What are you talking about?
You're just a vinyl sex doll?

45
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,260
Master, you don't seem
to have a lot of knowledge...

46
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,460
about bio-type computers like myself.

47
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,290
Then I don't have much choice.

48
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,170
I will change the program to level 1.

49
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,470
L... Level 1?

50
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,840
That means the lowest?

51
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:54,580
I have to force you to input
your data to format the system.

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,840
W... wait!

53
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,240
Keep away!

54
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,390
Ah... wait! Hey!

55
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,090
S... stop!

56
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,820
Stop!!

57
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,730
H... hey!

58
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,200
What are you doing?

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,730
W... wait a minute.

60
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,300
A whole PC9821 set
isjust 98,000 yen?

61
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,400
I'll get it! I'll definitely get it!

62
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,650
It's at Animal Electric in Akihabara.

63
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,940
Third floor of the PC building.

64
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,510
Thank you Junpei! Futoshi!

65
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,750
Friends are always helpful.

66
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,050
Aren't they?

67
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,150
Well, if I can get it I can be.

68
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,780
But, Takaoka...

69
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,560
What?

70
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,720
Look at the top of the flyer.

71
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,560
What?

72
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,930
For the first five customers only!

73
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,300
I'm sure there are people who've
waited in line from the night before.

74
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,960
The store opens at 10 AM.

75
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,600
What are you going
to do about school?

76
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,870
Well, I'll cut class and go.

77
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,500
Do you have enough money?

78
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,480
I worked hard part-time for
three years and saved 110,000 yen.

79
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,640
Besides, I'm the only person in the
Electric Brain Study Society...

80
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,180
that doesn't have his own computer.

81
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,750
I can't pass up this chance.

82
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,760
Takaoka.

83
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,860
What's everybody discussing?
You guys all look excited.

84
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,130
What's up Shimada?

85
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,760
Akira is finally buying a computer.

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,770
You guys are talking
about computers again?

87
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,500
Doesn't anybody
get bored of it?

88
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,340
Shut up! You don't even know
how to use a computer...

89
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,270
so don't tell us what to do!

90
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,680
Who cares!

91
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,580
I know you're only playing
X-Rated games on it.

92
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,580
Foolish girl!

93
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,520
We got bored of those kind of
games a long time ago!

94
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,980
Asshole.

95
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,190
Akira, are you buying a computer
to play those kind of games, too?

96
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,520
Don't even think that
I'm like Junpei.

97
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,690
Then why?

98
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,100
I'm going to deal with the world.

99
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,290
The world?

100
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,330
Yes!

101
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,440
I want to have access all
over the world via the Internet.

102
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,870
Akira, you are so cool!

103
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,300
What's so cool about it?

104
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,310
I must own a computer to do that.

105
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

106
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,710
My hand slipped.

107
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,450
Well, we always give you
a 30 to 40% discount.

108
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,550
Nobody can beat our prices
here at Animal Electric.

109
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,160
The PC 9821 printed on the ad?

110
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,060
Sorry, it sold out in five minutes.

111
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,330
What?!

112
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,070
The cheapest one in all
the other places is 210,000.

113
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,940
I can't buy it unless I
work for another three years.

114
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,740
Hey... boy.

115
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,820
M... me?

116
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,450
Yes...

117
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,080
You came here to buy
a computer, didn't you?

118
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,990
Yeah.

119
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,560
But the one I wanted to buy
was sold out in five minutes.

120
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,030
I think they made that ad
just to bring in customers.

121
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
I'm sorry to hear that.

122
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,400
Well then, take a look at this.

123
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,200
9821?

124
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,970
How much is that
store selling this for?

125
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,410
N... ninety eight thousand yen.

126
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,940
I see... I can sell you this
one at the same price.

127
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,950
What?!

128
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,720
B... but isn't that used?

129
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,190
You must be kidding.
This is brand new.

130
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:33,370
This is a bankruptcy liquidated
product from a home electronics store.

131
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,870
W... what are the specs?

132
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,830
64 MB memory. A Pentacle 481 CPU.

133
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,070
Are you sure the price is 98,000 yen?

134
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,280
It comes with the
manufacturer's warranty.

135
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,180
I... I'll take it!

136
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,550
You got it!

137
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,250
But once you've open the package,
you can't return it.

138
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,960
As soon as you see what's inside,
it automatically registers the user.

139
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,090
And we don't deliver.

140
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,760
Sorry, but you'll have
to carry it with you.

141
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,280
Forced input completed.

142
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,490
It's so sad to end
my boyhood life like this.

143
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,720
Next, I will write the
data into a file.

144
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,490
Y... you, what do you...?

145
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,660
Oh?!

146
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,490
Owner format completed.

147
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,060
Reset and restart the computer.

148
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,310
Is it broken?

149
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,950
I... it's warm and soft.

150
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,980
Just like a human.

151
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,460
No!

152
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,160
This is... I...

153
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,030
System has restarted.

154
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,090
I will read your data.

155
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,930
Name: Akira Takaoka,
21 years old, Blood type A RH+...

156
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,940
Height 170 cm, Weight 56 kg.

157
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,010
Student of Hakusen Gakuen college.

158
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,040
You have 2 parents and a sister.

159
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,340
Your parents are living in
London for their business.

160
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,250
Your sister is abroad as a
member of a volunteer group.

161
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,650
W... wait a minute.

162
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,920
I never told you
any of those things.

163
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,130
I got it from reading your
active molecule.

164
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,060
My active molecule?

165
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,530
You mean?!

166
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,290
It was very good.

167
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, really?

168
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,840
I don't care about that!

169
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,100
What right do you
have to investigate me?

170
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,540
B... but...

171
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,840
I will tell you if you don't know.

172
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,710
It's called "invasion of privacy".

173
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,010
I understand.

174
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,410
Then let's use another parameter.

175
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,350
Enough!

176
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,220
Yes.

177
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,150
Master.

178
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,390
Please order me to do something.

179
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,390
Please.

180
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,960
Order me... to do something.

181
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,540
Master.

182
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,330
Master.

183
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,580
I'll wait for your command.

184
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,070
Forever.

185
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,560
It's my sister's.
Please put it on.

186
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,740
It's difficult for me to talk,
if you are naked.

187
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,770
Yes.

188
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,000
Master.

189
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,240
How do I look?

190
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,110
Oh... I guess it's your size.

191
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,210
It looks good on you.

192
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,780
I'm glad to hear that.

193
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,190
Master.

194
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,120
Here.

195
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,550
What's this?

196
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,530
This is my protect ring
to prevent other people...

197
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,770
from writing their
personal data on me.

198
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,300
It's proof that I serve you.

199
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,240
I see.

200
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,990
A protect ring for write protection.

201
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,580
How do you use this?

202
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,650
Put it on my...

203
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,660
...left ring finger.

204
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,660
What?

205
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,630
Wow!

206
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,000
This is somewhat like a wedding.

207
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:15,180
Now l, NBC PC2198AX,
product name Pixie...

208
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,510
am set to serve you.

209
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,210
Pixie?

210
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,890
I remember that means small fairy.

211
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,390
Use me however you'd
like on a regular basis.

212
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,860
I'm here to serve you.

213
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,940
Well, Master, you can give
me any command you want.

214
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,170
A... any command?

215
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,080
I will connect to my modem.

216
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,550
No, it's all right! Hello.

217
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,190
Hey, Akira?

218
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,320
What's "alright"?

219
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,160
Oh, nothing.

220
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,060
What's wrong?

221
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,290
Are you excited because
you bought a computer?

222
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,730
Y... yeah, I bought it but...

223
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,240
Great!

224
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,170
Then Futoshi and I will bring over a
bunch of software for you right now!

225
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,170
I'm looking forward to seeing it!

226
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,420
Is something wrong?

227
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,780
My friends are coming
to see me now.

228
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,820
Then let me prepare
to serve them.

229
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,720
What's wrong?

230
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,920
Warning!

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,400
A same model computer signal
is interfering in this area!

232
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,490
Friendly access is being rejected.

233
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,060
Parity check is being ignored.

234
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,130
I've found many bugs in
this opponent's utilities.

235
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,930
Warning.

236
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,940
Opponent model...

237
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,940
while ignoring my instructions,
is running an attack application

238
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,140
What are we going to do, Master?

239
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,140
But there's just a girl walking.

240
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,810
I don't see any dangerous...

241
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,450
Master!

242
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,590
Watch out!!

243
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,570
She attacked us!

244
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,300
W... whatjust happened?

245
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,770
Master, should I fire a
counter-attack against her?

246
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,940
Counter-attack?
How can we do that?

247
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,510
What's this?

248
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,350
These are application cards
for the 2198 series, like me.

249
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,720
What? This is software?

250
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,520
Blue card is for life.
Yellow is for emergency.

251
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,150
Red is for attack.

252
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,260
We can expand our areas of
operation by using these cards.

253
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,060
Opponent machine
has invaded the perimeter!!

254
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,290
Give me the order for counter attack!

255
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,330
Then, I will pick this!

256
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,730
Red number three!

257
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,060
Beam attack!

258
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,410
W... why are you taking
off your underwear?

259
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,680
Please insert the application
card into the front slot drive.

260
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,950
Slot?

261
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,150
T... there?

262
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,680
Master! Please hurry!

263
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,560
Alright, alright.

264
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,560
Oh yes!

265
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,330
Y... you don't have to moan like that.

266
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,700
S... she's here!

267
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,600
Begin loading data!

268
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,250
Start up beam attack!!

269
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,140
What's wrong?

270
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,280
I can't start.

271
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,340
What?!

272
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,980
Oh shit!

273
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,850
W... why can't you start?

274
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,420
I need an upgrade.

275
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,860
You don't have enough memory?!

276
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,200
Damn it.

277
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,130
It's because of my damn father...

278
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,190
This room and the toilet are
the only places I can lock.

279
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,570
He said something stupid, like...

280
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,300
"families should never
keep any secrets".

281
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,870
Master, please give
me 1500 gigabytes memory.

282
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,240
1500 gigabytes?

283
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,110
Do you know how much that costs?!

284
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,080
Hey stop.

285
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,750
Don't get undressed just
because we're in the bathroom.

286
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,720
But we can't start the application
if we don't expand the memory.

287
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,790
Please give me memory, Master.

288
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,290
There's no computer
shops open at this time.

289
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,020
The only way to
increase my memory...

290
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,800
is to install more of your active
molecules into my front slot.

291
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,260
What?!!

292
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,540
Please, Master!

293
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,940
M... my active molecule?

294
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,740
I... install into your...

295
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,370
f... front slot?

296
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,050
Master...

297
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,880
hurry up.

298
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,480
Install them into me.

299
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,190
B... but...

300
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,390
I...

301
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,500
I!!

302
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,960
Please.

303
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,930
Master.

304
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,730
Please.

305
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,240
I... I'll make a directory for
the newly installed memory.

306
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,620
Give me a name...

307
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,550
Mimi!!

308
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,390
Mimi... is it?

309
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,350
M... my name is Mimi.

310
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,700
Make a directory.
File name: Mimi.

311
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,040
Oh... memory is expanding.
200, 500, 700.

312
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,980
Memory expanded!

313
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,610
Current status is 1600 gigabytes.

314
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,320
OK!

315
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,290
Application: Beam attack!

316
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,670
She doesn't have a ring.

317
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,320
Is she dead?

318
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,960
No, just her higher
functions have stopped.

319
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,060
But why did she attack us?

320
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,590
Her protect ring was taken off...

321
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,830
and several people have
overwritten data on her.

322
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,100
That's why she locked up.

323
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,870
Yes.

324
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,240
Is he your...

325
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,950
Master?

326
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,980
He must be treating
you very nice.

327
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,520
I envy you.

328
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,090
My...

329
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,360
My Master is...

330
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,870
My...

331
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,890
No.

332
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I can't remember anything.

333
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,100
I'm... sorry to bother you... but...
please make me disappear.

334
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,110
I understand.

335
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,480
I will execute an extinction command.

336
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,620
Serial number 868091
NBC PC 2198 AE.

337
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,530
2198?

338
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,630
She's the same as Mimi.

339
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,320
Do you want to continue with
the extinction command?

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,030
Yes.

341
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,100
Executing command.

342
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,310
Thank you.

343
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,190
Mimi.

344
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,800
We can't choose masters.

345
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,200
We are computers.

346
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,870
We are products sent
from a factory.

347
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,500
She had...

348
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,440
bad luck.

349
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,380
Mimi.

350
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,710
Oh shit!

351
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,070
My friends are coming here soon!

352
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,450
Oh, don't worry about it.

353
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,210
What?

354
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,790
Please insert yellow R4.

355
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,650
What?! Install memory again?

356
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,030
No, I have enough memory for now.

357
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,940
Data load completed.

358
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,330
Yellow R4.

359
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,670
Restoration version 3.0.

360
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,030
Execute.

361
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,180
Wow, you're heavy!

362
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,220
Futoshi, you should lose more weight.

363
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,690
Junpei! Look in front of you.

364
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,490
What?

365
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,570
Oh no, the handle is bent.

366
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,840
Junpei.

367
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,880
What?

368
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,210
Just now, I saw Akira's
broken house fix itself.

369
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,380
What?

370
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,920
Futoshi, did you just bang your head?

371
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,290
No.

372
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,120
Just my ass.

373
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,620
Master, everything is back to normal.

374
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,340
Wow, how did you just do that?

375
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,600
Oh no, they're here.

376
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,600
Then I must welcome them.

377
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,100
You stay right here, OK.

378
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,780
Hello, Akira.

379
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,510
Good evening, Takaoka.

380
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,450
I brought lots of software,
just like I said.

381
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,850
Oh... but right now...
I'm kind of busy.

382
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,120
What?

383
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,720
Is something wrong
with your new computer?

384
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,090
Then I can...

385
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,290
No! Not now!

386
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,060
It's really bad right now.

387
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,960
Sorry, see you at school, goodnight!

388
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,870
Hey, Akira!?

389
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,400
He's weird.

390
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,240
I sent them home.

391
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,740
Was it all right?

392
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,920
I have no idea how to
introduce you to them.

393
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,110
From this day on, I am Mimi.

394
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,280
I got a great name from you.

395
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,320
And...

396
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,660
I'm all yours forever and always.

397
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,090
All mine?

398
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,330
Yes, Master.

399
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,210
Oh yeah, Mimi, you said you were
waiting for a command, didn't you?

400
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,270
Yes.

401
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,850
Please order me to do anything.

402
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,270
That's it.

403
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,280
I would rather be called
by my name, than master.

404
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,850
Yes, I understand.
Akira.

405
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,450
A... kira?

406
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,700
A... kira... A... kira, oh no.

407
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,830
A... kira... A... kira.

408
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,900
It's difficult to say your name.

409
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,070
Maybe Akira got an
extremely dirty game.

410
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,870
He might be trying to enjoy it
all by himself, so he sent us away.

411
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,850
Akira, Akira.

412
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,410
Mimi... that's enough.

413
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,650
Akira!

414
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,350
I said it!

415
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,120
I did it! I did it!

416
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,190
I said it Master!

417
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,000
What's the matter, Futoshi?

418
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,100
Oh... nothing.

419
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,230
Let's go.

420
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah.

421
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,470
Type is small for each other

422
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,610
Although we hurt each other

423
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,470
In the name of fate
we are destined to be together

424
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,280
My heart still believes
more than ever

425
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,220
Ending never
expanding memory forever

426
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,850
Dreaming of that kind of love

427
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,590
Since I feel so sure
of your faith in me

428
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,600
No matter how much the
program takes over my heart

429
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,370
Your hot access

430
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,000
I feel more love from you

431
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,330
Most likely I will get
you into more trouble

432
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,530
But please accept my wholeness

433
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,430
With my heart kept innocent
like I'm bare naked in front of you

434
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,100
As I stand close to you

435
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,010
Your hot access

436
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,180
I am longing for

437
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,160
I am a personal computer, Mimi.

438
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,030
I was so lucky to be picked
up by a wonderful master, Akira.

439
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,430
But, he lied about me.

440
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,990
Saying that I'm a relative
from overseas, to everyone.

441
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,230
So I had to hustle
to keep up with all those lies.

442
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,900
But you'll have to wait to enjoy
those details in the next episode.

443
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,580
Buttobi CPU, Episode 2.
"Hang Up Gently"

444
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,050
I will memory up with you tonight.
