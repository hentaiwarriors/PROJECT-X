1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,336
What is this? This is unbelievable!

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,641
This is terrible...

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,304
This is terrible!

4
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:23,485
No!

5
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,895
This village is cursed!
It's poisoned by a devil!

6
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,600
The witch must be hiding
somewhere in this village.

7
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,465
Hawks! Check these ladies' bodies carefully.

8
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,597
You must find the witches!

9
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,984
T- There must be some mistake. I'm not...

10
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,888
I'm not a witch!

11
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,659
Ohh, you say you're not a witch?

12
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:08,660
Hey!

13
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:09,493
Yes sir.

14
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,405
Don't you realize you have a
witch's poison all over your body?

15
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:20,272
So you should understand that I am
purifying your body with my sperm.

16
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,574
There!

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,549
Suck it, otherwise the holy
water won't come out of me.

18
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,488
I'm coming. I'll purify you now...

19
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:45,726
Who are you?!

20
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:53,669
What a terrible and sad destiny
she carries on her shoulders!

21
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,940
I'm telling you this for your own good.
Just forget about that baby.

22
00:01:58,718 --> 00:01:59,776
What do you mean by that?

23
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:04,124
If you get involved in her terrible destiny,

24
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,558
all will fall to ruin.

25
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,653
Count Calvin, I understand how you feel, but...

26
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,589
No, I will raise this baby.

27
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,893
Count Calvin?!

28
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:19,631
Count Nicklal, please let me keep this baby.

29
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,908
I found her outside of my mansion
the day my pregnant wife died.

30
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:27,870
I can't help but think that this baby
is supposed to be my wife's baby.

31
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,282
No matter how terrible her destiny is,

32
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,317
I will keep this baby as
a child of the Calvin family.

33
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,887
Count Pickingel! What is all this commotion?!

34
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,017
What do you mean by commotion?

35
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,986
We were sent to this town
to subdue the witches...

36
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,498
...that have been poisoning the villagers.

37
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,837
I have the King's direct authority
to burn down the village...

38
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,964
...as a warning to others.

39
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,708
Y- You bastard!

40
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,479
What's wrong Count Pickingel?
You have a problem?

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,723
I, Mayatola Calvin, the commanding
officer of the First Imperial guard...

42
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,281
...am not going anywhere!

43
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:21,864
IMMA YOUJO

44
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,921
It's Commander Mayatola!

45
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,646
He's so handsome!

46
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,785
Ohh... Commander Mayatola!
Ohh... Commander Mayatola!

47
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,789
The Witch Purification Force has returned!

48
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,287
I heard they burned everything down.

49
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,164
Die!

50
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,399
Die!

51
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:10,646
Enter.

52
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:19,249
Regimental commander of the First
Imperial Guard, Mayatola Calvin,

53
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,457
returning from the inspection of the
witch purification of Donuve village.

54
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,791
Thank you for your help.

55
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,369
I'm the one who was supposed to go there,

56
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:31,098
but I'm too old for field work.

57
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,228
Don't say that.

58
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,000
You are still young, General.

59
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,175
Don't flatter me.

60
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,310
I crossed swords with your father,

61
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:43,611
and spent nights drinking
with him a long time ago.

62
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,948
How is your father?

63
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:47,513
He's not doing well.

64
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,451
He grows weaker every day.

65
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,016
I see.

66
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,393
Well, if it isn't Count Mayatola...

67
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,803
Did you already make
your report to the General?

68
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,668
You're really devoted to your work.

69
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,038
Count Pickingel!

70
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,209
It pained me to give that report!

71
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,744
He burned down the village before
even conducting an official trial.

72
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,450
He stabbed and killed men
who tried to run away.

73
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:28,185
And in front of their corpses,
he forced women to...

74
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,023
How long should Count Pickingel's
witch-hunt continue?

75
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,595
I just can't let it continue any more!

76
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,684
You don't have to say another word.

77
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:40,335
I've heard so many things about him.

78
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,510
But he's had tremendous results
with the witch-hunts so far...

79
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,070
...and he is the King's favorite.

80
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:51,784
And the King sent Isabel to
supervise the witch-hunt.

81
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,581
This also helps Count Pickingel.

82
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,583
As long as Isabel is with him,
I can't interfere so easily,

83
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,415
because her word is considered
to be the King's word.

84
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,589
I know that Count Pickingel's
arrogance has grown,

85
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,764
so I started worrying about you.

86
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,194
Me? What about me?

87
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,732
Don't you realize?

88
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,242
After I die, he will never be able
to get the General's position...

89
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,677
...unless you die or lose your position.

90
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,146
I'm not worried about myself
because I'm old anyway.

91
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,078
But I don't want you to
be in a dangerous situation.

92
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,888
You have a secret that may put
you in a difficult situation.

93
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:33,689
Look, be careful of Count Pickingel!

94
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,355
Never let him find out your secret!

95
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:49,536
Are you planning to have a fair
trial for the girls you captured,

96
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,443
Count Pickingel?

97
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,569
Of course.

98
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:57,981
The King has put me in charge of
the witch-hunt, Count Mayatola.

99
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,682
The way you were in Donuve village...

100
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,481
...was far from being fair.

101
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:08,221
I was just following the King's orders.

102
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,666
What's wrong, Count Pickingel?

103
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,439
Aren't you satisfied after
catching so many witches?

104
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,445
I'm... not a witch...

105
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,644
It doesn't matter whether
or not you're a witch...

106
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:14,519
Your destiny was already set
once you came to this castle.

107
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,870
You will never get out of here alive.

108
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:31,105
But if you want to live longer,
you'll have to work hard.

109
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,873
Hey, what are you doing?

110
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,577
Brand the witch's emblem on
their skin before they escape.

111
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,155
Even if they escape,

112
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,715
they will be caught and
executed as a witch, anyway.

113
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,058
Did you find out anything?

114
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,833
I'm sure we will be hearing good news soon.

115
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,997
I'm looking forward to that.

116
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,172
Here!

117
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,649
Oh, is that you, Maya?
When did you come back?

118
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,589
I'm sorry. Did I wake you, Father?

119
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,265
I can't always be asleep...

120
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,995
...since you're working hard
all through the night.

121
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:04,600
Father!

122
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,605
Are you all right? Father.

123
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,933
I hated the disease that took your
mother, with my heart and soul.

124
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,174
But I hated it too much, and now
the disease has come back to haunt me.

125
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,810
No it hasn't, Father...

126
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:42,830
Who's there?!

127
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,679
I- I'm sorry! I was here to
tell you the bath is ready.

128
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:49,880
But you were sleeping very comfortably.

129
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,952
I thought you shouldn't
catch a cold, and... and...

130
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,687
Ahh! I don't know what I was trying to say!

131
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:55,619
I'm sorry...

132
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,454
You don't have to apologize, Anne.

133
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,730
I appreciate you taking care
of my father while I'm not at home.

134
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,896
Please don't say that... I just...

135
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,392
I appreciate you very much, Anne.

136
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,530
Please keep up the good work.

137
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:14,362
Yes!

138
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,640
Be quiet.

139
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,105
Father will wake up.

140
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:22,709
All right?

141
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,547
Well, then let's go.

142
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,096
It's a nice smell.

143
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,030
I will leave your clean clothes here.

144
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,368
Um, shall I scrub your back?

145
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,471
Huh? Did you say something, Anne?

146
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,007
N- No...

147
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,243
I'm all right here by myself.

148
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,577
Why don't you go to bed now.

149
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,947
Yes. Then...

150
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,534
The more you try to fight against destiny,

151
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,736
the more the vortex of
the destiny will speed up.

152
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,797
It will swallow up everything
and crumble it into dust.

153
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,339
But there is a way to get away from it.

154
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,636
What? Is that true?

155
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:33,241
A new path may open up if you
bind another string on her destiny.

156
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,679
But it's very cruel for her.

157
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,091
You shouldn't let men get close to her.

158
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,860
She should abandon being a woman,
and live as a man.

159
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,802
You shouldn't let anybody
know she is a woman...

160
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:53,033
...and bind her destiny with new string.

161
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,793
If the string is cut, the
original destiny will return...

162
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:01,747
...and it'll become a great vortex,
swallowing everything.

163
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:05,410
Do you understand? You cannot
let her destiny awaken.

164
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,949
Count Mayatola...

165
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,030
Oh, Count Mayatola! I'm... I'm...

166
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,541
<i>Maya boy, come on. Let's fight.</i>

167
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,349
It didn't feel bad to live as a man, back then.

168
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,288
I don't remember when we met.

169
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,558
We naturally became friends.

170
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:20,856
We had fun together...

171
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,120
Got angry together...

172
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,125
Felt sad together...

173
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,030
We drank all night and talked together.

174
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,535
It was the happiest time of my life.

175
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,704
Until that day...

176
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:52,086
I wish that I were a real man.

177
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:57,694
I cursed my fate that I had
to hide being a woman.

178
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,285
Ah... wind?

179
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,710
After using impartial justice,

180
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,416
these people, who we captured at
the witch-hunt in Donuve village...

181
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,577
...have been proven to be witches.

182
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,245
If we let them live, it will
certainly bring disaster to our city.

183
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:01,453
Therefore, by the king's authority,
we sentence them...

184
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,389
...to burn at the stake.

185
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,005
Count Pickingel!

186
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,046
Start the fire!

187
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:21,512
Yes sir!

188
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,489
This is cruel. This is too merciless!

189
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,672
Count Pickingel, you must
explain this all to me.

190
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,544
I don't know what you are talking about.

191
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,686
Don't play dumb!

192
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,355
Explain the punishment you just did.

193
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,656
If you really did a fair trial...

194
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,817
...how come those women had bruises
and cuts on their bodies?

195
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,890
I guess you don't know anything.

196
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:16,525
The King ordered us to punish the
witches in the cruelest way possible.

197
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,795
Since you want me to be against the
King's word, that means you are...

198
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,863
...a traitor!

199
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,747
Now you dare raise your sword
to me, using the King's name!

200
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,647
You are the lowest clod that I know.

201
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,819
You must have forced these
girls to confess under torture...

202
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:37,277
...and burned them to erase the evidence!

203
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,754
You bastard!

204
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,330
I don't have any evidence right now,

205
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,273
but I will find the proof and expose you.

206
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,341
Do you understand?

207
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,979
What is wrong with you?

208
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,792
I can't take it if you're too rough!

209
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,130
Oh no! Not there!

210
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,026
Damn you, Mayatola!

211
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,365
No!

212
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,004
Your wound has opened up again.

213
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,775
The wound Count Mayatola gave you.

214
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,754
I wasn't fighting him seriously.

215
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,626
But today is the last day for Mayatola.

216
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,356
What?

217
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,964
Clory has found out an
unbelievable secret about him.

218
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,939
And now, he must be finishing up the job.

219
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,084
The wind?

220
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:03,934
Go!

221
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:04,526
Yes sir.

222
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:11,906
What is going on?!

223
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,541
What do you think you are doing?

224
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,314
Do you know who I am?

225
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,146
We know who you are Count Mayatola.

226
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,753
We came here because we received an order.

227
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,511
Whose order?

228
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,118
S- Sir, we have a problem!

229
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,220
C... Count Calvin is... Count Calvin is...

230
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,739
Count Mayatola, we are
placing you are under arrest...

231
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,230
...for the murder of Count Calvin.

232
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,408
Oh no, it can't be.

233
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,310
F- Father...

234
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,046
Count Mayatola!

235
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,056
Hey! Stop right there!

236
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,649
What are you doing?
Get away from him!

237
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,222
Don't worry Anne. I'll be back soon.

238
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,097
Please take care of the mansion until then.

239
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,559
C- Count Mayatola.

240
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,298
By the way Anne, my father...

241
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,970
Count Mayatola!

242
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,541
Count Mayatola!

243
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,935
Count Mayatola!

244
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,439
Count Mayatola!

245
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,996
Hey, isn't that Count Calvin's son, Mayatola?

246
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,097
It can't be.

247
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,773
Why is Count Mayatola tied up?

248
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,355
Count Mayatola... I have been waiting for you.

249
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:05,791
Pickingel, why are you here?!
Count Mayatola... I have been waiting for you.

250
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,055
Pickingel, why are you here?!

251
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,191
I'm here to arrest you.

252
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,287
Listen everybody!

253
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,729
Count Mayatola is a murderer,
who killed his own father.

254
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:21,494
Not only that, he is a witch
who tries to manipulate people!

255
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,040
A witch?

256
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,009
Count Mayatola is a witch?

257
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,874
I'm a man! I'm not a witch!

258
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,413
You can't hide it anymore.

259
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:33,043
I know the truth. You are really a woman.

260
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,549
You hid your real identity,
because you were scared...

261
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:37,981
...that people would find out
that you are a witch.

262
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,320
What kind of proof do
you have to say such lies!

263
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,427
Are you out of your mind, Count Pickingel?

264
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:45,362
You can't say that anymore.

265
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,654
And now!

266
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,265
Ah! Stop it!

267
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,059
Here is...

268
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,268
...the evidence!

269
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,485
You are charged with being a witch.

270
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,723
No! Count Mayatola can't be a witch!

271
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,326
No way! This is not true!

272
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,028
Count Calvin was already
dead when I found him.

273
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,708
I discovered that Commander
Mayatola's blade...

274
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,437
...was used as the murder weapon.

275
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,410
While I was taking him into custody,

276
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:37,381
Count Pickingel came and exposed
Mayatola as a woman and a witch...

277
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,809
...then he took her away.

278
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,018
I see. You are dismissed.

279
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:42,521
Yes sir.
I see. You are dismissed.

280
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,550
Maya.

281
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,243
You look great, Count Mayatola.

282
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,211
No, I mean Lady Maya.

283
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:15,252
Now you can say nothing against me
because you're exposed as a witch!

284
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,185
Pickingel, you set me up.

285
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,290
You must be the one who killed my father too!

286
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:31,832
Just wait! I will escape here,
and prove my innocence.

287
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,467
Then, I will kill you!

288
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,267
You really have guts.

289
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,235
It's such a waste that you are a woman.

290
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,371
I abandoned being a woman long ago!

291
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,973
<i>I am a man.</i>

292
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,013
You abandoned being a woman?

293
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,212
That's right.

294
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:51,919
Go ahead!

295
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,986
I will tolerate any kind of torture,
and then escape from here.

296
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,618
That sounds fun.

297
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:57,991
Do it!

298
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,165
Take this!

299
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,536
Help me!

300
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,841
Somebody help me!

301
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:15,842
Shut up!

302
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,610
You should accept your unlucky fate.

303
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,979
It is all because of that hermaphrodite, Maya.

304
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,224
Clory, don't go too wild.

305
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:31,588
Be careful not to destroy your toy
by too much wild play, like last time.

306
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,329
I'll come back later.

307
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,870
N- No! Don't do that!

308
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,664
No!

309
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,890
How is the taste of the whip?

310
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,635
You bastard!

311
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,474
What's so funny?

312
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,256
What is the matter, Count Pickingel?

313
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,223
You are acting strange.

314
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:41,426
If you get too excited,
your wound will open up again.

315
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,368
May I?

316
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:50,403
Even if the mind is a man,
the body is still a woman.

317
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,613
How is this? Do you feel good?

318
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:07,587
Relax and listen to your body.

319
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,456
Don't you feel good?

320
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,766
Do you feel your body?

321
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:26,776
Can't you feel your body melting away slowly?

322
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:34,877
Don't be in a rush. Slowly... slowly.

323
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:54,796
S- Stop it!

324
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,298
Stop...

325
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,206
Stop!

326
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,647
Don't touch me... you bitch!

327
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:17,094
Isabel.

328
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,562
Don't worry, I won't kill her.

329
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,459
How can I let her die so easily?

330
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,773
Maya, I've heard you are a
very skillful swordswoman...

331
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:36,678
Can you show me how skillful
you are, by using this sword?

332
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,074
Please...

333
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:50,389
Here... You can stab her with
your swords as much as you want.

334
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,137
Help me, Maya.

335
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,476
Please help me quickly.

336
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:48,518
I won't give in... I'm not a woman.

337
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,644
This is nothing...

338
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,282
I'm... I'm...

339
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,699
I'm...

340
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,731
Even if you try to think you are
a man, your body is woman.

341
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,167
I will slowly train you well,
starting tomorrow.

342
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,736
You are telling me to release Mayatola?

343
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:43,229
I can't believe these orders
are from General Nicklal.

344
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:47,634
Mayatola has kept secret
that she was a woman.

345
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,313
If she is not a witch,
why did she have to hide it?

346
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,542
W- Well, Count Calvin may
have had some odd ideas.

347
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:58,418
I heard Mayatola is the one
who killed Count Calvin.

348
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,548
Isn't that so, Count Pickingel?

349
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:01,787
That's right.

350
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,029
She must have used her magic powers
to manipulate Count Calvin,

351
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:08,430
and had him fooled ever since.

352
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,960
Well, I hope there was no one
else who has been manipulated.

353
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,806
I understand. I must be going.

354
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,825
Look. She seemed to have a
tough spirit in the beginning,

355
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,229
but I guess she gave up after having
lots of men, everyday, without a rest.

356
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,803
Well, she kept it up long enough.

357
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:47,236
I guess so.

358
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,939
Meal time.

359
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,815
Here you are. Don't spill it.

360
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,959
Oh, the sky looks threatening.

361
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,600
It looks like a storm is coming.

362
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,477
What good timing.

363
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,384
I was just about to bring you here.

364
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,779
No more silly talk.

365
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:44,593
Come. I'm escaping and
taking you as a hostage.

366
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,528
Would you like us to come with you?

367
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,437
I'm so disappointed.

368
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,100
Especially since I prepared this girl for you.

369
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,205
Anne?!

370
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:00,802
Why are you are here?

371
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,104
Put the sword down now...

372
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:07,449
...otherwise I don't know what
will happen to the girl.

373
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:12,315
Are you going to leave her behind,
so you can kill me and escape?

374
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,185
Stop it! Keep your hands off of her!

375
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:21,797
Can you really abandon her
and escape all by yourself?

376
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,848
Maya, you don't have to do
this if you don't want to.

377
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:47,256
Once you wear this brand,
you will never be able to escape.

378
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,828
Even if you did, people would find you
and execute you as a witch.

379
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:55,094
I know that! But in exchange,
you won't do anything to Anne.

380
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,727
Very well.

381
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,067
Hold her!

382
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:08,907
Look well. Your master is going to
suffer pain and writhe in agony.

383
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,147
Are you ready for this?

384
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,343
Just hurry up and do it.

385
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,348
Now you are neither man nor woman.

386
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:45,372
You are a witch.

387
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:52,214
I will purify the witch with my holy water.

388
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,753
Here, suck it well.

389
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,459
You are becoming a good girl.

390
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:15,503
<i>Anne, stdp! Stdp it.</i>

391
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:28,823
Well well... Your body's gotten soft,
so soon after you got the witch's emblem.

392
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:34,690
<i>W- Why?</i>

393
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,365
<i>My body is...</i>

394
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,595
<i>My body is...</i>

395
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,369
Maya, here we go.

396
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,012
This is just the beginning, Maya.

397
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,948
Let's take our time and enjoy.

398
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:05,087
<i>I feel hot. I feel like my body is
crushing me... from inside.</i>

399
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,851
<i>What is this?</i>

400
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,559
<i>Something is coming.</i>

401
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,829
<i>I'm scared... No, don't!</i>

402
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,015
I think it's over there.

403
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,164
Let's enjoy her again.

404
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,410
That's enough.

405
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,619
Where are you going?

406
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:50,952
Nowhere.

407
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,358
You are going to see Maya, aren't you?

408
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,662
What do you like about that hermaphrodite?

409
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,432
Count Pickingel!

410
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,207
It's been a long time.

411
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,536
Here is a little gift for you.

412
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,710
I haven't seen you since that day.
How long ago was it?

413
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,147
It's been over ten years.

414
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:19,086
I want to talk about the baby.

415
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,447
This wound...

416
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:25,088
I think of you every time this wound aches.

417
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,397
Oh, Maya...

418
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,691
I'm... I'm...

419
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:37,666
Maya.

420
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,603
Please don't stop, Maya!

421
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,009
I... Maya!

422
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,174
The reason your wound aches is because...

423
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,852
...you don't love Maya as a woman.

424
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,483
Here is the place you love very much.

425
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,659
You love Maya as a man.

426
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,056
I knew it.

427
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,660
You have been watching me.

428
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:05,632
Now, don't you really want to put it in here?

429
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,579
What's wrong with Count Pickingel,
and this castle?!

430
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,523
What's wrong with everything?!

431
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,220
Mayaaaaa...

432
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,701
Mayaaaaa...

433
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,127
Mayaaaaa...

434
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,503
Mayaaaaa...

435
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,905
W- What's going on?

436
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,672
What is this?!

437
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,448
Maya's a witch?!

438
00:40:56,487 --> 00:41:00,548
That's right. She is a witch
who carries on a sad destiny.

439
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,854
Nooooo!

440
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:10,123
Let me go! Stop it!

441
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,199
Stop it!

442
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,834
Help!

443
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:36,348
Men will be drawn to her and
start desiring her greatly.

444
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,524
She can have anything and
anyone with her magical power.

445
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:45,734
Men will hurt and kill each other
until everyone is destroyed.

446
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:49,270
Nobody can stop it. Even if they
know something is wrong.

447
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:53,973
Her awakening as a woman was
also her awakening as a witch.

448
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:58,270
I saw the strong magical power from that baby.

449
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,982
Is there nothing that can be done?

450
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,715
The seal holding her fate has been broken.

451
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:07,785
The only way to stop it is to kill her.

452
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:14,097
If you leave it be, her witchcraft
will consume and destroy everything.

453
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,733
Clory, kill that hermaphrodite!

454
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:21,070
She tricked these men and tried to kill me!

455
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:24,472
Kill her with the same hands
that killed her father!

456
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,813
After Maya dies, Pickingel
will begin the witch-hunt again.

457
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:32,509
And he will need my help again.

458
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,893
I ask again...

459
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,592
Is that really the only way to save her?

460
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,665
If you truly care for her...

461
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:50,697
I understand.

462
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,890
I'm the one who protects Maya.

463
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,769
Maya is mine. No one can take her!

464
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,306
This is cruel.

465
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,708
Good girl, Anne.

466
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,023
Maya...

467
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:29,729
Maya...

468
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,608
This sword belongs to Count Pickingel.

469
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:44,711
It can't be...

470
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:10,532
I don't need anything,
as long as you'll be with me.

471
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,918
Is this the magical power Maya possesses?

472
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:45,071
How dare you betray me
for this hermaphrodite!

473
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:55,811
Maya!

474
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:59,149
Please return to the Maya I know
before you become a witch completely.

475
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:03,555
You are overwhelmed by magical power.

476
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,819
I don't want this to happen.

477
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,924
If I let you become a witch, I would have to...

478
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,264
I would have to!

479
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:12,724
I would...

480
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:14,535
...have to kill you!

481
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,239
Forgive me, Maya!

482
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:05,441
Kill her!
Burn her!

483
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,042
Kill the witch!

484
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,738
Nicklal, the execution is over.

485
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:37,839
Yes madam. Then I will go back now.

486
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,140
Good work, Nicklal.

487
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,982
You must abolish these worthless
witch-hunts after this execution.

488
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,155
