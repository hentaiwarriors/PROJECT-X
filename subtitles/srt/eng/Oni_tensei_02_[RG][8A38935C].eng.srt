1
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,050
My name is Reiko Kure.

2
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:17,085
I'm a detective for the
Tokyo police department.

3
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:21,154
One day, I rescued a girl at
the scene of a ghastly murder.

4
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,030
She closed her mind obstinately, but...

5
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,669
...I saw my dark past in her eyes.

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:36,109
At the time, I still didn't know
how fateful that meeting would be...

7
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,906
Ema Nozomi...

8
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:43,749
<i>Soon</i> after, I started to see
suspicious shadows around her.

9
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:47,053
A nurse and my best
friend were attacked.

10
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:49,817
Each time, she was
scared by something...

11
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,289
...yet still blaming herself somehow.

12
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,330
What was she scared of?

13
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,461
Why would she do such a thing?

14
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:03,069
While I was at a loss because I could
neither understand nor help her...

15
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,704
...a mysterious man tried to end her life.

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,770
But...

17
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:13,283
...he was not the real danger
that has been haunting Nozomi.

18
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,717
Nozomi': real fear...

19
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,722
...and her real pain come from
the ogre, the tattoo on her back...

20
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,652
...which is able to come to life.

21
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:26,726
That's right...

22
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:28,788
The ogre exists...

23
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,929
The ogre on her back really exists.

24
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,861
I know it's hard to believe.

25
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,534
But I was raped by the ogre.

26
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,249
Please, sit down here.

27
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,763
Are you ready?

28
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:05,859
Yes...

29
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:19,912
Does it hurt?

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,984
I' m okay.

31
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,353
You have some lacerations...

32
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:27,151
I'll treat it for now.

33
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:38,492
We'll have to wait for
the result of the blood test.

34
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:41,737
How about semen?

35
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:42,539
Huh?

36
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,068
Is there any left?

37
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,069
I took care of it.

38
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,145
Do you think...

39
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,542
---"m Pregnant'?

40
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:55,847
Doctors can never be one
hundred percent sure.

41
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:58,315
That's true...

42
00:02:58,811 --> 00:02:59,653
Thank you.

43
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,782
All I'm saying is that we
have to wait for the result.

44
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:07,253
Please let me know if something
happens, I'll be glad to help you.

45
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,867
I appreciate your concern, Mr. Makabe.

46
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,061
Would you mind sending the
semen sample to the crime lab?

47
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,033
Who was it?

48
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,504
Did you know him?

49
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,174
An ogre...

50
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:36,882
I haven't told anyone
about that night yet.

51
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,328
I thought no one would believe it.

52
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,464
I was raped by...

53
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,108
...the tattoo of an ogre.

54
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:58,779
There you are.

55
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,179
Mr. Tagami.

56
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,113
How are things?

57
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:01,651
Okay-

58
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,647
She's not awake yet, but
she's passed the critical stage.

59
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,117
Not about Yasuko...

60
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:08,783
About you.

61
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,118
Huh?

62
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,622
The knife that the suspect left behind...

63
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:17,934
...matched the weapon
from the skinning case.

64
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:18,968
Really?

65
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,194
Yes .

66
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,336
It's not an ordinary knife.

67
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,306
It's been designed for skinning.

68
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:27,875
Psychotic criminal...

69
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,879
Where is Nozomi Ema now?

70
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,977
She should be back at the church.

71
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:34,746
She is in danger.

72
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:41,152
He was after the tattoo on
her back from the beginning.

73
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,631
She's not here.

74
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:52,564
What's the matter?

75
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,369
Nozomi...

76
00:04:55,261 --> 00:05:00,506
I know now that it was the only way
she felt she could show her appreciation.

77
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,975
She didn't want to
hurt anybody anymore.

78
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,313
No, please...

79
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:39,676
Flo!

80
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:52,960
Don't come out.

81
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,932
Please, don't come out...

82
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,270
I'll give myself to you, so...

83
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,177
Don't come out, please...

84
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,315
Please...

85
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,521
Don't come out!

86
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:30,456
Don't stop now!

87
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:33,395
Flo!

88
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,934
What are you doing, no!

89
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:35,902
Shut up!

90
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:38,708
If you scream, you'll get hurt.

91
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,068
Be quiet.

92
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,341
Don't come any closer.

93
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,710
Leave me alone!

94
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,448
What are you talking about?

95
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,339
You like touching yourself, don't you?

96
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,011
No!
You like touching yourself, don't you?

97
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,553
Move your damn hands!

98
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,381
Good...

99
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,295
You want me to do this, don't you?

100
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:04,868
See, you're wet...

101
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,463
Don't you feel good?

102
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:07,970
Don't...

103
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:08,901
Please...

104
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:11,698
Don't you like it?

105
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:12,969
No...

106
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,606
Please...

107
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,374
Leave me alone.

108
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,773
Are you sure, you're
loving this, aren't you?

109
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:25,252
I'll make you feel much better!

110
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,689
Take your clothes off!

111
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,792
W-What the...

112
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,420
W-Why do you have a tattoo like that?

113
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:36,630
For your own sake...

114
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:37,994
Run away now.

115
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,600
I like it.

116
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,670
What a great view.

117
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,410
We're gonna have fun!

118
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,277
No, stop it!

119
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,037
Are you ready?

120
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:50,837
There...

121
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,242
No, stop it!

122
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,811
Hey, he!!!

123
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,619
W-What?

124
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,876
Come on, who did this to you?

125
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,780
Not now, he's in a very bad condition.

126
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:27,972
Ask him later.

127
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:28,706
Come on, please...
Ask him later.

128
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:28,973
Come on, please...
Ask him later.

129
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:29,679
Come on, please...

130
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:31,713
Who did this to you?

131
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,852
O-O...

132
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,046
What?

133
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:35,313
What are you doing, officer?
What?

134
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,453
What are you doing, officer?

135
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,125
I feel sick.

136
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,556
After the skinning case,
it's a stabbing case.

137
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:44,560
SQ?

138
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:45,966
It's an ogre.

139
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,835
He said an ogre did it...

140
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:51,765
He probably saw an ogre
when he crossed the River Styx.

141
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,403
Let's go.

142
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,875
We'll lose face if we don't
solve these crimes soon...

143
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:57,841
Yes...

144
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:00,915
Nozomi...

145
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,375
Was that you?

146
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,423
Get out!

147
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,165
You can't run away naked, can you?

148
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,541
I' m sorry.

149
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,101
It's not your fault.

150
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:06,539
The doctor says if I continue physical
therapy, I will be able to walk again.

151
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,240
Good...

152
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:09,316
Are you all right?

153
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:13,122
I can't take a break until I find her.

154
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,920
You still can't forget about
what happened ten years ago?

155
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,195
Of course not.

156
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,063
If it didn't happen...

157
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,333
...I wouldn't have become...

158
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:25,395
...a detective.

159
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,763
Is this about revenge?

160
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:38,047
I wonder if an unwanted
life is still important...

161
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,450
Excuse me.

162
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:44,578
Huh?

163
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,520
May I ask you some questions?

164
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,784
Wait, open the door!

165
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,426
Open the door!

166
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:56,960
Shit...

167
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:01,662
O-Ouch...

168
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,804
All right!

169
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,599
I'm just holding it for my friend.

170
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,401
What are you talking about?

171
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,873
M-Marijuana, marijuana!

172
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,310
Marijuana?

173
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,650
We just wanted to ask you some
questions, why did you try to run?

174
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,643
You're <i>so</i> stupid.

175
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:21,084
Do you know this girl?

176
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,919
She has a tattoo of
an ogre on her back.

177
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,891
She's got some balls, huh?

178
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,759
She looks young too.

179
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,296
By the way, how about you?

180
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,394
I bet a fairy would look
beautiful on your back.

181
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,369
Flo!

182
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,129
Tattoos are only for lowlifes like you.

183
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,296
I'm not asking you.
Tattoos are only for lowlifes like you.

184
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,367
I'm not asking you.

185
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,471
I have one more question.

186
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,278
Do you know a tattoo
artist who can give life to a tattoo?

187
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,847
Life?

188
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:48,678
Kure?

189
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:54,351
His tattoos comes out from the
skin and moving as if they are alive...

190
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:59,790
...as if the have souls, and the person
with the tattoo has no control over it.

191
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,560
What are you talking about?

192
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,865
Tell me.

193
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,530
It's "Garyo Tensei."

194
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,461
What?

195
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,670
It's a story about a painted dragon.

196
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,198
I know that story, so?

197
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:13,671
Long ago, a famous painter drew a
dragon, and when he painted eyes on it...

198
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,176
...the dragon came to life
and went up into the sky.

199
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:23,477
I've heard that there is a tattoo
artist who gives life to his tattoos.

200
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,382
Nonsense.

201
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,090
It's just a myth.

202
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,458
Tell me...

203
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:31,621
...the name of the tattoo artist.

204
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,657
I think it was...

205
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,090
...Horioni.

206
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,676
If you want to kill me, do it now,
I have a splitting headache.

207
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,806
I won't kill you.

208
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,777
You are mine.

209
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,694
It's <i>so</i> beautiful.

210
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,728
It's <i>so</i> delicate and realistic...

211
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,930
It is living art...

212
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,931
This tattoo of Horioni's...

213
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,663
Horioni?

214
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,467
Horioni': tattoos are the best.

215
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:23,037
He's the only one in the world
who can draw a living tattoo.

216
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:24,713
Do you know him?

217
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,679
Do I know him?

218
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,449
I'm a student of Horioni.

219
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,921
This place used to be Horioni': studio.

220
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,220
Now, I'm renting here.

221
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,616
Where is he?

222
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,293
Let me see him!

223
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,026
The drugs should be working by now...

224
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:50,265
You took a tranquilizer
they use to mate horses.

225
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,639
If things go wrong, you might go mad.

226
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:01,083
Let yourself enjoy the
pleasant sensations...

227
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,717
...and show me the ogre.

228
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:33,942
You'll never make me...

229
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:37,786
...feel good.

230
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:39,185
What?

231
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:43,554
I'd rather die that let you
keep touching me like that.

232
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,225
Bitch!

233
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,464
I can kill you...

234
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,626
...whenever I want!

235
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:51,591
Look!

236
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:58,403
Aren't these beautiful?

237
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:01,936
This is my collection.

238
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,778
I'll add yours to these eventually.

239
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:13,317
You won't be able to scream,
and you'll live in my studio forever.

240
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:18,056
If you like tattoos so much,
why don't you get one?

241
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:28,231
Isn't it beautiful?

242
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,897
This is also by Horioni.

243
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,170
It's incomplete...

244
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,805
My body refused.

245
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:40,145
The swelling from the
needle lasted for three months.

246
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,183
Then Horioni left me.

247
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,722
But, I couldn't give up.

248
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:54,063
If I can't have a tattoo on my body,
I'll draw a better tattoo than Horioni's.

249
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,127
And this is what you came up with?

250
00:15:56,321 --> 00:16:00,167
Examining the real ones is the
best way to study on my own.

251
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,366
I'll ask you again...

252
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:07,100
Show me the ogre, for my art.

253
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:08,676
An?

254
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,536
You don't know...

255
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,115
I lost my parents
because of this ogre...

256
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,016
I won't show it to you...

257
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,319
I'd rather die than show you my ogre!

258
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:21,555
You bitch!

259
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:35,761
It's awful...

260
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,737
It's inhuman...

261
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,039
That's...

262
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,071
Nozomi!

263
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,309
Are you okay?

264
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:43,638
Mr. Tagami?

265
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:51,977
Mr. Tagami!

266
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:53,586
Don't move.

267
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,154
Oh, it's you.

268
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,491
You are...

269
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,956
He'll live if he gets help right now.

270
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,497
Don't...

271
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:05,867
Don't do it!

272
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:10,436
I'll tell you what to do.

273
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:19,372
Good, next, your underwear.

274
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,108
What's wrong, take it off.

275
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,317
Yes...

276
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,858
Kneel down and put it on.

277
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,100
You want to help her, right?

278
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,739
Your partner needs to be
treated <i>soon</i> or he'll die.

279
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:45,902
Well?

280
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:47,872
Yes .

281
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,005
Please...

282
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,815
Please help her and Mr. Tagami.

283
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,709
Please...

284
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:58,951
Please...

285
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:00,718
Help them...

286
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,654
Please...

287
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:06,921
Oh no!

288
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:08,224
You awake?

289
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,594
Hey!

290
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,757
Why are you here?

291
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:17,938
Look, she's going
to get fucked for you.

292
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:20,336
Lick it.

293
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,208
What's wrong?

294
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,876
Beg for forgiveness.

295
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,985
Apologize for disturbing my art.

296
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,588
Look at me and say you're sorry!

297
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,564
Stupid...

298
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,762
That's why I left you,
why did you come here?

299
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,273
You have nothing to do with me!

300
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:51,665
Yes, I do...

301
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,743
Hey, raise your hips higher.

302
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:01,406
It's not only your problem anymore...

303
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,893
No, stop it!

304
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:12,885
Please, stop it.

305
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,263
Shut up!

306
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,000
Flo!

307
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,201
It's all inside.

308
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:30,176
Look, she's your scapegoat.

309
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,678
Don't look away or I'll kill her!

310
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,909
Okay, that's good.

311
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,757
Please, don't...

312
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,395
No...

313
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,599
I said not to look away!

314
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,899
Some detective, isn't she?

315
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:54,797
She's thrusting her hips by herself.

316
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,498
Do you like your gun <i>so</i> much, huh?

317
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,037
Stop it, please!

318
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:03,712
Take it out, please...

319
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,003
Take it out!

320
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:07,041
Stop it, she's gonna die!

321
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:10,818
She gives her life for you...

322
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:13,047
I'll do whatever I want.

323
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:15,891
Good...

324
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,952
The most beautiful
moment is when people die.

325
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:21,925
Show me the moment!

326
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,334
No, stop it!

327
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,300
Show me...

328
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:31,767
Show me the moment of death!

329
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,240
Flo!

330
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,672
Flo!

331
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,793
I've taken the bullets out.

332
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,566
She passed out...

333
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,861
...or did she come?

334
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,081
L-Is this...

335
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,194
T-This is the ogre!

336
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:36,930
It's coming alive!

337
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,502
Wonderful!

338
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,204
It's Horioni's...

339
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,681
Show me the...

340
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:48,342
Show me the moment!

341
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,254
I told you to leave me alone.

342
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:29,982
I'm sorry but I can't stay with you.

343
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:33,218
I have to go look for someone.

344
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,363
Let go.

345
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:40,024
My period is late...

346
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,335
It's your baby...

347
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:44,773
It can't be!

348
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:50,608
I'll go with you and find the man
who drew the ogre on your back.

349
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,746
It's not only your problem anymore...

350
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,568
May I help you?

351
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,603
Are you looking for Horioni?

352
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:18,967
W-Who are you?

353
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,011
Leave Horioni alone.
