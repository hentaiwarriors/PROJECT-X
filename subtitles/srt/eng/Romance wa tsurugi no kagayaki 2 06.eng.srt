1
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:25,268
No...

2
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:29,474
No... I can't take it... No.

3
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:43,380
No... please.

4
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:45,513
Stop.

5
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:50,262
How about this, then?

6
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:05,505
It hurts... more... harder... no...

7
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,110
This way? Or this way?

8
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,907
Give it to me.

9
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:14,117
That's right...

10
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:22,158
That's good... lt feels so good... just right.

11
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:28,031
Come, please, quick. Please.

12
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:50,255
It hurts... no...

13
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:53,121
More... more...

14
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:58,324
I'm going crazy...

15
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:05,531
Good.

16
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:13,944
Come on now! Unlock and reopen
the gate that's been closed far too long.

17
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:47,571
So, this woman isn't the right one either.

18
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:57,346
Will my wish ever come true?

19
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:18,869
Who's this?

20
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:28,754
It's her! I finally found the right woman.

21
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:35,160
Go! And bring that woman to me!

22
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:51,406
Romance is in the Flash of the Sword II

23
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:58,112
Episode 6 "Oh no... is this the very last!?"

24
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:13,558
Mr. Angel...

25
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:25,971
But he's... but he's... my Mr. Angel...

26
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:33,143
Hmm? It's just that...?

27
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:44,764
Mr. Angel... Gramps, let's go home...

28
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:50,969
Yes, my lady...

29
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:05,548
If only we could stay like this forever...

30
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:06,779
What?

31
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:10,954
Oh, it's really nothing...

32
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:17,862
Hey! That's Elfarcia.

33
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:25,165
Wait!

34
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:34,837
It was Elfarcia!
She brought this to me and then...

35
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:48,351
Take this blow!

36
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,190
What the hell! Shit!

37
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:07,109
Elfarcia!

38
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:11,878
I'm coming, my lady!

39
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,350
Save Elfarcia! Hurry!

40
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:23,051
Right!

41
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:35,735
Damn it!

42
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:38,433
Not quite yet! Just hold tight!

43
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:52,216
Hold on! No worries!

44
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,842
Isn't that Keith over there?

45
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:15,808
Oh, no! Just as soon as we find him,
he runs after another girl!

46
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:19,179
He's always running after
other girls he sees.

47
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:32,988
A servant demon of an evil wizard?
You mean that disgusting monster?

48
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:34,591
That's right.

49
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:39,561
It's been rumored that within the ruins
in that lake lives a powerful wizard...

50
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:42,607
and for centuries he has wanted to
destroy the world.

51
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:47,635
They say he commits evil acts against any
travelers or villagers who come close.

52
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,615
But why does he want to destroy the world?
It doesn't make sense.

53
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:54,746
From what I hear,
he wants to change the world...

54
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,517
...so that it will look like
the place he used to live.

55
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:08,127
That story, I want you
to tell me more about it.

56
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:09,895
What are you?

57
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:14,565
A priestess warrior, Rena Carmine.
A friend of Keith.

58
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:16,506
A friend of Keith?

59
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:23,374
We serve food here,
so will you leave your dog outside?

60
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:30,354
He's not a dog, but Albion, out.

61
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:36,990
If the rumor's true, and evil wizard lives...

62
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:43,161
that might explain a number of recent,
mysterious disasters and disappearances.

63
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:48,538
We've lost track.

64
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:52,768
Oh no... my lady...

65
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:08,051
My lady!

66
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:09,492
Elfarcia!

67
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,333
Mr. Angel is... here to rescue me...?

68
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:22,563
Help me!

69
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:25,604
My lady!

70
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:30,873
Brought some extra trouble with her,
so it seems.

71
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:35,818
Please... let me go...

72
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:46,157
Welcome. I apologize for the rough
invitation, my lady. I hope you accept.

73
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,190
And, you are...?

74
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:25,800
I finally found her...

75
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:35,737
I'll fall!

76
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,675
Like I said, this cliff's... too tough.

77
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,081
Please don't worry.

78
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:46,122
I'm prepared to go through
fire and brimstone to save my lady.

79
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:48,786
Anything for her sake, so help me!

80
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:54,390
Yeah, I understand, but to tell the truth,
you're more of a burden than anything else.

81
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:06,601
Finally, we've got rid of that extra trouble...
Hmm? That's enough! Stop that!

82
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:20,190
I have a deep relationship with Keith,
you see.

83
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:25,960
Your relationship? I think mine's
much deeper than yours, you know.

84
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:31,562
How silly they are. Depth. It is with me.

85
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:33,463
He's popular.

86
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,530
Oh, he's my Keith.

87
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:48,744
The ritual to transform the world
is about to begin!

88
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:00,761
Are you alright?

89
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:02,757
Hey!

90
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,764
Please, you must go on without me
and rescue my lady at all cost.

91
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:10,533
Just promise me.

92
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:16,409
Now, no more load on me. Now I can
move faster. Alright! Time to speed up!!

93
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:49,208
Elfarcia! Where... where are you?

94
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:55,517
Elfarcia... where are you?

95
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:27,846
Wake up.

96
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,287
You and I shall change
and transform this world...

97
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:36,158
so that it will resemble where
I can no longer return... my home world.

98
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:43,825
Elfarcia! Shit, she's nowhere.

99
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:51,733
Elfarcia... Hmm? What's this sound I hear?

100
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,482
It's this way?

101
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,892
Now, come here...

102
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:33,111
Now, let us unite!

103
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,811
Get wet! Get wet! Wet yourself!

104
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,589
Elfarcia!

105
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:54,996
Just a bit more...

106
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:11,821
Elfarcia! Elfarcia!

107
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:14,249
Tut, how is he still alive!?

108
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:18,295
Elfarcia! Damn it!

109
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:51,886
Can't you move anymore? That's no fun.
Now, you die!

110
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:58,028
Well done, my friend.
How will you escape now?

111
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:06,267
Spika!

112
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:07,436
Keith!

113
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:11,006
Jannette... Why you're here?

114
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,106
Meddlers!

115
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:29,624
Keith! We're here to rescue you!

116
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:31,997
What?!

117
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:37,542
A priestess warrior?!

118
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:42,111
Tell me, are you the wizard
who defiles god?

119
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:48,142
Good! Well done!

120
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:51,722
She's in trouble!

121
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:53,148
Here goes!

122
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,556
We'll lose our balance!

123
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:57,160
Help!

124
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,530
Fireball!

125
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:16,505
Albion!

126
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:21,648
For my lady I will withstand any torture...

127
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:24,189
rocks, arrows, slings... even rectal itch!

128
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:26,889
I will do it!

129
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:31,088
I never said anything about monsters
raining down on me!

130
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:45,841
Oh no, I'm back at the bottom again.
Oh no, my dear lady!

131
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,706
Don't scare me!

132
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,143
Let go!

133
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:57,178
I won't!
I won't give up Elfarcia to anyone!

134
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,379
Keith...

135
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:02,490
Keith... please.

136
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:05,657
Elfarcia belongs to me.

137
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,492
Mr. Angel...

138
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:13,371
How obstinate... Tell me, who are you?

139
00:18:15,408 --> 00:18:17,069
Keith Ryan!

140
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,677
The famous thief known throughout
the Continent of Destragoon? It can't be.

141
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:28,346
I'm the rightful successor to the greatest
thief of this century, the Shadow Blade!

142
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:31,119
Today, that lineage will be terminated.

143
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:34,860
So far, it's been just foreplay.

144
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:39,460
In the name of the world, which I'm about
to transform with this woman...

145
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:42,262
let me inflict much greater destruction...

146
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:19,561
Mr. Angel, please escape and don't die...

147
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:26,068
Elfarcia, I came here just to rescue you!
Until I do, I won't die!

148
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:27,946
Mr. Angel...

149
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:39,053
You, bitch! What did you do?

150
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:46,454
Keith... I hope he's alright...

151
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,620
I'll return right away and organize
a search and rescue operation...

152
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:53,722
No, you don't.
That's just "inconsiderate" I say.

153
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:55,823
She's right on.

154
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:01,635
Well, you see,
that's how fate would have it...

155
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:05,905
Hey! I'll take them all back!
Don't worry! Okay?

156
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:07,946
Thanks so much, Bagas!

157
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,804
Now everyone...

158
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:14,208
Well now, he's acting like a man.
So what happened to him?

159
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:19,581
I know it wasn't part of our plan,
but I'm glad we could set these girls free.

160
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:24,719
Now that the wizard's spell is gone,
they don't seem to remember anything.

161
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:28,762
I don't know, they all seem
like they're from wealthy families.

162
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:33,562
I think he's just after gifts of gratitude.
He'll get to know where they live.

163
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:37,234
And if all goes well, he could end up
marrying one of these rich women.

164
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:39,707
You never know. Oh, boy.

165
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:44,176
Now, everyone!
I, Bagas, will take you home safely.

166
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:46,718
Yes!

167
00:21:56,895 --> 00:22:00,888
I mistakenly thought you were an angel.
I really did, you know.

168
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:05,364
I am a thief, who's after your heart.
You didn't know that?

169
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:10,602
Keith Ryan, why don't you steal me?

170
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:13,171
Please steal me, Keith Ryan.

171
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:19,609
Alright.

172
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:28,058
You're warm...

173
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:53,174
Please, Keith, please be gentle.

174
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:02,460
I'm embarrassed.

175
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:09,727
No... don't hurt me...

176
00:23:11,704 --> 00:23:13,228
Don't tease me...

177
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:17,165
It hurts.

178
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:21,643
Oh, no... no... no.

179
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,474
Please, please, no.

180
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:46,267
Mr. Angel...

181
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:49,634
It's like flying!

182
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:52,065
Fly, baby!

183
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:57,577
Feels so good.

184
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:20,031
Mr. Angel... Keith... you're so warm.

185
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,967
I'm hot... l'm burning up...

186
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:26,870
No... l'm coming...

187
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:31,542
Keith... Keith... Keith...

188
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:55,467
Beautiful!

189
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:58,032
You're more beautiful.

190
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:30,505
The End
