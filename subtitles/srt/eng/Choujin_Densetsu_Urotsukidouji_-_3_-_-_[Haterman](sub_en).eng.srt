619
00:00:15,663 --> 00:00:18,632
According to legend,
once every 3000 years...

620
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:21,634
...the Overfiend is reborn
into this world to...

621
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:24,603
...unify the human, demon
and beast realms...

622
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:27,232
...and build an
eternal kingdom.

623
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:30,243
Amano Jyaku, a beast,
has come to the...

624
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:33,246
...human realm in search
of the legendary Overfiend.

625
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:36,249
His prime candidate
is Tatsuo Nagumo...

626
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:39,252
...a seemingly ordinary
college student.

627
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,255
Meanwhile, Suikakujyu,
of the demon realm...

628
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:45,258
...a realm opposed
to that of the beasts...

629
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:48,261
...fears the rebirth
of the Overfiend...

630
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,264
...and sent his minions
to attack Nagumo.

631
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:54,267
As if moved by Fate, Nagumo
approached Akemi lto...

632
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:57,270
...the idol of the school,
and fell in love with her.

633
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:00,273
Niki, a classmate of Nagumo's,
also fell in love with her...

634
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:03,276
...and sold his soul to a
demon to transform himself...

635
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:07,280
...into a powerful monster
to destroy Nagumo.

636
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:11,284
But when Nagumo was attacked.
A "power" awakened within him...

637
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:15,288
...changing him into the "Overfiend"
and causing him to murder Niki.

638
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:19,292
While observing the ugly scene,
Amano Jyaku began to wonder...

639
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,295
...if Nagumo was in fact
the true Overfiend...

640
00:01:22,363 --> 00:01:26,299
...and what the promised
"eternal kingdom" would be like.

641
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:30,303
In response to his request,
the Elder of the beast realm...

642
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:34,307
...has sent Amano Jyaku into
the future to seek the truth.

643
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:47,945
Where am I?

644
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:01,991
What's all this? Is this the
human world of the future?

645
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,994
It can't be!

646
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:10,343
Where'd that senile
old bastard send me?

647
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:16,709
I see. So this is Osaka?

648
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:29,786
Now what?

649
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:42,902
The Overfiend?

650
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:05,593
Save us!
Save us, Lady lto!

651
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,398
Lady lto?

652
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:12,235
Help me!
Please, help me!

653
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,411
For pity's sake!

654
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:24,974
Take me to
Lady lto at the castle!

655
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:28,417
Are you talking
about Akemi?

656
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:55,077
What?!
Why's he doing this?

657
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:14,935
What the...?!
It's Osaka Castle.

658
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:23,807
Why isn't it damaged?

659
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,812
That's it! The secret of the
Overfiend legend is in there!

660
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:37,681
More time, Elder!
I'm almost through!

661
00:04:37,758 --> 00:04:39,487
Come on, you old fart!
Elder!

662
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:46,834
The secret to the whole
legend is in there! Please!

663
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:50,899
Just a little more time!

664
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:54,168
There's something here!
Let me see!

665
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:03,483
UROTSUKIDOJI
Legend of the Overfiend

666
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:06,281
Part 3
"Final Inferno"

667
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:14,187
I beg the Gods
not to forsake him...

668
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:18,821
Return Suikakujyu
to life and to me.

669
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:23,529
I beg you all,
now and forever.

670
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:28,541
Protect him! Revive him!
Let him live again!

671
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:36,746
O deities of all the realms...

672
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:43,120
return my love to me.

673
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,231
Suikakujyu, my love...

674
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:08,245
I lack the strength
to be reborn...

675
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:14,921
Fukakuki... Enkakuki...
Give me your bodies...

676
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:14,431
Suikakujyu...

677
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,767
My Queen...

678
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:28,272
Suikakujyu, something is
happening in the human world.

679
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:35,618
The demon realm will be
destroyed if it isn't stopped.

680
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:39,456
Hurry... You must kill
the Overfiend now!

681
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:48,297
You're my only hope...

682
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:51,300
By your command.

683
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:57,476
Nagumo!

684
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:07,476
Nagumo...

685
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:18,528
As long as I'm with you,
Akemi... I'll protect you.

686
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:21,791
I'll protect you...

687
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:25,237
You will protect me,
won't you, Nagumo?

688
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:31,972
Of course...

689
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:35,672
Nagumo...

690
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:08,039
I... I'm a monster...

691
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,571
Nagumo?

692
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:39,237
Nagumo, it's me.

693
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:40,803
Go away.

694
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:46,779
I'm not human
anymore. Please...

695
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,220
Nagumo, open up.

696
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:57,092
No.

697
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,058
It was a lie,
wasn't it?

698
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:05,002
That stuff about always
being there for me.

699
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:08,707
I love you, Nagumo...

700
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:13,345
I don't care what's
happened to you...

701
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:17,112
I just know I love you!

702
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:19,352
Akemi...

703
00:12:29,963 --> 00:12:31,624
Nagumo...

704
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:38,168
I love you.

705
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:40,297
I love you, too.

706
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:45,975
Don't let me go!
Never let me go again!

707
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:03,326
Fantastic...

708
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:09,335
What'll we do now?

709
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:12,566
Let 'em have fun.

710
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,918
You've returned?

711
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:33,921
Elder!

712
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:41,696
I'm done for. I've used
the last of my power.

713
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,667
What're you saying?!
Hang on, you old fool!

714
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,707
Amano Jyaku!

715
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:53,872
I saw the future
through your eyes.

716
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:59,713
Then tell me: Was that really
the future of the 3 realms?

717
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,948
Elder!

718
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:05,651
Amano Jyaku...

719
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:09,718
The only thing I can say is
the eternal kingdom...

720
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:13,698
...the Overfiend will build
may be very different...

721
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:20,229
...from the demon, beast and
human worlds as they exist now.

722
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,176
What?

723
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:43,819
You're beautiful, Akemi.

724
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:53,097
Why...
Why are you crying?

725
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:56,199
I'm happy.

726
00:14:57,277 --> 00:15:02,214
We'll be joined forever now,
body and soul.

727
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:04,910
And no one will ever
stand between us again.

728
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:06,475
Never...

729
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:10,455
No one will
ever separate us.

730
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:15,120
I'll never let anyone
do that... Akemi!

731
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:19,121
Nagumo...!

732
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,130
May I?

733
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:38,475
Nagumo!

734
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:20,359
L- l-
Oh god, I...!

735
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:29,862
I can't...!

736
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:46,379
Please...!
Not so hard...

737
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:54,482
Nagumo...

738
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:58,386
He's changing...

739
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,512
Nagumo...

740
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:40,723
Nagumo!

741
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:46,114
The 3 realms
are collapsing!

742
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:48,616
ELDER!!!

743
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,829
Run!

744
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,707
It's the Overfiend!

745
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:49,570
Horrible...!

746
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,250
This is the Overfiend?

747
00:23:02,328 --> 00:23:06,264
The god above all others?

748
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,036
He's an enemy!
The devil! KILL HIM!!

749
00:23:11,604 --> 00:23:13,299
No! You'll die!

750
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:45,799
Megumi!

751
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:48,500
Big brother!

752
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:49,802
Boss!

753
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:55,303
Look! He's just
killing at random.

754
00:23:56,983 --> 00:24:02,148
Is that all he was born
to do? Big brother?!

755
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:06,984
Nagumo...
Why...? Why?!

756
00:24:15,168 --> 00:24:16,157
What the...?

757
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:28,339
That chant... No...! He's trying
the same thing he did 70 years ago!

758
00:24:43,696 --> 00:24:47,029
Amano Jyaku! It's too late!

759
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,196
I, Suikakujyu, control
the Demon King of the Sea!

760
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,034
This will finally
destroy the Overfiend!

761
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:29,401
What the...?
What's he trying to do?

762
00:27:11,177 --> 00:27:12,508
NO!

763
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:17,565
Amano Jyaku!

764
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:22,743
It's time you
faced the truth.

765
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:24,950
Suikakujyu...

766
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:31,917
Amano Jyaku... The 3 realms
will never be as they were.

767
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:35,925
This is what the
Overfiend really is.

768
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:42,867
A devil, bent on destroying the
human, beast, and demon worlds.

769
00:28:43,836 --> 00:28:49,638
But... there's still time.
Kill him!

770
00:28:50,276 --> 00:28:53,268
He's still weak
from the battle.

771
00:28:53,346 --> 00:28:57,612
Use this chance
to destroy him.

772
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:01,949
Now that the Demon King
of the Sea is dead...

773
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:08,791
Our only hope is you,
Amano Jyaku...

774
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:17,964
I beg you!
He will destroy every...

775
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:36,613
Nagumo... Have I wandered
for 300 years just for this?!

776
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:39,157
Just to find a
bastard like you?

777
00:29:57,176 --> 00:29:58,700
Big brother...

778
00:29:58,778 --> 00:30:01,679
Boss! You gotta
kill him, quick!

779
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:11,450
Nagumo! Even me?!

780
00:30:16,095 --> 00:30:18,029
Nagumo!
Change back!

781
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:21,555
Stop being the
Overfiend! Nagumo!

782
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,532
Boss!

783
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:32,101
Kuroko!

784
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:36,046
Why are you hesitating?
This isn't like you!

785
00:30:36,115 --> 00:30:37,309
KUROKO!

786
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:47,058
MEGUMI!

787
00:30:54,733 --> 00:31:01,138
Nagumo! Why are you
doing this to me?

788
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,607
Nagumo! Nagumo...

789
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,075
Stop it! Nagumo...

790
00:31:33,606 --> 00:31:39,238
Nagumo! Damn you!
I'll never forgive you!

791
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:45,773
Give me back Kuroko!
Give me back my sister!

792
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:38,826
Amano Jyaku...

793
00:32:52,084 --> 00:32:57,852
Akemi, why...? What are you
doing here?! Akemi!

794
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:00,518
It's no use
calling her name.

795
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:05,759
Mama no longer
has human feelings.

796
00:33:06,265 --> 00:33:07,254
Mama?

797
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:13,270
Yes. I'm speaking to
you from her body.

798
00:33:15,207 --> 00:33:18,142
What?
Then... you're...

799
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,873
Yes. I am the child of
Nagumo and Akemi.

800
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:26,844
The true Overfiend
you've been looking for.

801
00:33:28,554 --> 00:33:31,352
The true Overfiend?!
Then what's Nagumo...?

802
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:34,882
What the hell is he?

803
00:33:39,632 --> 00:33:42,294
Merely a male,
necessary to give me life.

804
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:46,771
And now he's become
the Demon of Destruction...

805
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:50,036
...who must destroy the 3 realms
so that I may be reborn!

806
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:52,143
Demon of Destruction?!

807
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:03,911
Papa is destroying all the
worlds for my sake.

808
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:08,588
Why?

809
00:34:10,763 --> 00:34:14,426
Because it was decided
3000 years ago.

810
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:17,625
3000 years ago?

811
00:34:19,271 --> 00:34:23,765
Yes. 3000 years ago,
so as to bring order to chaos...

812
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:27,938
I created the human
world you know today...

813
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:33,276
At the same time I made
two other worlds:

814
00:34:35,187 --> 00:34:39,283
A world of man-beasts,
for the superhuman...

815
00:34:41,794 --> 00:34:45,958
And of demons, for those
who could not become human.

816
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:51,302
Thus were born the
beast and demon realms.

817
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:56,635
And, at that time,
I made a promise...

818
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:02,636
In 3000 years,
I shall be reborn.

819
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:10,651
If I find that humans are "good,"
then all will be as planned.

820
00:35:12,524 --> 00:35:16,221
But, if I find that
they have become "evil..."

821
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:21,665
...I shall reduce the worlds to
void and begin again!

822
00:35:25,237 --> 00:35:28,263
That's the real legend
of the Overfiend?!

823
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:35,310
Humanity hasn't
become what I intended.

824
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:39,347
So now I have to start over.

825
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:44,813
The humans must be destroyed
so that I can replace them.

826
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,687
What?!

827
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:52,026
You're saying you'll
destroy the 3 realms...

828
00:35:52,097 --> 00:35:56,033
...just so you
can be reborn?

829
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,268
DAMN YOU!!!!

830
00:36:14,553 --> 00:36:16,043
Amano Jyaku...

831
00:36:22,728 --> 00:36:26,220
Amano Jyaku,
don't be foolish...

832
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:35,570
There's nothing I
can do to stop this?

833
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:40,072
Nagumo, stop it!

834
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:46,278
I like the world
the way it is...

835
00:36:58,096 --> 00:36:59,757
Nagumo!

836
00:37:09,942 --> 00:37:12,103
I thought I'd erased all
of Mama's consciousness.

837
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:15,102
How can she be...

838
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:19,106
A-ma-no...

839
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:33,955
Amano!

840
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:38,630
Amano... It's all right.
Take it easy...

841
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,138
Akemi...?

842
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,437
Amano.

843
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:56,178
I'll help you. Come on.
Get out of here... Hurry!

844
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:07,294
Akemi...!

845
00:38:32,524 --> 00:38:33,513
Megumi!

846
00:38:34,026 --> 00:38:35,516
Big brother...

847
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:38,521
Megumi... you're...

848
00:38:52,778 --> 00:38:54,211
Nagumo...

849
00:38:56,615 --> 00:38:58,207
Nagumo...

850
00:39:00,552 --> 00:39:03,214
You still know me,
don't you?

851
00:39:04,456 --> 00:39:07,721
With all your power,
you can easily kill me.

852
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:17,231
End my life now,
while I still love you.

853
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:22,239
What're they...?

854
00:39:23,742 --> 00:39:26,734
I don't want the Overfiend
to control me.

855
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:30,577
I won't live as a tool.
I won't!

856
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,719
If you kill me,
the Overfiend will die, too.

857
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:37,118
And you, Nagumo.

858
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:41,592
Nagumo, let's choose
to die together. Together...

859
00:39:43,662 --> 00:39:46,756
A... ke... mi...

860
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,276
Nagumo...

861
00:40:02,848 --> 00:40:07,285
Nagumo!
KILL ME NOW!

862
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:22,290
Mama... Papa... You can't.
This is our destiny.

863
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:38,481
NO!!!

864
00:40:41,553 --> 00:40:45,649
Amano Jyaku,
this is as it must be.

865
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:49,984
Mama cannot die before
she gives birth to me.

866
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:54,454
And Papa cannot die before
he's destroyed the 3 realms.

867
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:59,501
Stop it! Change them
back to themselves!

868
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:29,023
Stop it...
Overfiend, please...

869
00:41:31,203 --> 00:41:34,366
Do not grieve,
Amano Jyaku.

870
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:41,704
When I create the new
worlds, centuries from now...

871
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,716
...they will be reborn,
as they appear now.

872
00:41:46,785 --> 00:41:51,552
You will?
Do you mean that?!

873
00:41:51,623 --> 00:41:56,560
I do. And they'll love
each other, as in this life.

874
00:41:58,163 --> 00:42:03,066
All destruction leads to rebirth.
This a beginning, not an end.

875
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:08,401
Can you live to see the
new world, Amano Jyaku?

876
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:17,376
So that's it?
Sure, I'll live.

877
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:19,076
A hundred years,
a thousand...

878
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:22,743
I'll just keep on wandering
until I see the future...

879
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:25,984
Yours,
Nagumo's, Akemi's...

880
00:42:26,925 --> 00:42:30,759
And until I do...
I WILL NOT DIE!!!

881
00:43:19,578 --> 00:43:23,378
O arrogant humanity!

882
00:43:23,448 --> 00:43:28,476
Not all that exists is
visible to your mortal eyes!

883
00:43:28,553 --> 00:43:31,488
Our world consists
of the realm of humans...

884
00:43:31,556 --> 00:43:34,650
...the realm of beasts,
and the realm of demons.

885
00:43:37,095 --> 00:43:41,657
There is a legend shared by
the beasts and the demons.

886
00:43:42,767 --> 00:43:48,672
That once, every 3000 years,
the Overfiend revives.

887
00:43:50,508 --> 00:43:55,502
And upon his revival,
the three realms are...

888
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:00,176
...united to form
an eternal kingdom.

889
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:05,186
O arrogant humanity!

890
00:44:06,524 --> 00:44:10,358
Humans are not the
supreme rulers of all.

891
00:44:11,863 --> 00:44:17,267
You shall know the truth
when the Overfiend revives.
