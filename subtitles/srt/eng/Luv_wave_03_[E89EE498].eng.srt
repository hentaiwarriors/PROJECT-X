1
00:00:02,927 --> 00:00:04,519
Kiyoka.

2
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,803
System returned to normal.

3
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,873
What's wrong?

4
00:00:18,076 --> 00:00:20,806
I detected a malfunction in the tank
for a split second.

5
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,468
But now I am back online.

6
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,979
You'd better have Kanako look at you.

7
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:28,641
No, I would like you
to perform maintenance.

8
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:31,445
Me?

9
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:33,254
Yes.

10
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:36,593
Please.

11
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:52,574
"Necross."

12
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:08,181
I don't get it. What can I...

13
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:15,455
There is a desire to feel
you physically. I...

14
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:18,561
Please have sex with me.

15
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,101
What?

16
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:23,732
Kaoru, you had sex with Kanako.

17
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:25,641
You...

18
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:28,434
You were asleep at that time.

19
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:34,078
I was connected to the circuit
in the room.

20
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:36,910
I was able to monitor your activities.

21
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:43,787
Damn Kanako.

22
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:45,519
May I?

23
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:48,257
May I have a permission...

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,766
May I have a permission
to kiss your lips?

25
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,535
What?

26
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:55,500
Was that funny?

27
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,603
Not a very ordinary conversation.

28
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:03,213
This is difficult.

29
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:19,596
You...

30
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,255
When did you learn to do this?

31
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:24,493
I watched the Adult Channel on TV.

32
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:27,766
I concluded that, this would increase
your erection ratio...

33
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:31,240
thus enabling
smoother penetration.

34
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:32,842
The way you talk...

35
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:35,468
That's enough to get me soft.

36
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,439
Soft. Slacken. Shrink.

37
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:41,780
You must not!

38
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:46,046
This is so strange.

39
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,974
Oil leak?

40
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,209
Why are you so wet?

41
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:10,881
I have a feature to enable
smoother penetration.

42
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,679
My specification states I can perform
missions that require sexual activities...

43
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:18,046
I'm telling you to stop talking
like that.

44
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:27,192
Abnormally high physical sensation!

45
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:30,391
Need for controlling sensual
organ overdrive.

46
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:34,004
Endangering logic circuit!

47
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:48,646
Alice, are you afraid?

48
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:50,246
What?

49
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,546
Can't you trust me?

50
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:56,150
Yes. I trust you.

51
00:03:57,128 --> 00:03:59,619
I am losing all my abilities.

52
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:08,736
To hand over all of my functions is...

53
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:12,107
it is scary, but I am glad.

54
00:04:12,743 --> 00:04:15,940
The emotion of gratitude
is overwhelming.

55
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,109
This is too much.

56
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:29,924
I'm unable to control areas
surrounding my vaginal organs.

57
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:33,123
This is abnormal.

58
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:37,359
Abnormal.

59
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,565
Yes?

60
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:41,932
Abnormal means you're normal.

61
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,832
What do you mean?

62
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:48,440
No, not that.

63
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,242
No more abnormality, please, Kaoru.

64
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,598
Is it your...

65
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,597
Here we go.

66
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:22,340
I feel it.
You are connected with me.

67
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:29,576
You're warm inside.

68
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:34,521
I am connected with you, not
through information, but physically.

69
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:38,627
My emotion is filled with you, Kaoru.

70
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,726
You're a poet.

71
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,543
Something...

72
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:10,023
Something is abnormal.

73
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:14,996
Kaoru, no more. No more.

74
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:22,062
Alice.

75
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:34,412
What was that?

76
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:37,350
Surpassing sense organ limitation.

77
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,289
I am becoming abnormal.

78
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:55,866
I cannot control...

79
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,407
out of control.

80
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:07,141
I cannot. No more.

81
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,396
What was that?

82
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,339
Finally, completely.

83
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:35,042
What?

84
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:42,783
It's been a while, Kaoru.

85
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,549
Alice, what are you saying?

86
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:47,520
Alice is gone.

87
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:50,360
Because I'm back.

88
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:52,655
Aren't you happy?

89
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:55,129
Get a hold of yourself, Alice!

90
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,762
I see. Kaoru, your memory...

91
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,695
My memory?

92
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:04,739
I have to go, Kaoru.

93
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:07,400
When you get your
memory back...

94
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,440
come to see me.

95
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,874
I love you, Kaoru.

96
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,979
You're mine.

97
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:21,991
"Xinn?"

98
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,959
Xinn.

99
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,290
Got a nice ring to it.

100
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,427
It sounds like "God" in Japanese.

101
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,161
"God."

102
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,599
And what about it?

103
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,201
Kaoru, come to my home today.

104
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,169
To your home?

105
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:42,871
Tonight, I become God.

106
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:46,011
That's what Dad says.

107
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:01,796
Yes. Mayumi.
My high school sweetheart.

108
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,166
I did go to Mayumi's house
that day.

109
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:10,306
What're you doing,
Mr. Mikogami?

110
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:13,065
Where's Alice? Is she there?

111
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:15,636
Do you see anything unusual?

112
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:17,237
Alice?

113
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,582
What about Alice?

114
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:41,870
Dyne Wiseman, president of
Digital Demand Corp.

115
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:47,637
She used to be Dr. Wezmar's
assistant and mistress.

116
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:54,816
There is a high probability she
maintains contact with Dr. Wezmar.

117
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:58,321
Dyne should know
Alice's whereabouts.

118
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:10,663
I have locked out Wiseman's
security system.

119
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,267
Roger.

120
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:14,333
How much time do I have?

121
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:16,835
I'll do my best, but...

122
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:21,439
my limit would be
about 30 minutes.

123
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,320
Not even the phone?
What's going on?

124
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,030
You?

125
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:47,466
Kaoru Mikogami.

126
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:51,867
I put your "star" to sleep.

127
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,336
So you hacked
my surveillance satellite.

128
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,477
What's this about, Mikogami?

129
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:58,648
That's it.

130
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,117
You're a civilian.

131
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:04,452
How could you know my name?

132
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:10,351
That's what it's about.
Miss Wiseman.

133
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:23,600
Don't you ever think...

134
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:27,867
you can get away with this.

135
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:30,943
What are your objectives?

136
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,581
Answer me!

137
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:49,622
Don't.

138
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:52,125
Our objective is...

139
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:56,233
To resurrect and awaken Mayumi.

140
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,400
Thereby creating God.

141
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:01,508
Any more than that...

142
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,215
No! Please don't stop.

143
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:10,414
You want to talk now?

144
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:14,115
If a person can take the entire...

145
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,888
Network on this planet
and put it under his control.

146
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:20,329
Please, do my back end, too.

147
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:24,025
If he can, then what?

148
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,165
Then it would be the same
as being God.

149
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,504
It's possible if you activate Xinn.

150
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,515
Please put it in. I'm going crazy.

151
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:43,582
Give me more information,
and I'll give you more.

152
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:47,015
What the hell is Xinn?

153
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:49,254
Xinn happened...

154
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:52,856
because Mayumi's psyche, asleep in
the Network...

155
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,426
tried to find a host...

156
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:02,928
and run a search throughout
the entire planet.

157
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:07,243
If we can apply this to...

158
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,347
Incredible!

159
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,606
I'm coming again.

160
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:19,287
This is his job.

161
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:24,456
I know it's his job, but still...

162
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,992
- Hey, look!
- What?

163
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:29,222
Shit!

164
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,060
Mr. Mikogami, you're running
out of time!

165
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,134
What's going on?
Please respond!

166
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:40,433
Mr. Mikogami, please respond!

167
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,411
Where is Alice?

168
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,246
The personality Alice
no longer exists.

169
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:55,151
Massy Spector was the activation
key for Mayumi's resurrection.

170
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,694
Alice's body is now occupied
by Mayumi.

171
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:01,797
Alice, Mayumi, Massy,
doesn't matter.

172
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,326
Where is she?

173
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:05,698
The security system
is back online.

174
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,503
Emergency. Security breach.
SC level A.

175
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,339
Activate Guard System.

176
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:14,703
Top priority,
secure President Wiseman.

177
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,972
Why do you care about that robot
so much?

178
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,287
She is my partner.

179
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,881
Ridiculous.

180
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:33,094
Alice!

181
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:53,340
Alice is dead.

182
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,382
She has become Mayumi.

183
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:57,952
Now she is Wezmar's weapon.

184
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:01,948
Alice is dead?

185
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,762
We can't leave Alice alone.

186
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:12,262
We have to locate Wezmar as soon
as we can.

187
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:16,961
But now Dyne is dead, and Alice has
disappeared without trace.

188
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:19,640
It's already been 2 weeks.

189
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,042
We've been watching the Net,
but now...

190
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:25,548
it's all up to the lmperial
Intelligence Section 6 and CIA.

191
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:39,318
Kaoru, it's Alice.

192
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:43,497
Alice is telling us
her whereabouts.

193
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:50,568
This is Alice's personal code.
There is no doubt.

194
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:53,007
Alice is alive!

195
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,414
Alive? Alice is alive?

196
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,293
My daughter...

197
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:14,220
the time has come.

198
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,433
Coordinate among
the four groups!

199
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,870
Mr. Mikogami is somewhere
in there.

200
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,005
I'm going, too.

201
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:03,372
Hey, hey.

202
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:09,346
What's this?

203
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:24,227
That experiment was a failure.

204
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,801
It was a failure.

205
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:32,371
But I spent ten years to build
back the whole thing.

206
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:34,905
Wezmar Diorg.

207
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,178
That must be Steve.

208
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,156
The rats may come scrambling,
but it's too late.

209
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:52,022
Even you are no more than a bait
to resurrect Mayumi.

210
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,567
Steve!

211
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:07,041
I arranged you to work for the
lmperial Intelligence, Kaoru Mikogami.

212
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,477
I manipulated your memory
like this.

213
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:17,477
Can you see me?

214
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,260
My love is forever.

215
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,758
Just being with you...

216
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,461
it's too much for me.

217
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:41,140
Having your around,
even just saying your name is...

218
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,977
extremely important to me.

219
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:54,451
I live by necessity.

220
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:58,324
Tonight...

221
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:00,889
I will be God.

222
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,458
For you.

223
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:15,109
Kaoru, Kaoru.

224
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,239
Please.

225
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:20,146
Please kill me.

226
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:27,820
Kill me.

227
00:19:47,344 --> 00:19:49,938
You have a reason to exist...

228
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:52,571
no more!

229
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,883
Die!

230
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:56,584
What?

231
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:03,389
Don't be stupid, Mayumi.

232
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:05,925
Are you betraying
your own father?

233
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,864
I resurrected myself
to fulfill my own wish.

234
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:15,166
Why? I spent ten years
to fulfill your wish!

235
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,305
My wish is to be
with Kaoru forever...

236
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,604
and avenge myself!

237
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:25,771
Mayumi!

238
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:45,094
So, you have come for me, Kaoru.

239
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,231
I'm so glad.

240
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:49,905
Mayumi.

241
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:54,434
Is that you, Mayumi?

242
00:20:58,248 --> 00:20:59,374
What's going?

243
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,483
We didn't make it!

244
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:04,149
Xinn is activating again.

245
00:21:04,955 --> 00:21:06,422
No.

246
00:21:08,124 --> 00:21:10,718
My name is Xinn.

247
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:14,056
I am the will of the planet Earth.

248
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:17,694
I gained consciousness through
your Network.

249
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:25,168
I wish to sign a treaty with you...

250
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:29,708
and I have prepared the
declaration and details.

251
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:36,142
What follows is a detailed and
prioritized treaty...

252
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:41,220
to be exchanged and signed
between me Xinn and human organisms.

253
00:21:41,324 --> 00:21:44,384
- Are you saying, this is Xinn?
- We still have a chance!

254
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,324
We can destroy Alice, now in the
core of Xinn.

255
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:49,226
Destroy Alice?

256
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:52,899
We got no communication.
We can't rely on the armed forces.

257
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:58,797
In that instant, my consciousness
was directly linked to the vast Network.

258
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:01,341
My body was destroyed.

259
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:04,610
But my mind was wandering
over the Net.

260
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,380
Waiting for the day to meet you.

261
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,089
Kaoru, let's go
to the realm of God.

262
00:22:14,824 --> 00:22:17,315
There, we'll be united forever.

263
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:20,988
Come on, be with me.

264
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:30,137
Come on!

265
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,500
Kaoru!

266
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:34,604
You must not! Do not get absorbed!

267
00:22:35,245 --> 00:22:37,736
Alice! Are you there?

268
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:41,643
I have made a break, taking
advantage of a territory...

269
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,453
that Alice and Mayumi cannot share.

270
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:47,683
A territory you two can't share?

271
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,250
My memory.

272
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:54,420
My memory as Alice.

273
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,669
- It is mine.
- Alice...

274
00:23:01,705 --> 00:23:05,163
Soon my personality will meld with
Mayumi's personality.

275
00:23:05,742 --> 00:23:09,371
But for now, if you kill me, you can
kill Xinn, too.

276
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:11,136
Alice...

277
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:14,648
Please kill me, Kaoru.

278
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,101
- I love you.
- I love you.

279
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:45,471
Forever and ever.

280
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,645
As long as...

281
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:51,516
pieces of me exist somewhere...

282
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,522
I will continue to love you.

283
00:23:54,657 --> 00:23:56,249
Kaoru...

284
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:00,495
I will...

285
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:03,992
continue to love...

286
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:08,663
I lost Xinn's reading.

287
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:15,703
The network is being released.

288
00:24:25,054 --> 00:24:26,954
Mr. Mikogami.

289
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,082
Alice.

290
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,361
It's the self-destruct! Retreat!

291
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:38,195
Mr. Mikogami!

292
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:45,399
- Come on!
- Idiot, let's run!

293
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:47,042
Kaoru!

294
00:24:48,578 --> 00:24:52,070
Mayumi, or Alice?
Who are you now?

295
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:55,910
It doesn't make a difference.
I'm right by your side.

296
00:25:14,437 --> 00:25:15,904
Kaoru!

297
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,647
It's been several months.

298
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:28,477
There was some confusion, but
the Xinn Phenomenon is completely gone.

299
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:32,316
Ninth Heaven has disappeared
as well.

300
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:36,320
The mysterious death of Dyne
Wiseman was not revealed to the public.

301
00:25:36,392 --> 00:25:40,624
The press reported it as an
ordinary retirement.

302
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:04,443
Maybe it was just a trick
of my eyes.

303
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:09,423
But fragments of Mayumi and
Alice's feelings must be...

304
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:15,128
still existing within the virtual
reality of Network.

305
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:21,226
After all, our feelings never die.
