1
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:08,031
Why is everywhere I
go such a lonely place?

2
00:00:08,307 --> 00:00:11,003
It all looks beautiful to me...

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,670
...but if it looks sad to you, it
must be something I don't understand.

4
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,747
People don't exist in these places.

5
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,111
You're right.

6
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:23,846
I wonder why I am trying to exist
in the world where no one exists.

7
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:29,260
I want to be in places like crowded
streets or places where everyone
smiles.

8
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:32,260
I don't know why...

9
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,559
...but these places are brought
into reality from your heart.

10
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:40,799
You mean, these lonely
places are reflecting my mind?

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,838
It's sad, isn't it?

12
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,371
I don't know.

13
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,612
But I think I'm attracted to these
places because of their sorrow...

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,914
Where should I go next?

15
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:57,513
Don't worry. I'll go wherever you go.

16
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:01,593
You're right, so I should
keep on going forward, right?

17
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,094
Yeah. Keep on going...

18
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,394
<i>One: A Glorious Season, Episode Two</i>

19
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,341
Have we met before?

20
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:17,390
Hello?

21
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,195
Hello, this is Nagamori.

22
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:21,830
Um, well...

23
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,868
Hello? Kohei?

24
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,495
Is it you, Kohei?

25
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,733
Hey Nagamori, what's up?

26
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:33,703
What do you mean "what's up?",
you're the one who called me!

27
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,377
Oh yeah?

28
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,039
Are you okay?

29
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,979
You've been acting strange
since the end of last semester.

30
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,516
Nothing is wrong with me.

31
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,480
You should talk to me if you
have something on your mind.

32
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:47,491
It's not like that...

33
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,355
I just wanted to hear your voice.

34
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,330
Don't tease me like that.

35
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,298
I'm not lying.

36
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,265
What are you up to?

37
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,271
I told you, I really wanted
to listen to your voice...

38
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:03,205
Nagamori?

39
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:03,968
Is it true?

40
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,879
About what you just said...

41
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,879
You don't trust me?

42
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:09,982
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:12,380
It just made me happy...

44
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,618
Are you eating well?

45
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:19,724
Yeah, Ms. Yuki's vacation
is coming up soon, so...

46
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:22,453
Call me when you need me, okay?

47
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:23,619
I know!

48
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,761
You sound like my mom or something.

49
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:28,489
I'm just worried about you!

50
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,698
Okay, okay!

51
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,430
Having such a trivial
conversation with Nagamori...

52
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,973
...I could feel my
frozen heart melt away.

53
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,679
But I knew that it
wasn't just a premonition.

54
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:45,575
I knew that something
horrible was about to happen...

55
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,930
Are you still waiting?

56
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,404
You aren't gonna ask me
who I am again, are you?

57
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,041
What do you want?

58
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,706
Do you think I came here to hit on you?

59
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,215
This may not be my business...

60
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:24,382
...but you'll catch a cold if you
stand out in this cold weather...

61
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,059
First of all, who are you waiting for?

62
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,662
You look so sad...

63
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,597
Sorry. I didn't need to say that...

64
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,167
But I couldn't help it
because you look sad.

65
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:43,264
This is not my business, so I'll go...

66
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,638
My childhood friend.

67
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,544
I've been waiting for
my childhood friend.

68
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:53,184
Your childhood friend?

69
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,880
This is the place we said goodbye...

70
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,858
I liked him a lot...

71
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,418
That's why I'm here, waiting for him...

72
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,854
Did you make a promise with him
that you would see each other again?

73
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,426
So, there is no point
to wait for him here.

74
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,768
That might be true...

75
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,998
But you'll still wait for him here?

76
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,678
Satomura...

77
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:40,732
Hello.

78
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,357
Hey, it's me.

79
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,262
Do you know what's tomorrow?

80
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:45,365
What?

81
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,132
I knew that you had forgotten...

82
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,036
School starts tomorrow!

83
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,173
Today is the last day
of our winter break.

84
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,269
You have to wake up
early tomorrow morning!

85
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,914
Nagamori...

86
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:57,710
Hm?

87
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:03,287
What would you do if
I suddenly disappeared?

88
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:07,585
Well, I'll talk to your aunt and get
the money back that you owe me!

89
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,452
I'm serious!

90
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,895
Well, why can't you be
serious about your future then?

91
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,499
We have to take the
entrance exams next year.

92
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,536
Forget it, it was a waste
of time to talk to you!

93
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,463
I would probably regret...

94
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,439
I would regret it a lot...

95
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,735
Nagamori...

96
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,810
Well, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

97
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,381
Don't stay up too late.

98
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,877
Good night.

99
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,119
Regrets...

100
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,792
I was really surprised!

101
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:49,296
Hey, tell me what you
know about Satomura.

102
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,069
Well, she is kinda cute...

103
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,162
I'm not asking about that...

104
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,800
Oh, I see...

105
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,575
I didn't know that
Satomura was your type.

106
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,910
Huh?

107
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:06,181
It's not going to be easy.
She is very popular, you know?

108
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:07,376
What do you mean?

109
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,884
Just what I said...

110
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:11,955
You mean she is popular among guys?

111
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:16,357
I don't know about her
personality but she looks gorgeous.

112
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,257
I wasn't...

113
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:21,862
But from what I heard, she
doesn't like men at all.

114
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:28,439
A lot of men were heart-broken by
her icy attitude and cruel words...

115
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,103
Damn it!

116
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,904
So you've been dumped
by her before too, huh?

117
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,886
What's up, Satomura?

118
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,888
Do you mind if I join you?

119
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,796
I'm done.

120
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,936
Wait a minute! You still had food left!

121
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:01,598
I'm full.

122
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,408
It's not good to leave your food.

123
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:07,635
It is said that a lot of
spirits live within rice...

124
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:10,214
...and they will cast spells
on you if you disgrace the rice.

125
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,244
My lunch was sandwiches.

126
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,617
I'm sure sandwiches
have their own spirits!

127
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:16,755
No, they don't.

128
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,287
That's cold.

129
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,163
Hey, are you going home now?

130
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:35,034
Me too.

131
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,170
So what?

132
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:41,713
What a coincidence to see you
here, so I thought I would say hi.

133
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,576
And?

134
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,179
Well, that's all I wanted to do...

135
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,249
Do you want to tell me anything else?

136
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,011
Um, no, I don't...

137
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,878
Me, neither.

138
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,419
Let's see which one is more stubborn!

139
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,604
You look like I'm bothering you.

140
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,166
You are bothering me.

141
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,774
Well I don't mind if you ignore me.

142
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,509
Oh, this waffle with red
bean sauce is spectacular!

143
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,143
That's black bean sauce.

144
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:22,280
Why you are covering your ears?

145
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,480
My brain will leak
from my ears if I don't.

146
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:31,353
My friend eats rice and wheat
noodles at the same time!

147
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,460
Not funny, huh?

148
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,898
Not at all.

149
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:39,631
Damn!

150
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,370
Hey Akane!

151
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:42,599
It's been a while!

152
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:46,242
You haven't called me in
ages, I was worried about you.

153
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,470
I'm glad that you look good!

154
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,012
Yeah.

155
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:51,745
I'll call you soon.

156
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,578
Let's go shopping
together sometime, okay?

157
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,084
Sure...

158
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,586
See ya!

159
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,015
Is she your friend?

160
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,280
Not really.

161
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:02,257
She is not my friend.

162
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:31,113
Your lunchbox looks cute.

163
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,817
This doesn't suit me, right?

164
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,550
I never said that.

165
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:39,124
Satomura, don't you think
it's a little cold out here?

166
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:40,526
No.

167
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:42,793
I'm freezing my butt here.

168
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,725
Then why don't you go
back to the classroom then?

169
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,773
You're cold too, aren't you?

170
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:51,535
Not really.

171
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:53,770
I don't think you're being honest.

172
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:55,004
You are wrong.

173
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,582
You look like you're shivering, though.

174
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,207
No, I'm not.

175
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,613
If you say so...

176
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,746
Aren't you cold?

177
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,148
No.

178
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,043
Has anybody seen Satomura?

179
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,780
No, I haven't seen her today...

180
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:36,486
That's strange, her family told me
that she's already left her house.

181
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,795
Is she...

182
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,237
Satomura, you'll catch a cold.

183
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:00,475
You should listen to
my advice sometimes.

184
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,510
You really don't need to
wait for someone like this...

185
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,109
This is my everything.

186
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,851
This is all I can do.

187
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:14,421
I was happy.

188
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:17,620
My days were simple and
nothing was exciting...

189
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,063
...but I was satisfied with
such an ordinary life...

190
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,630
...because I had my
childhood friends by my side.

191
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,369
Shiiko, him, and myself.

192
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:33,768
I thought that he was happy too.

193
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,083
I thought that it would
last forever, but...

194
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:44,554
Shiiko was the first
one to forget about him.

195
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,749
Then other classmates started
forgetting about him...

196
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:55,823
It was a rainy day like
today, he suddenly disappeared.

197
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,662
I've been waiting.

198
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,239
I've been waiting for
my childhood friend.

199
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:06,602
I couldn't do anything but wait.

200
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:13,843
After he disappeared, the memory of
him inside me started fading away...

201
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,981
But I just couldn't...

202
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:23,192
But I didn't want to
let these memories go.

203
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,963
So I tried to think
about him all the time.

204
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:32,363
I thought that he might come
back if I don't forget about him.

205
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,964
But...

206
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:38,743
Satomura!

207
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,674
Satomura, are you all right?

208
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,008
Akane!

209
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,346
I'm glad that you came back.

210
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,848
Please don't leave me...

211
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:53,785
Don't leave me alone again...

212
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,679
Orihara...

213
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,217
Call me Kohei.

214
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,020
Where am I now?

215
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,150
My aunt made phone calls
to school and your parents.

216
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:30,454
Don't worry.

217
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,757
She told them that you didn't feel well.

218
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:36,029
I'm sorry to trouble you.

219
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:38,428
When I changed your clothes...

220
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,300
Oh, don't worry, my
aunt changed you, so...

221
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:45,308
I didn't see anything.

222
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:51,747
It would be nicer if you fainted near
my house on a sunny day next time!

223
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,016
Okay.

224
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,244
I'll bring something hot to drink.

225
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,554
Uh...

226
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:00,081
Well, Kohei...

227
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,887
Thank you.

228
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,655
No problem.

229
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:14,203
It's nice and hot...

230
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,165
You'd better have a sleep
again after you drink that.

231
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,807
Hey, wait a minute!

232
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,209
Why are you giving me a look like that?

233
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,339
My aunt is downstairs.

234
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,140
Do you want me to call her up here?

235
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,308
I was just kidding.

236
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,282
You look cuter when you're smiling.

237
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,490
Don't tease me!

238
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,287
You're blushing.

239
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,554
It's because I'm having this hot drink!

240
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,529
Whatever.

241
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,167
When someone gives you a
compliment, just say thank you.

242
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,161
Come on, say it.

243
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,105
Thank you.

244
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,968
Well, I'll go downstairs and watch TV.

245
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,914
Oh, one more thing, Akane.

246
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,513
You were dumped.

247
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,186
You should forget about him.

248
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,646
Okay.

249
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,536
Wait, Akane!

250
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,668
Yes?

251
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,403
It's Saturday today.

252
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,475
Do you wanna go on a date with me?

253
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,578
I don't.

254
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,976
Come on, we once slept
in the same bed...

255
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,845
Don't say it like that,
there are other people around.

256
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,448
Besides, I just took a nap in your bed!

257
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:42,718
Let's meet at the park at 3:00 p.m.

258
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,764
I told you, no.

259
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,263
Are you sure that you
don't wanna go out with me?

260
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:51,863
Good bye.

261
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:55,037
Well, I'll be waiting for you anyway!

262
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,470
Don't worry.

263
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:04,340
If you don't show up, I'll just take
a walk around the park by myself.

264
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,719
What a beautiful day...

265
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:28,703
Can we still do things like lying down
on the grass and feeling the breeze?

266
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,638
Of course, you can.

267
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:36,441
I like looking at big clouds in the sky.

268
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:38,344
Then do it.

269
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,486
This is your journey, you
can do whatever you want.

270
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,814
But how can I do that?

271
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,216
I'm always outside of the world...

272
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,560
It may still be difficult for you...

273
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:55,029
...but I can feel the
breeze and smell the grass...

274
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,896
Teach me how to do it.

275
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,764
Okay, I'll teach you...

276
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:05,136
She goes behind my back, and
holds me with both arms.

277
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:06,801
Can you see the clouds?

278
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:07,969
Yes, I can.

279
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,104
They're moving slowly, aren't they?

280
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:12,546
Yes, they are.

281
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,648
Do you know what's moving those
clouds?

282
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:16,818
Wind.

283
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:19,081
Yes, wind.

284
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:25,125
The wind blows and moves
clouds to the end of this world.

285
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,266
I noticed the smell of grass.

286
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,335
The smell is carried by wind.

287
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,495
I can feel the breeze now.

288
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,197
Good.

289
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,774
Would you hold me for a little longer?

290
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,036
Sure.

291
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:50,416
I wanted to know her real feelings...

292
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,423
Akane, you came!

293
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,323
You wanted me to come, didn't you?

294
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,791
You wanted to come, didn't you?

295
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:06,998
I just brought you an umbrella.

296
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,807
It's a beautiful, sunny day, though.

297
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,419
My aunt is out now.

298
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,254
Really?

299
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,528
Why are you looking at me like that?

300
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:38,802
Do you think I brought you
here to do something to you?

301
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,032
I didn't say anything...

302
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,471
Where did my aunt go?

303
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:45,901
I know.

304
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:46,842
What?

305
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,780
I know that you are not a bad person.

306
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:52,515
If you say it like that,
it makes me want to do it.

307
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:53,647
What?

308
00:20:54,986 --> 00:20:56,681
I want to kiss you.

309
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,278
No...

310
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:03,956
I'm kidding!

311
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,227
What?

312
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,223
Kohei, you're so mean!

313
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,734
I'm sorry...

314
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,267
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings...

315
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,645
That was not a joke.

316
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,925
Are you okay, Akane?

317
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,169
I wouldn't do it if I didn't want to do.

318
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,553
Akane, do you feel embarrassed?

319
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,722
Yes, I do...

320
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,731
...I can't even think...

321
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,582
Oh no, don't touch it...

322
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,025
But you're already wet like this...

323
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:53,963
Oh no...

324
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,298
Turn around.

325
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,854
No, Kohei...

326
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:47,249
I feel so strange...

327
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,286
I feel so hot down there...

328
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:53,987
You look so beautiful, Akane...

329
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:05,640
Are you ready?

330
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:07,570
Yes...

331
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:10,903
Ouch!

332
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,309
Are you okay?

333
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:14,944
Please be gentle...

334
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,620
No, Kohei...

335
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,021
It hurts.

336
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:36,969
Akane!

337
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,042
Kohei!

338
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,450
I feel you, I feel you inside of me.

339
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:56,054
Kohei, I feel so good!

340
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,740
Kohei! It feels good!

341
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,008
Akane!

342
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,482
Kohei!

343
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:22,108
I'm coming...

344
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,354
Kohei...

345
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,512
I'm going to come with you!

346
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,719
What's wrong?

347
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:01,057
Nothing...

348
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:04,393
You looked so scared just now.

349
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:07,754
I had a nightmare...

350
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,462
I'm fine, as long as Akane is with me...

351
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:16,432
As long as you stay with me...

352
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,351
It rained a lot this year...

353
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,455
Kohei, are you listening?

354
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,056
What? Yeah...

355
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:37,323
How can you be so
absent-minded in the morning...

356
00:26:37,695 --> 00:26:38,889
Sorry, Nagamori...

357
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,825
Would you go ahead by yourself?

358
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,696
Wait! Kohei!

359
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,054
It's the same...

360
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:14,494
Kohei...

361
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,563
What's gotten into you?

362
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,261
Why did you start running suddenly?

363
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,197
Hey, Mizuka...

364
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,533
Is something wrong, Kohei?

365
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:32,282
You never called me by my first name...

366
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:37,713
Mizuka, will you remember
me until the last moment?

367
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:39,080
What?

368
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:42,519
No, just forget it...

369
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,420
Kohei...

370
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:14,217
