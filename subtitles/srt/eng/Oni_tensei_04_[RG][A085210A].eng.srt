1
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,483
Oh, that's good...

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,253
You're getting turned on
by being raped, aren't you?

3
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,494
You can come if you want...

4
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,929
Feel it.

5
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,089
Oh yes!

6
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,966
Flo!

7
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:00,870
Flo!

8
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:07,866
Do you have any leads?

9
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,267
How do you feel about this incident?
Do you have any leads?

10
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:11,509
How do you feel about this incident?

11
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:17,121
Twenty-two police officers were
found brutally murdered last night.

12
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:18,510
The suspect is still at large...

13
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,144
The crime scene is very chaotic...
The suspect is still at large...

14
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,147
The crime scene is very chaotic...

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,918
...with all the police vehicles.

16
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,828
Many believe that some large
underground organization is involved...

17
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:30,366
The case seems to be a direct
challenge to law enforcement...

18
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,630
The Tokyo Police Department is
putting every available man on this case.

19
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,921
Flo!

20
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:28,652
Since that day, the ogre on
Nozomi': back never rose again.

21
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,727
He didn't seek blood...

22
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,529
...nor put her in the pain
of shameful pleasure.

23
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:42,797
Nozomi's mind was
locked in the darkness...

24
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:45,499
...with the evil mind of the ogre.

25
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,046
The Nozomi I once knew
would not come back to me.

26
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:01,787
The suspect is an 18 year-old girl.

27
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:06,624
Are you saying that the girl
killed 22 policemen by herself?

28
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:07,930
Yes, she did!

29
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,028
But, there are no witnesses...

30
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,529
I saw it!

31
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,093
I see...

32
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,968
Okay then.

33
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:18,267
Well, you take a rest.

34
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,079
Doctor, please take care of her.

35
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:24,176
Y-Yes...

36
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,643
She still seems to be
in some sort of shock.

37
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,380
Well, she just had a
miscarriage, I wouldn't blame her.

38
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:37,894
The police have pride.

39
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,924
Including you, the
victims are all policemen.

40
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,366
They won't rest until
the case is closed.

41
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:48,765
<i>So</i> don't worry, and
get some rest for a while.

42
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,731
It's doctor's orders, now.

43
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,539
They raped me...

44
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,209
...and took my baby away.

45
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,278
How can I rest?

46
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,685
What are you talking about,
were you going to have the baby?

47
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,082
You don't even know who the father was!

48
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:08,083
I'm sorry, I said too much.

49
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:09,150
But...

50
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,194
I know the father.

51
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,997
Nozomi Ema.

52
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:15,088
What?

53
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,929
I was raped by the ogre on her back.

54
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:23,831
And I became pregnant...

55
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,271
Wait...

56
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:29,141
Are you talking about
the tattoo on her back?

57
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,475
It's the truth.

58
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,944
The tattoo would come to life and
come out of her back, running rampant.

59
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,122
And Nozomi is not the only
one who has a living tattoo.

60
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:46,019
But just like the other cases,
the police will never catch the suspect...

61
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,294
...because everybody believes
that it is some yakuza gang.

62
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,932
What are you talking about,
have you gone mad?

63
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:53,196
Stop the car!

64
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,801
H-Hey, calm down!

65
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,311
Do you really expect
me to believe that?

66
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,603
Nobody will believe you!

67
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:04,145
Hey, you!

68
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:09,645
Excuse me.

69
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,611
When did she come here?

70
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,815
I guess it was about two
o'clock, but you were asleep.

71
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:19,896
She came to the reception
desk and left those for you...

72
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,897
As I just returned from hell...

73
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,732
I guess you still can't
put it out of your mind.

74
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,500
It's been ten years...

75
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:32,734
Kure...

76
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,245
Flo!

77
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,227
Flo!

78
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,015
Hey, lick it!

79
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:17,779
I'm telling you to lick it all up!

80
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,854
Hey, hey...

81
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,577
What the fuck did you do to him?

82
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,851
They were hospitalized for three months.

83
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:58,320
Without Mr. Enokido's intervention, it
wouldn't have been a simple self-defense case.

84
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:04,661
After all that, you're just going to
quit and go back to being a murderer?

85
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,270
I'm sorry...

86
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:09,472
...but I've already decided.

87
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,278
Nozomi?

88
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:17,877
What's wrong?

89
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:19,211
Are you okay?

90
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,882
Water...

91
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,676
Give me water...

92
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,752
Water...

93
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,585
Be careful.

94
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:32,926
Water...

95
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,528
Give me some water.

96
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,189
Yes, more, lick me more...

97
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,563
Oh good...

98
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,533
Stir harder!

99
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,402
Good, good!

100
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,904
Shimon, give me your dick, please?

101
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,110
Stick it into me as hard as you can.

102
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,785
Please, hurry and fuck me.

103
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,555
Here, yes, until it won't go further...

104
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,647
She's the detective from the other day.

105
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,815
What should we do?

106
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,546
Let's kill her.

107
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,846
Don't disturb me now,
I'm coming soon...

108
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:06,486
Oh good...

109
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,419
Yes, I'm coming!

110
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:11,389
Yes !

111
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,325
Yes !

112
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,197
W-What?

113
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,201
Long time no see.

114
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,242
Did you come here to
catch me by yourself?

115
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:30,678
Or...

116
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,553
...is it that you can't
forget about my taste...

117
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:42,923
Stupid bitch!

118
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:47,828
The police, no, even
the army can't catch me!

119
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,735
I have a guardian
angel that Horioni gave me.

120
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:59,040
You mean that
disgusting tattoo of yours?

121
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,050
I'm gonna kill you!

122
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:13,855
I'll give a slow and painful death to
anyone who makes fun of my tattoo!

123
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,790
I'll cover you with shit and dump
you in front of the police station!

124
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,962
No, that's not good enough...

125
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:28,597
I'll make you suffer before I kill you.

126
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,774
Where is the girl who was
with you the other day?

127
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,609
What are you going to do to her?

128
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,844
Answer me.

129
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,339
Where is she?

130
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,381
I'll never tell you!

131
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,788
I'll make you tell me...

132
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,958
Where should I start?

133
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:52,919
Take a look at this.

134
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:56,426
It was inside of her pocket.

135
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,636
It's a church in
Nakano, I know where it is.

136
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,803
You seem very happy here.

137
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,074
Is she your bitch?

138
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,942
That's not your business!

139
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,307
<i>So</i> it's true!

140
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:11,873
You are the worst!

141
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,548
Maybe we should all go pray.

142
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:18,182
Please, forgive us sinful souls...

143
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:20,820
Mr. Enokido...

144
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,318
Thank you for coming.

145
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,995
What are you doing,
you haven't recovered yet.

146
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,593
Please, help me look for Kure.

147
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,662
She is going to kill the suspect.

148
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:32,561
What?

149
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:37,273
She left her resignation,
but she still has a gun.

150
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,176
I have to stop her before
she does something stupid...

151
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,710
I came to talk about the case.

152
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,006
What about it?

153
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,476
I did autopsies on the bodies.

154
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,513
The policemen were not attacked.

155
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:53,213
They killed each other.

156
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,281
What?

157
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:00,686
The bullets from the policemen':
bodies were New Nanbu .38 caliber.

158
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,524
One policeman': skin was stuck
under another policeman': fingertip.

159
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,928
It's a sign of a struggle.

160
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,436
Are you sure?

161
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,166
Not only that...

162
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:15,410
The semen sample I took
after Ms. Kure was raped...

163
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:20,579
The test results show it's from several
different policemen at the scene.

164
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,543
Kure didn't say anything about that.

165
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,149
She was probably tricked too.

166
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,824
Who are you?

167
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:38,797
What are you doing?

168
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,971
Good evening, sister.

169
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,164
Reiko?

170
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,867
Yasuko, run away!

171
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:51,714
Can a person who serves God
forsake her friend and run away?

172
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,816
I'll be enjoying you...

173
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,750
...all night!

174
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,360
Mass hypnotism?

175
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,597
Yes, are you familiar with
the running water effect?

176
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,459
It's often used for copperplate prints.

177
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,602
When you stare at a striped
pattern, you get dizzy, right?

178
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:22,171
If those patterns are combined,
it will look like a moving picture.

179
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,612
Doctor, please get to the point.

180
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:31,584
Ms. Kure said that the tattoo on the
suspect': back jumped out and raped her.

181
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,282
Of course, that can't happen.

182
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:40,889
If she saw some kind of
hallucination, then it all makes sense.

183
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:42,961
Doesn't it?

184
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,528
The tattoo artist who
gives life to his tattoos...

185
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,002
Horioni!

186
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:51,604
Yasuko, run away!

187
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:52,503
Hurry!

188
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,106
Please, run!

189
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,987
Don't worry about me, just go!

190
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:06,849
Yasuko!

191
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,033
No, don't!

192
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,402
No...

193
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,179
slop it!

194
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,046
It effects not only vision...

195
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:36,552
...but also hearing and smell,
as well as the other senses...

196
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,923
And it made her see the tattoo
come to life from the girl's back.

197
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:44,017
The policemen were
probably hallucinating too...

198
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,392
And they thought they
were killing the criminals.

199
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,129
Please, stop!

200
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,568
That's terrible...

201
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:59,837
You may be right.

202
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,274
It makes sense, but...

203
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,408
...there's no proof.

204
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,178
There is.

205
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:07,540
What?

206
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:10,150
That case with the gangsters...

207
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,086
it was the same situation as this case.

208
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,654
And that girl was the
only the person alive.

209
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,561
Nozomi Ema!

210
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,365
She's probably at the church right now.

211
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,602
Please stop it!

212
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:33,901
Let her go!

213
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,410
I'm begging you, please let Yasuko go!

214
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,511
Please leave me alone...

215
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,886
I can't...

216
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:19,819
No way.

217
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:25,524
We're gonna fuck you until
your pussy becomes useless.

218
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,097
If you wanna blame
somebody, blame her.

219
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:30,262
Water...

220
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:34,366
Water...

221
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,171
Water...

222
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,371
Give me water.

223
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:44,680
Nozomi, don't come!

224
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:45,641
Flo!

225
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:52,783
Look at the poor girl,
what happened to you?

226
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,150
I fucked you <i>so</i> hard
that you went mad, huh?

227
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,152
But a more horrible
tragedy is about to happen!

228
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,557
Stop it, leave Nozomi alone!

229
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:08,194
Do you think you are in a
position to ask for anything?

230
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:10,538
Nozomi...

231
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,298
Shut up!

232
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:26,912
What is that?

233
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,586
Don't you feel anything?

234
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,089
That's no fun.

235
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,226
You did this to her.

236
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,696
Nozomi...

237
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,925
Are you really a human being?

238
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:39,829
If I can have fun, I don't
care about anything else.

239
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,704
The whole universe
revolves around me!

240
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,205
I'll kill you!

241
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,708
Are those a detective': words?

242
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:52,513
I guess I'll have to keep
fucking her until she feels good.

243
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:05,691
Nozomi...

244
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,774
Not yet, I'll do it more and more!

245
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,752
You really don't feel anything...

246
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,124
I wish you could enjoy this pleasure too.

247
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,870
Well it's time to say goodbye...

248
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,866
No, what are you doing?

249
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:55,140
Don't kill her!

250
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:56,572
Nozomi!

251
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:57,744
Nozomi!

252
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,012
Goodbye, Nozomi...

253
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,675
Don't...

254
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,781
Please stop it!

255
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,124
Nozomi!

256
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,946
N-Nozomi?

257
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,588
Don't just stand there, kill her now!

258
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:53,631
Ogre...

259
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,670
It's the ogre!

260
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,311
No, it can't be...

261
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,558
No, what are you doing?

262
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,720
Flo!

263
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:30,702
Slop it!

264
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,270
NO, stop!

265
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,978
Stop it, please!

266
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:42,108
You're a detective, stop her!

267
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,615
I'm sorry, but...

268
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,479
...I'm not a detective anymore.

269
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:52,056
I guess the universe
doesn't revolve around you!

270
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,497
N-No, help me!

271
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,399
No, don't!

272
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,839
Feels good?

273
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,007
W-What?

274
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,813
You don't need to hide.

275
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,078
You're already <i>so</i> wet...

276
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,712
That hurts!

277
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:20,950
No, it won't go in any deeper!

278
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,221
Slop!

279
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,688
Flo!

280
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,224
Hear this?

281
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,128
Dirty sound...

282
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,875
I won't forgive you...

283
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,172
But...

284
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,379
...I'll let you come one
last time before you die.

285
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:09,935
Come!

286
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,107
Come!

287
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,202
I'm coming, I'm coming!

288
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,427
Goodbye...

289
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,170
Let us through!

290
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:49,570
This way!

291
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:50,938
Excuse us.

292
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,245
I'll go check the back door,
please take care <i>of</i> things here.

293
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:55,944
Let's go.

294
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,847
Reiko kept her promise with me.

295
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:05,557
The promise that
she'd never try to kill anyone...

296
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:09,328
...and that she'd take care of herself...

297
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:14,532
Then she disappeared with Nozomi Ema.

298
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,901
Aren't you going to look for her?

299
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,532
I'm not that insensitive.

300
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:22,842
Go look for her if you want.

301
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,971
I'm not saying that...

302
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,441
I just want to know the
truth behind the tattoo.

303
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:33,221
Everybody has a demon inside.

304
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:39,491
We all try to control it
with the power of reason, don't we?

305
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:40,889
That's true...

306
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,358
it's likely that the girl's
suppressed emotions...

307
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:50,133
...erupted because of that tattoo.

308
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:51,837
Probably...

309
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,900
You would make a good psychiatrist.

310
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,543
Stop it, I'm just a
run-of-the-mill detective...

311
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,850
Please, give it me...

312
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,554
I know it's just a momentary pleasure.

313
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:20,766
I know this ogre's horn that connects
our relationship may be only an illusion.

314
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,404
I love you, Nozomi.

315
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,304
I'm coming!

316
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:26,807
But even so...

317
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,665
Please fill me up with your come!

318
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,133
...we'll still look for Horioni.
Please fill me up with your come!

319
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,579
...we'll still look for Horioni.

320
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:31,578
I'm coming!

321
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,381
I have no regrets.

322
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:37,675
We finally have our freedom.

323
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:45,222
Now that we're complete,
we could fly up into the sky...

324
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:50,059
...just like the painted dragon when it
came to life with the last stroke of the brush.
