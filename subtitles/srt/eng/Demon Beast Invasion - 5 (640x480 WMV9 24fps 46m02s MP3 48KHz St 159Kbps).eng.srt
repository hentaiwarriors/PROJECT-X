00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,100
Hong Kong — 1994

2
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,420
Stop! You won't get away!

3
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,720
Mei Ling!

4
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,350
Hoei, save yourself!

5
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,390
Stop that, Mei Ling!
It's just a little further!

6
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
Hoei!

7
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,950
We've come this far.

8
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,290
We're going to Hong Kong,
to FREEDOM... Together.

9
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,870
Hoei...

10
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,000
Mother... Mother!

11
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,300
Demon Beast Invasion
episode 5
Hong Kong Resurrection

12
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,260
And the green rain which
moved into the...

13
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,930
...Hong Kong-Macao area
from southern China...

14
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,770
...continues to mystify
the people living there.

15
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,520
One morning after the incident,
the strangely colored rain had...

16
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,070
...vanished with no lasting
effect on anyone caught in it.

17
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,820
Authorities continue to
look for some explanation.

18
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,780
In any case, that high pressure
front off the continent...

19
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,830
...should be giving Japan
clear weather for a while.

20
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,790
Ow!

21
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,840
Muneto!

22
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,460
Kayo!

23
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,130
Morning. Why so glum
this early in the morning?

24
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,100
Take a look at this.
This scratch.

25
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,470
What's that from?

26
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,480
Don't tell me you attacked
some girl and she fought back!

27
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,480
Well, maybe I'm looking for
someone different for a change.

28
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,110
What?! You mean you did?!
You tried to rape someone?!

29
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,280
A guy who serves a religion
and does that goes to hell.

30
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,450
But your temple's been breaking
those rules for generations.

31
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,370
Kayo! What if one of the
temple families heard that?!

32
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,000
You're the only one
who's supposed to know!

33
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,500
But you didn't try to...?

34
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,170
Of course not!

35
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,380
Then why the scratch?

36
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,840
Dad was demonstrating
some kempo for me.

37
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,850
- Is that like karate?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,180
They say the Ungyosai
monks have been passing down...

39
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,100
...Chinese Hokuba kempo for
the last 4,000 years.

40
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,150
So...

41
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:11,400
Dad just suddenly decided it
was time to pass it on to me!

42
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,450
Too bad.

43
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,200
God, I hate the thought of
spending the holidays training.

44
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,830
If I could find some
excuse to get out of it...

45
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,920
Kayo!

46
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,460
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing, just...

47
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,880
I'll carry you. Come on.

48
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,840
It's okay.
I just need to rest.

49
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,510
It's no trouble, really.

50
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,510
Don't worry, Muneto.
Just go on ahead.

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,680
It's...
You know, a girl thing.

52
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,850
Well, but...

53
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,190
Really. I'll be fine if I
just rest a little in here.

54
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,190
Don't take too long
or I'll come back.

55
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,950
Thanks.

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,250
What's wrong with me?
At a time like this?

57
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,260
Mother!

58
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,900
Mother! Give it to me!
Give me your warm wetness!

59
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,950
Fingers...
Can't control myself...!

60
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,950
Why? What's happening?

61
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,950
I thought the Demon Beast
was finally dead!

62
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,580
Mother! Mother!

63
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,630
Please don't forget the feel
of my rough tongue over you!

64
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,720
Muneto...

65
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,640
I don't want you
to see me like this!

66
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,990
Kayo! Kayo!

67
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,740
Kayo!

68
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,290
Kayo!

69
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,960
What happened?

70
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,130
Muneto... Muneto!

71
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,600
I know. I know.

72
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,140
Don't think about it.
Don't remember! Okay?

73
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,020
It's Chuan Zui Ji.

74
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,320
Chuan Zui Ji?

75
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,650
The ancient Chinese
name for it.

76
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,280
The hidden intuition
of the heart.

77
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,330
The doorway to the soul.

78
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,040
Deep behind the door
to her memories...

79
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,710
...Kayo fears the
Demon Beast's resurrection.

80
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,630
You mean the memories Kayo
still carries of the Demon Beast?

81
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,670
I'm afraid they
may be unconsciously...

82
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,760
...opening the door
to her Chuan Zui Ji.

83
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,630
Kayo's body isn't like
that of normal girls.

84
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,340
She is doomed to attract
the Demon Beast.

85
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,850
Her feelings as the Beast's
mother are at war...

86
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,020
...with the good side
of her human heart.

87
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,690
Dad, I really don't understand
what you're saying.

88
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,690
But I can't stand it that
we thought the Demon Beast...

89
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,690
...was gone for good, but now
its memory will keep on...

90
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,530
...coming back to haunt
us in Kayo's body!

91
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,030
You must redirect the power
of her Chuan Zui Ji properly.

92
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,370
Do that, and Kayo will be saved.

93
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,700
- And how do I do that?!
- That I do not know.

94
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,160
It exists deep
within the heart.

95
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,750
Even Maitreya can't
help with this one.

96
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,000
Muneto, wait!
You damned fool!

97
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,460
Shut up, you
degenerate monk!

98
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,630
You...

99
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,600
Is the Demon Beast
influencing him?

100
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,060
Kayo, too,
is cursed greatly.

101
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:19,150
Namu Amida Butsu...
Namu Amida Butsu...

102
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,800
What the...?

103
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,140
- Get a good shot!
- Her? Are you kidding?

104
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,980
Okay, smile!

105
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,870
Hey, what's with you?
Come on, take it!

106
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,160
Yeah, come on!
Snap it! Snap it!

107
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,750
Right...

108
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,970
What is this?

109
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,800
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

110
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,990
This is the best place to play
hard and forget about it.

111
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,500
But roller coasters go too fast.
I can't stand them!

112
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,580
Then why don't we
ride one by ourselves?

113
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,550
Best place I know to have some
real fun without anyone knowing.

114
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,180
No way, pal! I'm definitely
not in the mood today!

115
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,550
What's with you now?

116
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,890
Come on, it's the best way to
forget about everything, right?

117
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,810
But...

118
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,230
Come on, I don't think
I can stand it anymore.

119
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,730
You shouldn't think girls
are like guys that way!

120
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,530
- Kayo, you do...?
- Yes, I love you.

121
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,700
So if we wait till the time's
right, it'll be better.

122
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,250
Maybe that would be a
better place to do it.

123
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,580
What, you...?! Muneto!

124
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,250
Don't tell me you wanted to
do it in the temple of Kannon?!

125
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,880
Shame! Shame, Muneto!
You'll go to hell for that!

126
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,550
Must run in the family.

127
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,930
Enough of THAT talk!

128
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
Come on, come on!

129
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,940
Tickets! Ticketsl

130
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:11,570
Congratulations! You're Akaori
Land's one millionth customers!

131
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,620
You win a trip for two
to Hong Kong and Macao!

132
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,370
No way! Really?!

133
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,960
No lies.
Here's your proof.

134
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,210
We are gonna have one
hell of a holiday!

135
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,470
- But I don't have a passport...
- It won't take long!

136
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,970
Good for you! Good for you!
Congratulations!

137
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,970
Thanks! Thanks a lot!

138
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:59,290
Our guardian spirit Tairunto
is growing well in Saijan.

139
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,670
The 800-year wish of the
Triads is about to be granted.

140
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,670
You can say that again!

141
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,680
We're grateful to help
Tairunto to be reborn.

142
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,640
By the way, do we have
Tairunto's mother yet?

143
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,440
We have her, all right.
We're preparing to bring her.

144
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,190
But we needn't worry about
allowing the heaven-sent...

145
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,940
...dragon children
to grow to maturity.

146
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,610
We just have to protect
Tairunto at all costs.

147
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:41,200
Exactly. Tairunto's resurrection
is our top priority.

148
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,710
I agree.

149
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,710
What about Tairunto's
personal guard?

150
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,170
The bandits on the river and
Triad troops defend him.

151
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,670
Until his rebirth, no one
must know about him.

152
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,680
Why don't we cut off the
business talk for this...

153
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,060
...evening and get
to the entertainment?

154
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,040
To the everlasting
prosperity of the Triads!

155
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,080
Cheers!

156
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,550
This is G7. As I suspected,
the Demon Beast has begun...

157
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,970
...its resurrection in
the Hong Kong-Macao area.

158
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,480
The Hong Kong gangster Triads
are already its carriers.

159
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,440
Get a termination team in here.
I'll look for the main body.

160
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,480
They're luring her to Hong Kong.

161
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,280
If they're going after Kayo,
they'll also go after...

162
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,160
Muneto!

163
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,170
Oh, it's so pretty!
Muneto, look at this!

164
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,800
Seeing this really
gets me in the mood!

165
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,850
Let's have some REAL
fun tonight, huh? Huh?

166
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,180
Stop it! Don't you ever
think about anything else?

167
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,520
Aw, come on...

168
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,860
It's fun feeling like we're
going someplace exotic.

169
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,860
You're feeling better now,
aren't you, Kayo?

170
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,530
Relaxed?

171
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,890
Hold it. I just came
to deal with you.

172
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,560
I've got a pass from the
Taipans in Hong Kong.

173
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,360
I want to buy what you're
smuggling. The drugs, too.

174
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,200
Trust me! I won't be paying
in Hong Kong dollars.

175
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,580
I'm talking U.S. greenbacks.
Gold ingots, if you want.

176
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,200
What are you really after?

177
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,870
I hear you pirates have some
real bad asses with you.

178
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,330
I want to hire the
Khmer Rouge.

179
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,250
I want to kill a woman
leading them.

180
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,260
The Taipans in Hong Kong will
pay double for what you've got.

181
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,260
Triple, even.

182
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,100
- Who are you after?
- I can't say. Not now.

183
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,600
I'll tell you once I confirm
my target. Nothing till then!

184
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,110
What's so damn funny?

185
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,110
The thing you want to
kill... Is this!

186
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,090
Shit!

187
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,810
He's getting away!

188
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,990
So, the Demon Beast has
control of them already.

189
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,640
Great, now I've lost Kayo...

190
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,680
For crying out loud!

191
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,480
My luck sucks...

192
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,700
Hey! What's wrong?
You okay?

193
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,360
She's burning up!

194
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,370
Mei Ling...
I'll meet you in Hong Kong.

195
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,000
Hoei?

196
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,040
If we stay together, the
river bandits will get us.

197
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,040
I'll lead them off,
and you...

198
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,670
No! Don't leave me!

199
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,760
Mei Ling...

200
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,050
Why do you think
we crossed the border?!

201
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,850
As long as you stay alive, I can
give you the future I promised.

202
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,850
Hoei...

203
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,730
Get to my uncle's junk
in Aberdeen Harbor.

204
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,400
I'll do whatever it takes
to get back to you.

205
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,690
Hoei...

206
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,440
There they are? Move it!

207
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,740
Now get going!

208
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,790
If you hide in this fog, you
can make it to the river's mouth.

209
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,410
Hoei...

210
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,210
Mei Ling...

211
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,600
Hey, are you OK?

212
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,940
Hoei, don't go...

213
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,060
H..Hey...

214
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,110
Even if can't escape to Hong Kong,
I wanna be with you, hold me.

215
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,950
What am I thinking at a time like this?

216
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,500
Are you illegal immigrants?

217
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,290
Don't be ridiculous.

218
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,750
I'm a tourist.
I have my Japanese passport here.

219
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,290
She's with me.

220
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,920
Now quit spoiling the mood!

221
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,930
Do it too much and it'll
start to hurt, kid.

222
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,930
If we stay out here,
she really will get arrested.

223
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,530
Hi. You're awake now.

224
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,540
Who are you?

225
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,500
Relax. Relax. You had a
fever, but it's gone down.

226
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,500
You just need some food.
Oh, and medicine, too.

227
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,340
I don't think you'll
need a doctor, though.

228
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,180
We can leave the
complicated part for later.

229
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,850
The hotel front doesn't seem
to mind you're an illegal.

230
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,430
Thank you.

231
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,850
My name's Muneto.
What's yours?

232
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,860
Mei Ling.

233
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,900
I like it. Anyway, eat.

234
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,240
I got a dress for you, too.
Nothing fancy, I'm afraid.

235
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,870
I have to meet someone.
Wait here.

236
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,580
I've got a few things to take
care of. Bye, I'll be back.

237
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:09,800
Kayo!

238
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,210
Muneto!

239
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,550
Good. I was worried when
I found you weren't back here.

240
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,220
I was about to go out
looking for you again.

241
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,560
I figured you'd probably
be waiting for me here.

242
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,230
Let's go in. Hong Kong's gotta
be the sweatiest place on Earth!

243
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,900
Yeah. I want to get
in the shower fast!

244
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,520
- So would I. With you.
- Stop that!

245
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,240
Wish we had an air
conditioner in here.

246
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,290
You'd think they'd book a better
hotel for their millionth customers.

247
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,080
Oh, I think I like these places
better than the fancy hotels.

248
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,250
Really?

249
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,260
Really. This is way more
exotic than a luxury hotel.

250
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,300
And I like to go out for food.

251
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,940
What's wrong with me?!
Kayo's right here!

252
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,660
Why...?

253
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,630
Why?!

254
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,140
Shit...

255
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,970
Just a little further...

256
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,970
Muneto!

257
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,640
What are you doing?

258
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,980
Oh, er, uh... Just checking
for an emergency exit.

259
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,980
In case there was a fire or
an earthquake or something.

260
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,700
Looks okay. If anything happens,
we can make it to the fire escape.

261
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,530
Muneto...

262
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,700
Look.

263
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,340
Kayo... You're beautiful.

264
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,050
Thank you. I bought it
cheap at a little stand.

265
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,340
It wasn't even the one
I liked best.

266
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,350
Well, it's a little low cut.
But it looks good on you.

267
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,850
Really. Great.

268
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,730
Come on.

269
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,360
No teasing today.

270
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,030
You mean it?!

271
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:43,070
Just like you're the only
guy for me, tonight I'm yours...

272
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,540
I'm glad we came to Hong Kong!

273
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,710
So don't go peeping
at the room next door.

274
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,080
Oh, uh... You saw I
was sorta curious, huh?

275
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,380
I just want you to
be curious about me.

276
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,720
Kayo!

277
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,720
No, gehtly.
No need to rush...

278
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,590
Muneto...

279
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,170
Muneto?

280
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,630
What the hell was that?

281
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,220
Muneto?

282
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,430
Just let me check it out.

283
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,810
What, now?!

284
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,520
Just wait for me. Okay?

285
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,490
What the hell?!

286
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,200
Came looking for you and
picked up this Beast larva.

287
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,780
Who are you?

288
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,370
Interplanetary Mutual Observation
agent. Code name: G7.

289
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,040
And what's an I MO
agent doing here?!

290
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,540
The Demon Beast.
This girl was infested.

291
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,550
Mei Ling...

292
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,510
Look. These things
aren't very strong.

293
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,390
But they can control any
man or woman they get into!

294
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,560
Wait a minute!

295
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:23,530
Muneto, if you're an agent, then
you know what this leads to.

296
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,030
It's a precursor to the
Demon Beast's resurrection?

297
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,030
The green rain fell here.

298
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,370
Yeah... I heard
about it on the news.

299
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,000
The Demon Beast's spirit
fell along with the rain.

300
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,670
What?!

301
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:45,550
They've taken control of the
river bandits and the Triads.

302
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,010
They're working to bring their
new king completely back to life.

303
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,680
It's being reborn?!

304
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,720
Japan is sealed off to it.

305
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,390
It's trying to succeed here
where it failed before!

306
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,690
Move aside. She may be
innocent, but if I let her go...

307
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,690
...she may give birth to
two or three more!

308
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,360
- I won't let you!
- Muneto!

309
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,570
Mei Ling can't die yet!

310
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,070
There's someone she loves
that she has to see first!

311
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,080
- Muneto!
- It's not your decision!

312
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,080
If you barbecued everyone
who's carried a Demon Beast...

313
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,710
...you'd have
to kill Kayo, too!

314
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,750
You're right. I'll have to
take care of her, too...

315
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,760
...before the Beast
can get her.

316
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,380
Like hell you will!
You son of a bitch!

317
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,350
It was your own mistake to let
it lure you out of the sealed zone.

318
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,180
Lure me out?

319
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,390
You still don't get it?!
Idiot!

320
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,100
You mean that millionth
customer thing?

321
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,030
All a plan carried out
by the Beast's minions.

322
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,570
Kayo!

323
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,620
Muneto, help me!

324
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,910
Kayo!

325
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,260
Kayo!

326
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,560
Muneto, the Flame Buster!
Toast these fuckers!

327
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:32,990
Hoei?!

328
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,620
What?!

329
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,840
- Kayo!
- Wait!

330
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,300
KAYO!!!

331
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,510
Shit!

332
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,600
I screwed up. Didn't think those
bandits would come this far.

333
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,610
What about Kayo?!
Where are they taking her?

334
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,610
Up the river. I've been picking
up an incredibly strong...

335
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,610
...Demon Beast life reading deep in
the jungles up the main tributary.

336
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,620
It's the Demon Beast king.

337
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,200
What?! What if it manages
to join with Kayo?

338
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,290
Then the Demon Beast
will definitely be reborn.

339
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,660
What?!

340
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,290
Mei Ling, who was that guy?

341
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,630
His eyes, his face...
They seemed different.

342
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:35,010
But he reacted to my voice.
It had to have been...

343
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,930
Been my Hoei!

344
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,720
He's already been taken
over by the Demon Beast.

345
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,680
Demon Beast?

346
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,900
Yeah. He doesn't have any memories
or even his human soul anymore.

347
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,650
Cut it out, G7!

348
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,400
- It's the truth!
- I said cut it out!

349
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,700
We don't have time for this.
Let's get ourselves upriver.

350
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,920
The boat's sensors are
set to Demon Beast readings.

351
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,590
When you put this
on your back...

352
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,680
...make sure you kill
the king Demon Beast.

353
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,720
Otherwise you'll burn
right along with it.

354
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,770
Yeah. Gotcha.

355
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,940
The real problem is getting
to that thing in one piece.

356
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,980
The river bandits?

357
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,530
Yeah. They're a bunch of
cutthroats who have controlled...

358
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,030
...this lawless area for
the past 800 years.

359
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,660
Now that they're under the
Demon Beast's control...

360
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,700
...they'll be even tougher.

361
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,120
What about some
support from the I MO?

362
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,040
They've got a team taking care of
the Triads in Hong Kong and Macao.

363
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,260
They have to nail every last
Demon Beast carrier.

364
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,760
You were going to face the thing
alone as it was being reborn?!

365
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,470
Well, now there's two of us.
You and me, Muneto.

366
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,970
I'm so happy I could cry.

367
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,060
But I'll tell
you this just once.

368
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,070
Don't point that nozzle
at Kayo or Mei Ling...

369
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,780
The minute you do,
I'll kill you!

370
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,460
Stopping the Demon Beast from
being reborn is my top priority.

371
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,750
And I'll do whatever
it takes to ensure that!

372
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,340
You son of a bitch!

373
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,130
Stop it!

374
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,970
This boyfriend of yours, Hoei...

375
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,470
He's Khmer Rouge. One of the
best fighters the bandits have.

376
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,060
The lady in charge said
I was to try and...

377
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,810
...recruit him to help
fight the Demon Beast.

378
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,480
Now he could be our
trickiest enemy.

379
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:00,110
But, when he turned towards me,
I saw Hoei's eyes...

380
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,120
...and there was a flash
of his memory of me in them!

381
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,410
Mei Ling...

382
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,790
Maybe his mind and body
are being controlled...

383
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,000
...but deep in his eyes
were his memories of me!

384
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,250
Chuan Zui Ji...

385
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,000
Chuan Zui Ji?

386
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:21,130
The memories Hoei and I
share that can't be replaced.

387
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,510
The door to his heart
isn't shut completely.

388
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,430
Chuan Zui Ji.

389
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,770
You must direct this
power of the heart properly.

390
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,690
Do that, and Kayo will be free!

391
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,190
Mei Ling...

392
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,200
Muneto, when you saved me
I knew in my heart that...

393
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,490
...I'd be able to
see my Hoei again.

394
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,910
That, too, was Chuan Zui Ji.

395
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,080
And now I'm on my way
to see Hoei again.

396
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,090
And I know in my heart
I can call back to him...

397
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,840
...the wonderful memory of
when we made love together.

398
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,760
Is that Chuan Zui Ji, too?

399
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,850
That's why, Muneto...

400
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:10,100
You have to believe your love's
memories aren't gone for good.

401
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,600
Yeah. I understand, Mei Ling.

402
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,900
Okay, we got company!

403
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,360
We're going in!

404
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,600
Mother...

405
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,650
No... Stop it!
Muneto...

406
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,620
Ah, Mother...
Source of my life!

407
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:16,290
So glad... So delicious...
Thank you, Mother!

408
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,970
New lord emperor of
the river... Protect us!

409
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:39,650
Submit to me! With Mother's
power, I shall be reborn!

410
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,070
Muneto, save me!
Save me...

411
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:53,580
Mother, as long as you're with me,
you've nothing to fear.

412
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,000
We can do it anytime, Mother!

413
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,590
Mother!

414
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,850
Here they come!

415
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,690
Get everyone guns!

416
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,270
Hoei!

417
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,350
Kayo!

418
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,900
Muneto!

419
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,070
Watch your back, Muneto!

420
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,110
Go to hell!

421
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,170
Mei Ling!

422
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,300
Hoei!

423
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,600
Mother...

424
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,790
Hang on!

425
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,120
It's no use! Save yourselves!

426
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,040
No! Don't let go!

427
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,090
Mei Ling! Don't give up!

428
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,590
What about your and
Hoei's Chuan Zui Ji?

429
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,340
Muneto... But, I can't...

430
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,310
Muneto!

431
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,770
Why, you...! What are you
doing to Tairunto's mother?!

432
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,480
Hoei, stop it! Stop it, Hoei!

433
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,190
Are you talking to me?

434
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,700
Yes! It's me, Mei Ling!

435
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,700
Mei Ling?

436
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,870
Don't you... Don't you
know who I am? Hoei!

437
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,210
Hoei...? Mei Ling...?

438
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,520
MUNETO!

439
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,160
Mother!

440
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,870
Damn you, Mother!

441
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,160
Muneto, help me!

442
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,370
Kayo!

443
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,920
- Hold it!
- No, don't!

444
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,500
Hoei, he's my friend.

445
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,720
He allowed me to be
with you once more!

446
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,850
Muneto, save yourself!

447
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,760
I can't do that!
We're leaving together!

448
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,230
Mei Ling, save yourself!

449
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:52,230
No! I want you
to come with me! Hoei!

450
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,240
Mei Ling...

451
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,760
Mei... Ling...?

452
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,680
You remember,
don't you, Hoei?

453
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,270
Mei Ling!

454
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,890
Hoei...

455
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,230
Make love to me, one more time.
Like you did before.

456
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,270
Mei Ling!

457
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,950
Kayo, they've become one.

458
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,500
Muneto?

459
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,410
We have to become
one like they have.

460
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,290
Do you remember?
The ecstasy we felt when...

461
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,380
...we first defeated
the Demon Beast?

462
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,380
It remains within us.
That ultimate power.

463
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,650
Mother!
I'll never let you go!

464
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,330
Muneto!

465
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,680
Hoei!

466
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,010
I'll never let
you go, Mei Ling.

467
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,020
Kayo!

468
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,310
Muneto!

469
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,950
Mother! Why? WHY?!!!

470
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:11,430
That smoke...
It's them, isn't it?

471
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:18,440
Yes. Their souls are one,
returning to heaven.

472
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:28,410
It was Chuan Zui Ji...
Our using Maitreya's power.

473
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,790
The power of
two peoples love.

474
