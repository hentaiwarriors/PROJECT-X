1
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,801
Somebody! Anybody! Please!

2
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:40,573
What's wrong?

3
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,208
Charm, what's happened?

4
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,742
Damn! What happened here?

5
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,875
Hold on! You've got to hold on, Charm!

6
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,487
A doctor! Call a doctor!

7
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:01,983
House of the Forbidden Fruit

8
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:06,666
And the blue-collar jobs have been
transferred State-side?

9
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,428
Yes.

10
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,869
Unofficially, we've called it an
administrative move,

11
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,638
so no negative publicity has resulted.

12
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:15,108
I see. Let's make this the last time we meet.

13
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:20,876
The South African Public Prosecutor
shouldn't be coming here so often.

14
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:26,208
However, this time I'm on
a private vacation.

15
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,648
That's true.

16
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:57,409
It seems that her nerves are worn thin.

17
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,484
Is that so?

18
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,556
At any rate, have her rest quietly.

19
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,354
Charm must be in pretty bad shape.

20
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,061
Please take care.

21
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:13,433
What does she do when she
locks herself in her room?

22
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,834
Do you know?

23
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:15,960
No.

24
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,596
Have you heard anything?

25
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,701
You'll know soon enough.

26
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,254
The automotive company was
just camouflage.

27
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:38,258
Their real goal is the South African
diamond mines.

28
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,561
Those are the lifeblood of
the Gloria family.

29
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,464
That's why it took such a
heavy toll on Charm.

30
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,867
Mother, we can't push Charm any longer.

31
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,528
I know that!

32
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,375
Say, is Charm going to be all right?

33
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,277
Mary, you don't have to worry, okay?

34
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,471
Everything will be fine.

35
00:02:59,012 --> 00:02:59,812
But!

36
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,248
So what do we do now?

37
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,950
What should we do?

38
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,910
Well, someone will have to be our
champion in place of Charm.

39
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,991
Mother, I'll do it!

40
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:15,228
I'm sorry, but you aren't the right one.

41
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,031
But who else is there?

42
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,692
If not me, then who?

43
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,402
Yes. You are not the only candidates.

44
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,108
But their virtue is unproven, isn't it?

45
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,376
That's correct.

46
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,345
But I believe that one of them
will prove to be right.

47
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,416
What do you mean?

48
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,180
At any rate, I will handle the situation.

49
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,917
Please don't cause any needless scenes.

50
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,861
Then you aren't good enough?

51
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:00,936
Mother seems to be pinning her hopes
on you and Kira.

52
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,009
On me and Kira?

53
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:10,946
The two of you are also descendants
of the Gloria family.

54
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,958
Is that so?

55
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,519
If you'll only be our champion,

56
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,166
I'll do anything.

57
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,463
Anything?

58
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,570
Do anything?

59
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,076
No!

60
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,138
We'll be seen!

61
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,820
Good! It's so good.

62
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,359
I'm all right, so leave me alone!

63
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:05,804
Madam.

64
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,541
Mr. Kira, what's the matter?

65
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,909
What's wrong with you?

66
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,877
You're usually so calm.

67
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,679
Calm?

68
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,185
It's simply a front.

69
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:24,646
Being the "champion" of this family
is simply a front?

70
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,060
So you've discovered the truth.

71
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,362
Madam...

72
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,645
From the outside looking in,
it seems as if I rule this family,

73
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,443
but in truth it is all Charm's work.

74
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,043
I can't do anything on my own.

75
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,791
Please cheer up.

76
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,062
Mr. Kira, I have to apologize to you.

77
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,270
I've been keeping a secret.

78
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,612
You and Mr. Beowulf are blood relations
of the Gloria family.

79
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:28,049
When you trace your family line,
it is mixed with our blood.

80
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,191
Why didn't you say something earlier?

81
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,327
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,696
I didn't want to coerce you.

83
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:42,435
I wanted you to think of
this family as your own.

84
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,571
So that's how it is.

85
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,540
I am related to the Gloria family.

86
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,184
Plymouth?

87
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,918
Plymouth?

88
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,779
Hey, Plymouth!

89
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,433
What do you want?

90
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,923
How are you feeling?

91
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,134
Plymouth? Have you seen Plymouth?

92
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,176
He's gone.

93
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,582
Don't worry.

94
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:36,186
Plymouth thinks you're his mother, right?

95
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,925
There's no reason he would stray very far.

96
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,960
I know...

97
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,096
Here!

98
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,868
See, he missed your smell.

99
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,803
Don't look! Don't touch!
Don't come close!

100
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,073
Is that your computer?

101
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,040
That's...

102
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,477
It's my private computer.

103
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,967
I'll borrow it for just a bit.

104
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,408
Hey!

105
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,081
Don't touch it!

106
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,316
It's okay.

107
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,978
Maybe you could leave some of
this work to me?

108
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,310
Leave it to you?

109
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,852
What do you mean?

110
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,715
It seems that I have the
same blood as you do.

111
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,490
The same blood?

112
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,394
Yes, the same bloodline.

113
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,434
Teacher?

114
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,475
What about the next problem?

115
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,209
Oh yes, another problem.

116
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,950
It's about the diamond mines
in South Africa.

117
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,712
Yes!

118
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:44,190
A mining company wishes to layoff
a large number of workers.

119
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,862
The government decides the company has
sufficient cause and allows the layoffs.

120
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,498
Of course, the diamond output
decreases dramatically.

121
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,126
At this rate, the business will soon
become bankrupt.

122
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,070
What would you do, Mary?

123
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,039
Well, I would... I would...

124
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,913
Raise their wages and...

125
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,006
Oh, but the government...

126
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,675
It's okay. I don't know what to do either.

127
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,786
What are you doing?

128
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,669
First, you take it out gently.

129
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,670
Mary!

130
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,830
Wow! It's true!

131
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,273
It's getting bigger!

132
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,880
Wow! It's so warm and hard!

133
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,784
It's big!

134
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,717
Now, just like an ice cream cone.

135
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:07,404
Naomi told me that if I did this,
then Teacher would be happy!

136
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:08,896
Teacher?

137
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:09,970
Yes...

138
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,151
Mary!

139
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:28,557
Don't!

140
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,662
Stop!

141
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,963
You mustn't!

142
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,765
No, let me go!

143
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,427
I'm the one who's supposed to
do things like that!

144
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,238
Why? Why can't I do them?

145
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,539
Why not?

146
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,007
I won't be a virgin forever!

147
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,844
Mary...

148
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,879
Cecil, you're jealous!

149
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,914
You want to keep Teacher all to yourself!

150
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,381
It's true, isn't it? It's true!

151
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:51,944
Stupid Cecil!

152
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,918
Mary...

153
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,993
What is it about her?

154
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,962
Why is Mary so special?

155
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:10,057
Mary lost her parents at an early age.

156
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,806
It seems that something happened
to her afterwards.

157
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,969
She won't say anything about it.

158
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,447
Now that she's part of the Gloria family,

159
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,416
we've decided that she'll never
have to suffer again.

160
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,019
So that's how it is.

161
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:32,582
But you can't keep her in
the hothouse forever.

162
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,628
Mary is already trying to
get out by herself.

163
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:39,587
Besides, there's a wind blowing
that will destroy the hothouse.

164
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,258
It may destroy me as well.

165
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,984
Yo! You doing it?

166
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,359
Doing what?

167
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:11,819
It's obvious! Scheming to become
this family's champion.

168
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:13,933
Not interested in the job.

169
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,701
Don't play stupid!

170
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:20,661
Enough wealth to support a whole country
would fall into your pocket.

171
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,175
At the rate it's going, I wonder about that.

172
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,941
It's not only the wealth, it's the women too.

173
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,910
Isn't it?

174
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,084
It seems if you can save the family
from the pinch it's in,

175
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,487
you get to be the "champion".

176
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,717
It'll be ME or you.

177
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,066
And?

178
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,869
Kira's realized it too.

179
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:55,296
The quick way to save this family is to
find out how Boone's hidden money flows.

180
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,211
If I can bury Boone with my own hands,

181
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,314
then everything else will have
a happy ending.

182
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,785
It's not like you to try so hard.

183
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,221
Yeah? Well, it's for you too.

184
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,419
Oops!

185
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,992
Tight security after all.

186
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,763
No!

187
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,792
Mary?

188
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,837
What's the matter?

189
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:25,895
Well...

190
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,641
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

191
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,875
This afternoon?

192
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,342
Cecil said...

193
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,415
She said that Teacher is afraid
of the thunder,

194
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,383
and to come and be with you.

195
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,964
You're so kind, aren't you, Mary?

196
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,606
Teacher?

197
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,858
Just now, your tongue...

198
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,325
You didn't like it?

199
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,944
This is embarrassing!

200
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,655
That's...

201
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,371
No, don't!

202
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,242
You're beautiful, Mary.

203
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,646
Beautiful? I'm beautiful?

204
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,613
Yes.

205
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,815
Teacher, I'm scared.

206
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,810
Scared?

207
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,548
I feel like I'm not going to be me anymore.

208
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,786
That's right. You're going to change, Mary.

209
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,625
Change?

210
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,464
I will?

211
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,761
Yes.

212
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,231
Teacher!

213
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,123
Mary?

214
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,492
No, it's okay.

215
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,791
Continue, Teacher. Please.

216
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,915
It hurts!

217
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,588
It hurts, but beyond that...

218
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,056
Beyond that is a place that feels good.

219
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,468
That's the place. You go there, Mary.

220
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,026
Go there and change.

221
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,606
Change?

222
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,903
I will?

223
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,481
Change!

224
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,113
Teacher, are you awake?

225
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,555
Mary!

226
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,318
Good morning, Teacher.

227
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,659
Good morning.

228
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,457
Teacher, I've had a flash of inspiration!

229
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,228
Yesterday's problem, the diamond mine.

230
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,304
I know a really important person
in South Africa.

231
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,473
If I asked him nicely,

232
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,941
I think he'd help us out.

233
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,712
Really?

234
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,514
That sounds like a good idea.

235
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,649
Isn't it?

236
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:08,586
That person said, "Mary, you're so cute!
I'd do anything for you!"

237
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,124
I've wanted to tell someone that
for a long time,

238
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,127
but everyone kept telling me not to worry,

239
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,788
so I've been waiting.

240
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,966
Well, so who is this person?

241
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:25,733
He's South Africa's president,
or something like that.

242
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,041
Mary, is his name...

243
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,208
A dance?

244
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,681
Yes, please!

245
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,217
You may not.

246
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,052
I know you don't make many requests,

247
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,721
but right now the Gloria family...

248
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,124
Michelle, Mary is...

249
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,092
It's for the sake of the Gloria family!

250
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,363
I want to do what I can!

251
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,729
I'm Charm's big sister!

252
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,901
But you...

253
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,870
Please let Mary do as she thinks best!

254
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,405
But...

255
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:04,042
I can't just sit here and do nothing anymore!

256
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,745
It's all right! Teacher will be with me!

257
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,147
Right, Teacher?

258
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,114
Yes.

259
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,378
As long as Teacher's with me,
I can do anything!

260
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,138
We have been expecting you, Mr. Boone.

261
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,193
To think that Mary would throw a party!

262
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,161
Do you think it's his idea?

263
00:19:56,562 --> 00:20:00,328
Just what is Kira planning?

264
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,391
Cecil! Where's Cecil?!

265
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,904
Are you the one who invited me?

266
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,332
Who knows?

267
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,843
Is it wise for you to be frivolously dancing?

268
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,244
I hear the mining operation is floundering.

269
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,432
Mary!

270
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:02,027
Ladies and gentlemen, I am the one who
invited you here tonight,

271
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,688
my name is Mary Gloria.

272
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,498
What?

273
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,696
That's the South African Prosecutor.

274
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,240
Why is he here?

275
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:21,709
This evening my friend from
South Africa is joining us.

276
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,307
Please welcome President Robert.

277
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:36,895
For inviting me here this evening
to this grand dance,

278
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,563
I thank you very much.

279
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:44,403
But in truth, I am standing here with
my soul in torment.

280
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,406
It has come to my attention
that the Gloria family,

281
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,309
with whom my country has strong ties,

282
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,546
has been the victim of a dire mistake in
regards to their commercial enterprises.

283
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:59,040
I regret to report that large bribes have
filtered through the bureaucracy.

284
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:06,591
It has been determined that the funds for
the bribes came from the Boone Company.

285
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:15,200
These bribes have cost the Gloria family and
the citizens of my country large losses.

286
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,236
As a representative of the government,

287
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:23,868
I promise that a thorough investigation
will be made and strict penalties applied.

288
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,980
Mr. President?

289
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:34,953
Was that all right?

290
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,614
Yes, thank you!

291
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,091
It was for your sake, Miss.

292
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,719
If something like this can help you,
then call on me anytime.

293
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,095
Bastard!

294
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,722
Was it you?!

295
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,658
You told them everything, didn't you?!

296
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,461
I had no choice!

297
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,205
Shut up!

298
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,194
Quiet, please!

299
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,009
This is the House of Gloria.

300
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,373
I'll just keep this for you.

301
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:10,247
Ladies and Gentlemen, I have something
important to tell you.

302
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,192
I realize it is quite sudden,

303
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,820
but I am engaged to Kira Akushino.

304
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,973
He beat me to it.

305
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,601
That's too bad. Or is it?

306
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,386
Miss Mary!

307
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,833
You've been charged with felony tax evasion!

308
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,801
Are the allegations about South Africa true?

309
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,771
Is there any truth in the rumors about
the condition of your business?

310
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,772
Just one comment!

311
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,473
Just one comment, please!

312
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,441
Mr. Boone, please comment! Mr. Boone!

313
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,809
You damned Gloria family!

314
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,938
Congratulations!

315
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,946
Cecil...

316
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,689
Mr. Kira!

317
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,657
Cecil, you and I...

318
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,061
It's okay.

319
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,028
Cecil!

320
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,293
Only...

321
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:27,665
Only?

322
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,203
Sometimes,

323
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,375
do it with me too!

324
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,658
You did well, Mary.

325
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,227
I couldn't have done it if you
weren't there, Teacher.

326
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,560
I thought I was going to faint.

327
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,539
No, that wouldn't have happened.

328
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,837
And I'm not "Teacher" anymore.

329
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,945
We're engaged now, aren't we?

330
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,078
You'll always be my Teacher.

331
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,620
I'm so glad! It's so great!

332
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,289
Mary is so pretty.

333
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,256
Yes.

334
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,826
Maybe it's time for us to retire?

335
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:28,884
That's true.

336
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,595
Let's depend on them.

337
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,056
Yes!

338
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,767
Mary's changed.

339
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:17,164
No, maybe it's that the promise
she already had blossomed.

340
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,552
Her way of making others happy
with her own happiness

341
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,956
and her ability to make people take action

342
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,891
definitely suit her for the champion
of the Gloria family.

343
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,756
And...

344
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,557
Above all, she moved my soul.
