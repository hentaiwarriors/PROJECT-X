1
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,780
I see it!

2
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,720
It's the seal of the Blue Dragon!

3
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,530
This isn't good.

4
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,420
Who's there?

5
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,740
It's you again?

6
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,330
Yeah...

7
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,810
Damn you!

8
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,010
Stay right there!

9
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:26,710
I'm sorry!

10
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,590
It's Takarada.

11
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,150
It's Takarada.
You're always causing
the creepiest trouble, kid!

12
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:28,250
You're always causing
the creepiest trouble, kid!

13
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,910
Oh, it's him again.
You're always causing
the creepiest trouble, kid!

14
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,090
I bet he was looking for junk again.

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,680
I bet he was looking for junk again.
There's a reason for the trouble!

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,930
I won't let you walk away today!
That kid cut my class again
for some stupid treasure hunt.

17
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:33,960
That kid cut my class again
for some stupid treasure hunt.

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,730
Please listen!
That kid cut my class again
for some stupid treasure hunt.

19
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:34,860
That kid cut my class again
for some stupid treasure hunt.

20
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,690
Please listen to me!
That kid cut my class again
for some stupid treasure hunt.

21
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,060
Go!

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,800
Shut up!
Go!

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,760
Oh, Mari!

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,290
What are you doing here?

25
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,130
What do you mean, by saying that?

26
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,030
Aren't we on an art class field trip?

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,160
Sorry. Hold this a sec.

28
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,660
Wait, Go!

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:48,970
Hey, hey!

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,630
Look at this!

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,900
There's a great treasure in this shrine!

32
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,600
Shut up!

33
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,200
According to the booklet
in this treasure magazine...

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,370
In this shrine...

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,010
...there's a secret door to
the treasure of Saramandara!

36
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:00,890
What?

37
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,110
Salamander?

38
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,720
Guardian Priestess,
I'm counting on you!

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,020
Gramps, watch out.

40
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,920
Idiots!

41
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,070
Someone, help me!

42
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,400
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

43
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm sorry!

44
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,270
Go!

45
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,700
Sis!

46
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,640
Leave this to me.

47
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,600
Run.

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,410
Sis...

49
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,520
Go?

50
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,780
Go?

51
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,320
Ms. Mizuki, teach him to
never mess with this shrine again!

52
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,690
He's still holding it up?

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,030
Go!

54
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,830
Thank you, Sis.

55
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,730
Go, don't!

56
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,360
Not good.

57
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,210
This is a thirty story building!

58
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,470
I knew that, but...

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,860
As you can see, I
always have a paraglider handy!

60
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,670
I knew that would happen!

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,050
Hey!

62
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,820
Are you okay?

63
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,830
Looks like it.

64
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,890
What's he up to?

65
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,860
Calm down.

66
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,800
Danger comes with any adventure.

67
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,110
L-In this case, I'd better...

68
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,080
I feel it...

69
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,240
Very strongly...

70
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,590
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

71
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,280
I am Rane.

72
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,590
Rane Che Pani Coras.

73
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,930
A taxi runs in my tummy
delivering sheets with that look.

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,590
This weed is cooked round and chewy.

75
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,440
On a hungry lake sometimes.

76
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,610
Excuse me?

77
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,610
Do you understand me?

78
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,440
A monkey's sock.

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,870
Looking back occasionally and rest...

80
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,970
Scallion?

81
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,540
Beef scallion?

82
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,980
It's an elf!

83
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,560
Hey, he fell.

84
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:53,930
An elf!
Hey, he fell.

85
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,190
Figures.

86
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,730
I see!
Figures.

87
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:54,760
Figures.

88
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:54,990
There's an elf!
Figures.

89
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,030
There's an elf!

90
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,330
There's an elf!
Go!

91
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,030
It's an elf! It's an elf!

92
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,060
It's an elf! It's an elf!

93
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,320
It's an elf! It's an elf!

94
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,460
Is something wrong?

95
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,860
Can't you fly?

96
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,340
My socks are falling off!

97
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,630
Go!

98
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,240
Go!

99
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,870
Yeah?

100
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,870
Sis!

101
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,070
What the hell are you doing?

102
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,740
I'm falling!

103
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,180
Want some help?

104
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,480
P-Please!

105
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,020
No problem!

106
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,720
Activate mecha Senju!

107
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,620
Salvation mode on!

108
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,260
Elfie!

109
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,890
Elfie!
Cigar store!

110
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,420
Cigar store!

111
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,720
Wow, looks like he's saved.

112
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,120
I'm so relieved.

113
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:34,990
Dummy.

114
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,860
Elfie! Elfie! Elfie!

115
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,430
Take me to the world
of dreams and adventure!

116
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,550
Cap.

117
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,220
We've detected an
anomaly in District D.

118
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,060
There seems to be a spacial gap in the
northwest area of the operation center.

119
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,060
Also, I don't like the Fire
Department's special task force.

120
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,900
They brought in Senju to District D
eighteen seconds after the incident.

121
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,530
They're investigating on their own.

122
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,700
Hell, big surprise.

123
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,110
I'll report it to the president...

124
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:03,620
Fi er'uoy gnidaer siht sdrawkcab,
uoy evah oot hcum emit no ruoy sdnah.

125
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,050
I see.

126
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,410
You already had the data.

127
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,090
So, you'll report it to the president?

128
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,330
I understand.

129
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,690
Then I'll file an official
complaint with the Fire Department.

130
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,960
Gotchabaguse!

131
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,440
It's an elf! It's an elf! It's an elf!

132
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:28,870
Go! Go!

133
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,780
Wait! What do you have?

134
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,440
What about an elf?

135
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,540
Is that it in your bag?

136
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,120
Show me! Show me!

137
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,810
Sure, sure. Take a look.

138
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,410
It's an elf, right?

139
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,280
Isn't it cute?

140
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,440
L-It's really true!

141
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,210
How? Why?

142
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,840
This encounter between
Go Takarada and an elf...

143
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,080
...seems like it was a coincidence,
but it feels like it was fated to happen!

144
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,850
Where the hidden treasure of
Saramandara sleeps, there is a passage to...

145
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,330
...another dimension, and this
city and the elf's world is connected.

146
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,690
This proves that the door to
the treasure exists as I theorized...

147
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,940
The only surprise was the
connection with an elf which is my biggest...

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,900
...and only oversight.

149
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,130
It makes me laugh!

150
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,740
In other words...

151
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,900
The accurate guide to the
treasure was not the magazine...

152
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,770
...but the Scriptures of Tazurai!

153
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,740
It's Tazurai!

154
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,140
Wait a minute!

155
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,220
This is it!

156
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,040
Ta... zu...

157
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,020
The Scriptures of Tazurai.

158
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,550
In this book...

159
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,450
Right here! Read it right here!

160
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,110
Let's see...

161
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,530
A long, long time ago, a tiny person
fell from the sky above Kurakama Village.

162
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,250
What a surprise...

163
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:18,950
What is this?

164
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,120
Just read on!

165
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,990
The little person was called the One
Inch Priest, and dug the treasure mountain...

166
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,230
Here. Dig, dig...

167
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,000
What the hell is this?

168
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,560
Get it?

169
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,830
I don't get it!

170
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,840
In other words, the key to
the hidden treasure is the elf.

171
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,200
It says so in that book.

172
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,340
Hold it.

173
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,280
An elf?

174
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,880
This book is all
about the One Inch Priest!

175
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,880
Dummy, it's the same thing!

176
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,510
I don't think so.

177
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,780
I can't argue with an amateur!

178
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,960
This book was
written in the Kamakura era.

179
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,330
Back then, people
called elves One Inch Priests!

180
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,090
No way!

181
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,890
There's no mystery about it.

182
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,930
There is!

183
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,870
Sorry, Elfie. I forgot about you.

184
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,410
But...

185
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,370
You look really good in those clothes!

186
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,840
Please take me to the treasure!

187
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,870
My hard work will pay off soon!

188
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,050
That's my elf!

189
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,350
She's so dependable!

190
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,980
Dad! Mom!

191
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,380
I bet you've discovered some
great artifact in Europe by now.

192
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,930
Having been raised by archaeologist
parents and taught everything...

193
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,600
...from insect collecting to
survival skills to ancient civilization...

194
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,330
...I turned out to be such a healthy guy.

195
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,940
Maybe I'm really the reincarnation
of some great, legendary warrior...

196
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,530
Go.

197
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,010
Wait...

198
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,570
That would mean that
I'm not a human being.

199
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,300
Go...

200
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,040
So who are my real parents?

201
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,170
Hey, Go!

202
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,170
What?

203
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,920
What about this nymph?

204
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,540
Nymph?

205
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,380
Here.

206
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,090
The boy who met the One
Inch Priest also encountered...

207
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,620
...a nymph who controlled a dragon.

208
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,350
A nymph who controlled a dragon?

209
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,620
The disgraced apple!

210
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,500
Thanks for the taxi and tea...

211
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,830
The caterpillar dropped from the stool...

212
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,700
I came in search of the
treasure called the Four Hearts...

213
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,100
...which is the symbol
that protects our land.

214
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,510
I was guided by the legend that
was passed down the royal family.

215
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,680
I was led to this land.

216
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,880
You must be the clever
servants that my master predicted...

217
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,190
...would aid me upon
my arrival, aren't you?

218
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,650
I feel it.

219
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,620
I feel the power
between you and this land.

220
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,800
The Four Hearts must be in this land!

221
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,190
Please trust my feelings!

222
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,230
As the legend says...

223
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,640
It's still soaking in the dress
from yesterday and mushy, mushy...

224
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,820
I guess we really do
have a language barrier.

225
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,080
I got it!

226
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,650
The nymph who controls the dragon!

227
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,550
The dragon is the
fire dragon, Salamander!

228
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,690
It's not Saramandara!

229
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,880
It's Salamander!

230
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,220
And that nymph!

231
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,020
Damn it!

232
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,630
So, that priest is the nymph!

233
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,460
Let's go, Elfie!

234
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,460
Lend me some money?

235
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,370
Hey, Go!

236
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,670
What about the door?

237
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,670
Take care of it!

238
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,400
Go...

239
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,340
You left me behind again.

240
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,670
You're always like this.

241
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,270
What's all this "Elfie, Elfie" stuff?

242
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,710
Yeah!

243
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,010
I'm the only one who
played your treasure hunt games...

244
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,310
...and survival games
ever since we were children.

245
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,320
Hey, you over there!

246
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,980
I was always, always your only friend.

247
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,030
It's not just because we're neighbors...

248
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,860
Hey, Lady!

249
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,360
And you were
always leaving me behind.

250
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,130
Lady!

251
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,900
What is it?

252
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,730
Shut up with the "Lady, Lady" stuff!

253
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,240
O-Oh...

254
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,460
I'm sorry for surprising you.

255
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,980
Um, let me ask you something...

256
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,370
Did you see an elf?

257
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,410
She's about my size
and age but may look more...

258
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,580
Are you also an elf?

259
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,350
Why can I understand you?

260
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,080
Why are you floating?

261
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,410
Who is that elf with Go?

262
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,420
Why did you come to me?

263
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:03,980
Destiny?

264
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,040
What's gonna happen to me and Go?

265
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,390
Why are you wearing clothes?

266
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,190
Welcome home, Madam.

267
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,790
Would you like some dinner?

268
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,860
I'll pass!

269
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,240
Fi uoy kniht siht si looc,
yrt gnihctaw eht latsaoc bud.

270
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,680
Woh hcum doow dluow a kcuhcdoow
kcuhc fi a kcuhcdoow dlouc kcuhc doow.

271
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,590
Mr. Takuma.

272
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,120
You know...

273
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,090
I understand you just fine, but
could you make your report in writing?

274
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,050
Etik?

275
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,260
That's it, right?

276
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,200
I know that the Fire
Department is making a mess, right?

277
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,490
I know. I'm worried, too.

278
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,270
Make your report in writing...

279
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,530
No rush. Take your time.

280
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:09,620
Therefore, any trespassing during
the project is strictly prohibited...

281
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,690
The Yumenokata Foundation?

282
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,120
What is this letter?

283
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,290
It's so obnoxious!

284
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,660
Calm down, Ms. Natsuki.

285
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

286
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,150
I just...

287
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,630
...happened to be flying in
the area with my machine...

288
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,800
...when my surveillance system
detected a spacial gap in District D!

289
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,240
I know. I know.

290
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,470
That damn Yumenokata...

291
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,370
How dare they make it sound like
I was trespassing on their property!

292
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,470
You're taking it too hard...

293
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,980
Those bastards even
announced that their own task force...

294
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,710
...will take care of all the
emergencies on their property from now on!

295
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,150
You're getting worse.

296
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,660
What is it, anyway?

297
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,090
That Yumenokata Project?

298
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,330
They include almost the entire city!

299
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,990
I wonder...

300
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,160
You don't know, Manager?

301
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,200
That's right.

302
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,160
All I got was a notice from
the Ministry of Development.

303
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,460
And?

304
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,770
They say it's a fabulous plan.

305
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:03,870
That's all?

306
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,770
That's all.

307
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,370
That's all...

308
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,210
Ms. Natsuki.

309
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,750
What is it?

310
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,510
The Fire Department
isn't a bunch of morons.

311
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,010
The important thing is to protect
the city and its citizens from danger...

312
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,250
Right?

313
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,950
We have ways of monitoring
outrageous corporate activity.

314
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,160
So, they approved
the investigation team?

315
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,230
Bingo!

316
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,200
This is the permission.

317
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,270
Please, can I be in charge?

318
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,290
Please?

319
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,100
Is it okay?

320
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,300
Me! Me!

321
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:33,800
Oh...

322
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,390
But that's...

323
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,230
No!

324
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,330
Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!

325
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,200
Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!

326
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,110
Say yes!

327
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,840
Yah!

328
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,700
Thank you!

329
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,540
Oh, my.

330
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,110
Did I say yes?

331
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,750
Elfie!

332
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,310
Don't you smell some hidden treasure?

333
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,790
Let's go treasure hunting!

334
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,390
Let's go treasure hunting!
Kimchee, namuru!

335
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:54,820
Kimchee, namuru!

336
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,090
Um...

337
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,590
Excuse me, Ms. Elf?

338
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,200
What'll I do if she's dead?

339
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,570
Yub ajnin stedac
splendid report ti skcor.

340
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,070
Yrt cigam s'resu bulc!

341
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,750
L-I'm sorry, Mr. Zenshuin.

342
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,980
Ekaf, no problem.

343
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,750
Mari...

344
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,150
I love you.

345
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,440
Master Zenshuin, dinner is served.

346
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,260
Uknin.

347
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,040
You idiot!

348
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,810
Stop it!

349
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,310
L-I'm sorry!

350
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,370
How dare you!

351
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,980
Do you know who I am?

352
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,440
Look!

353
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,390
My clothes melted!

354
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,440
You pervert!

355
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,460
Um... Um...

356
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,220
Where's my harken?

357
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,580
You mean this?

358
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,620
Give that back!

359
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,890
Oh, I feel sick!

360
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,530
That's amazing!

361
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,170
You're like a witch!

362
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,800
I am a witch!

363
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,140
I'm Mari.

364
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,970
Mari Yumenokata.

365
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,870
Oh, Mari?

366
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,810
I'm Leen Kyami Coonyo.

367
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,210
Just call me Leen.

368
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,040
Leen, is it?

369
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:25,980
Say, by the way...

370
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,920
Say, by the way... Hey, the story is...

371
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,150
My old friend Go
met an elf like you...

372
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,090
My old friend Go met an elf like you...
By making a gap in Panymora...

373
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,120
By making a
gap in Panyora...

374
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,450
...and took off By making a
to some treasure. Gap in Panyora...

375
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:30,660
...and took off
to some treasure.

376
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,290
...and took off... I was able to find
to some treasure. Elf Princess Rane.

377
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:33,460
...and took off
to some treasure.

378
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:33,820
...and took off I can sense
to some treasure. That she's nearby.

379
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,130
I can sense
that she's nearby.

380
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,560
I can sense
Is she one of you? That she's nearby.

381
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:35,790
Is she one of you?

382
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,060
Her scent
is strong on you.

383
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,200
But you aren't Her scent
exactly the same. Is strong on you.

384
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,230
But you aren't
exactly the same.

385
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,130
But you aren't exactly the same.
Did you know that?

386
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:40,900
What?

387
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,370
What? What?

388
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,010
Anyway, Salamander's
treasure must be hidden in this shrine.

389
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,440
The problem is finding
the door to the treasure.

390
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,310
According to the
Scriptures of Tazurai...

391
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,610
Elfie, you're the key to this door!

392
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,650
I'm counting on you, Elfie!

393
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,020
A hint... I need a hint!

394
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,690
Waiting for rain and padding.

395
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,120
Pretty alligator, stolen pond and sweet
bean bread definitely come down, yes...

396
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,360
This young man is
trying to show me the way...

397
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,260
I can feel a strong power
guiding me to the Four Hearts...

398
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,930
I feel a great power...

399
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,700
A strange feeling...

400
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,600
What?

401
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,410
You're glowing, Elfie!

402
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,380
In one of the first
giants you encounter...

403
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,680
In one of the first
giants you encounter...

404
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,940
What is that?

405
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,550
It's an old saying in Panyora.

406
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,550
I can understand you, Elfie!

407
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,850
What's going on?

408
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,590
I've never experienced this before.

409
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,530
You've got a nice voice, Elfie.

410
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,430
Elfie?

411
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,060
My name is Rane.

412
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,960
Rane Che Pani Coras.

413
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:55,860
Rane?

414
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:56,900
Rane, huh?

415
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,570
I'm Go Takarada.

416
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,430
Go?

417
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,000
Say it!

418
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,580
Say it again, Elfie!

419
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,080
That old saying!

420
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,040
All right.

421
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,210
In one of the first
giants you encounter...

422
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,080
A large stone not in people's eyes?

423
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,750
A large stone not in people's eyes?

424
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,360
Um, it doesn't go like that.

425
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,450
I got it!

426
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,660
I knew this had to be the one!

427
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,900
A big stone.

428
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,440
This has to be it!

429
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,260
The stone has to be
exposed to people's eyes!

430
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,770
It needs to be moved!

431
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,530
Here!

432
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,700
You can see this spot from anywhere!

433
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,270
In other words!

434
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,200
It's in this garden!

435
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,540
Control.

436
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,220
This is Dark Bunny.

437
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,760
We're on the
foundation's private property.

438
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:46,580
Roger!

439
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,120
Redeye Bunny, stay
in the west quadrant!

440
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,790
Longyear Bunny, proceed eastward!

441
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,730
Yes, ma'am!

442
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,420
Find out what they're hiding!

443
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,320
Yes, ma'am!

444
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,100
Chief!

445
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,670
Go ahead.

446
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,630
There are some
strange people in District D.

447
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,140
Altogether, there's...

448
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:06,870
...a lot.

449
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,640
They're emitting some
sort of communication signal.

450
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,080
It must be the the Fire
Department's investigation team.

451
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,580
They're getting in our way.

452
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,550
Well done, Mr. Takuma.

453
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,650
Using examples from
ancient ruins and Feng Sui...

454
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:26,490
This hi-tech project
is the work of a genius.

455
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,590
I really like this report
with a how-to-read manual.

456
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,900
Thank you.

457
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,670
So, what you're saying is...

458
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:40,970
...this spacial gap in District D is
interfering with the Salamander project.

459
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,910
Is that what your
concern is, Mr. Takuma?

460
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,580
Nihs aidan.

461
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,210
Nihs aidan?

462
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,780
Nihs aidan.

463
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,480
Cap!

464
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,520
The Fire Department
is in District D again.

465
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,720

466
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,630
But the Salamander is in District D...

467
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,190
And with that earlier incident...

468
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,590
Can we tease them a little?

469
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,030

470

474

Order the
Salamander Unit to District D!

475
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,380
Stand by with presentation level 7!

476
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,360
Our target is the Fire Department.

477
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,690
Gotchabaguse!

478
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,760
Gotchabaguse!

Careful... Careful...

480
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,740
Careful, big stone.

481
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,040
Elfie, this is kind of
boring for an adventure, but...

482
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,050
...I'm getting nervous just
thinking about the treasure!

483
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,050
Tummy belt going down?

484
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,910
Good work.

485
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,750
What?

486
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,750
Ms. Mizuki, you may go home now.

487
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,360
I don't have to.

488
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,590
Something's happening, right?

489
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,760
So, you're staying?

490
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,670
For overtime pay, of course.

491
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,200
I see.

492
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,110
This is how you spell your ABC's...

493
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,540
This and that and so on...

494
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,290
Surprised, Ms. Mizuki?

495
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,950
You're the first to see this room.

496
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,230
It's part of the Yumenokata
Foundation's City Amusement Plan.

497
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,690
The Yumenokata Foundation?

498
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,800
That infamous city
development project?

499
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,390
Yes.

500
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,660
Actually...

501
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,530
...it's an outrageous plan to turn
the whole city into an amusement park.

502
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,810
This is one of the
chosen areas of the theme park.

503
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,450
I guess the system will be
activated now on the president's whim.

504
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,040
Activated?

505
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,220
The state-of-the-art roller
coaster, Salamander Mountain!

506
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,320
Salamander?

507
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,020
Program standby okay!

508
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,660
Gotchabaguse!

509
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,750
Haruki.

510
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,630
Mizuki, what are you doing there?

511
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,990
I'm a part-time priestess.

512
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:16,690
I see.

513
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,330
Haruki, sorry for such sort notice...

514
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,960
...but could you lend me
that purple suit tomorrow?

515
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,540
Why?

516
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,270
A date?

517
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,200
Really?

518
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,440
But not that one.

519
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,100
Why not?

520
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,470
It won't look good on you.

521
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,010
They're twins...

522
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:29,880
They're twins...
We look the same!

523
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,180
We look the same!

524
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,010
All right!

525
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,790
I moved the big stone to the
garden to be exposed to people's eyes.

526
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,860
Finally, something will happen...

527
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,580
Something...

528
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,530
Right?

529
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,120
Big fat!

530
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,060
W-What is that?

531
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,200
Fur ball is rolling and pants...

532
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:51,790
What's that?

533
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,890
What's wrong?

534
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,770
A rumbling sound
like a beast's roar!

535
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,600
What?

536
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:56,870
A beast's roar?

537
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,110
Salamander
A beast's roar? Activation okay!

538
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,210
Only raccoons and
wild pigs are up there!

539
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,950
Open all gates!
Only raccoons and wild pigs are up there!

540
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,580
All entrance
gates open!

541
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
All entrance It doesn't sound
gates open! Like a raccoon!

542
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:03,650
All entrance
gates open!

543
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:03,750
Could it be
a monster?

544
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,850
Could it be
Open exit gates! A monster?

545
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,150
Open exit gates!

546
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:05,350
Open exit gates! Give me a break!

547
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,550
Give me a break!

548
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,180
All exit gates opened! Give me a break!

549
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,320
All exit gates opened!

550
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,590
All exit gates opened!
Don't you guys have any balls!?

551
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,920
Don't you guys
have any balls?

552
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,520
Don't you guys
Start count down! Have any balls?

553
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:08,720
Start count down!

554
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,190
Start count down! Yes!

555
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,890
You didn't have
to answer that!

556
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,390
You didn't have
Five! To answer that!

557
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,610
You didn't have
to answer that!

558
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,810
How's the big stone?

559
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,050
No reaction yet?

560
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:20,790
What?

561
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,590
What's going on?

562
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,560
It's here!

563
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,220
What's there?

564
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,600
A monster!

565
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,200
Asshole!

566
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,080
Salamander!

567
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,240
The fire dragon and
guardian of the hidden treasure!

568
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,590
This is Salamander Mountain...

569
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,930
Beautiful...

570
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,700
M-My body...

571
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,500
Elfie, are you okay?

572
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,470
Elfie!

573
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,230
My body is getting hot!

574
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,700
It's like I'm burning!

575
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,200
Hang in there!

576
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,070
You're my...

577
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,150
My very important Elfie!

578
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,280
Important?

579
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,340
That's right!

580
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,380
Very important treasure...

581
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,690
I felt it again...

582
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,550
Strongly...

583
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,950
Go is guiding me.

584
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,700
It's coming!

585
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,670
T-These letters...

586
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,800
I saw them in the Scriptures of Tazurai!

587
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,300
This is my land's...

588
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,140
Panyora's language.

589
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,540
Here it is!

590
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,480
It's these symbols!

591
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,750
To the clever adventurer who
will solve Salamander's mystery...

592
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,490
This is the heart
stone of the Salamander.

593
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,850
Follow the guidance of Tazurai
and move on to the next treasure...

594
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,920
Wow! I knew it!

595
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,960
This stone itself is the hidden treasure!

596
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:05,430
No, it says, "Sorry,
you didn't win. Go east."

597
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,300
So it's just a signpost.

598
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,330
You did it, Go!

599
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,170
That's my boy, Go!

600
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,110
Please listen to me...

601
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:19,850
The treasure is rolling away!

602
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,250
The signpost is rolling away!
The treasure is rolling away!

603
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,360
It's wonderful.

604
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,370
It's dangerous!

605
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,340
Ms. Mizuki, let's get out of here!

606
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,380
T-The monster was
actually a roller coaster!

607
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,380
But it exploded!

608
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,320
There are fires on the mountain!

609
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,820
Damn that Yumenokata!

610
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,120
Making such a dangerous thing!

611
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,960
Those Fire Department bozos!

612
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,350
What did they do?

613
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,220
Hey, is the Salamander broken already?

614
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,630
Azwoy! My project
si enog htiw eht dniw!

615
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,730
Look, Elfie...

616
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:21,010
Salamander's treasure is
vanishing with its guardian dragon...

617
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,910
The dragon protected
the treasure by destroying it.

618
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,450
Wasn't that just an accident?

619
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,750
This is the prologue to our adventure.

620
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,920
It's only just begun, Elfie!

621
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,090
The true adventure!

622
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:36,620
Let's go!

623
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,590
Treasure!

624
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,650
Go! Go!

625
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,920
Um...

626
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,830
You're looking for the
Four Hearts, aren't you?

627
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,610
Good bath...

628
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,380
Isn't it?

629
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,480
It's making my body so soft...

630
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,280
Isn't it?

631
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,380
Why did I come here anyway?

632
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,790
You came looking for the elf
that Go took with him, didn't you?

633
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,790
Yeah...

634
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,130
That's right!

635
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,930
I'm going to kill Rane!

636
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,470
Hey, what are you doing?

637
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,270
Phoenix!

638
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,440
Leen!

639
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,480
Go's elf!

640
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,920
What are you talking about?

641
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,530
Stay tuned for the next episode!
