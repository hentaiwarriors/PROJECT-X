1
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,850
My heart is turning to ice...

2
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,230
I'm being sealed in by ice that will never melt...

3
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:10,240
Thats what l thought on that day when I knew that I had really lost you...

4
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,630
His stay in the hospital is going to be even longer?

5
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,590
l'm all right. You don't need to worry.

6
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,800
Mom, l just want you to stay with dad.

7
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,800
Okay Bye

8
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,890
Oh... I have to put out the yard waste.

9
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,400
He trimmed a lot off those trees.

10
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,690
I wonder what Dad will say when he comes back from the hospital.

11
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,370
Nii-sama, do your best ok!

12
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,160
Yeah, well, l'm going...

13
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,410
You haven't forgotten anything? Do you have your handkerchief?

14
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,710
You know, l'm not in elementary school.

15
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:06,880
Hm?

16
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,750
Oh! Good Morning, Kuimiko-san.

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,090
This is Hashimoto Kumiko-san who lives next door.

18
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,550
Next door? Then she's the landlord...

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,850
Hi. l'm Narahashi Shouma and from today l'll...

20
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,600
l've already heard about you from Chisato-san.

21
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,690
Well, that makes things easy... well then, see you!

22
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,440
Ah! Nii-sama!

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,440
Geez!

24
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,240
He's that type of man... l'm sorry.

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,700
I don't really mind.

26
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,500
Then, just heat it in the microwave right before you eat.

27
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,870
I'm sorry, you have to helped me so much.

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,010
Cooking for a party is fun... a welcome home party for you brother, its realIy nice.

29
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,390
Yes... l hope you'll come too, Kuimiko-san.

30
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,930
N.. no...

31
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,350
I...

32
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,230
Kuimiko-san?

33
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,980
Uh... l won't tonight.

34
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,350
But...

35
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,240
It should be just family tonight... after all, its been ten years.

36
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,370
Let's have another party soon, it will give me more opportunity to cook.

37
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,830
Yes. Let's definately do that, Kuimiko-san.

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,660
Yes

39
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,640
What a stylish party! It's all for Nii-sama welcome home.

40
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,890
We're not related by blood, because he's the grandson of our adopted grandfather, who passed away.

41
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,400
Today...

42
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,610
The man who moved in next door...

43
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,700
He reminded me of you so much.

44
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,870
I was really surprised...

45
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,750
lt's strange, isn t it?

46
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,540
When neither his face or body looks like you at all...

47
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,130
Darling, Darling, l'm so lonely.

48
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,970
I'm not myself today...

49
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,480
Damn it, Kuu. Give me back my cigarettes.

50
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,480
No, and l mean it! You can't have it back until you finish shoveing the snow!

51
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,440
You can take a break without smoking, can't you?

52
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,900
People used to call a break, having a smoke you know.

53
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,740
That's got nothing to do with this! Oh! Kumiko-san!

54
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,360
Hm?

55
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,030
Hello!

56
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,660
Hm? Hey, Brother, why are you staring?

57
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,960
Hey Brother!

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,040
Dummy! You're embarassing her!

59
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,360
That's cause you're not listening to me at all.

60
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,440
Excuise me...

61
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,220
See you did it again, Brother!

62
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,430
Shouma-san...

63
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:02,490
When l look back... I think changes were happening inside me, where the ice had frozen everything...

64
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,910
Do you like things like that?

65
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,830
Shouma-san!

66
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,210
I'm sorry, did l surprise you?

67
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,250
You were looking at them so intently.

68
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,090
Uh...no... l'm sorry l yelIed like that.

69
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,890
Uh... um... it's a vase!

70
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,260
Huh?

71
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,600
Uh... that is...

72
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,980
l broke my vase...

73
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,310
And, I was looking for another.

74
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,190
I see.

75
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,780
l wish they had wrapped these flowers.

76
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,120
They look like green onions or cabbage in this.

77
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,510
Shouma-san, I heard you used to be a vioIinist.

78
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,050
That's in the past... presently, l'm just a poor editor for a newsletter.

79
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,430
l see...

80
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,930
What is it?

81
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,060
Um, I have a favor to ask...

82
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,550
Thank you for today.

83
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,850
Not at all. lt was just a perfomance by an amateur.

84
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,270
Your nieces are very cute.

85
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,810
It's the first time they heard a live performance of a violin.

86
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,400
They were so happy.

87
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,530
l'm... a widow...

88
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,570
What?

89
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,950
My husband was a musician, too... And, he used to play the piano for them.

90
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,410
Maybe that's why they love music.

91
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,960
Why am I doing this? Why am revealing myseIf to him like this?

92
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,420
We never made our marriage official, so my family name is still Hashimoto.

93
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,550
For some reason, my husband refused to fill out a marriage certificate.

94
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,640
My husband had cancer... I think it was because he knew.

95
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,810
That's why he never filled the papers?

96
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,610
He never ate much to begin with...

97
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,240
So I didn't realize that he was sick.

98
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,110
Oh? ls that Chisato?

99
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,900
Uh... Please let me off here. I have some shopping to do.

100
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,370
Nii-sama actually Iikes children a lot. l think he enjoyed playing for them.

101
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,370
l hope so.

102
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,040
Oh, that's right... Would you like some tea? We just got in some very good ones.

103
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,290
Yes, thank you, I will.

104
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,840
Chisato-san, you seem happier, recentIy.

105
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:58,770
It's all thanks to Nii-sama. I've been sickly since l was a child, and l've aIways thought that I would not live very long.

106
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,180
You shouldn't think that.

107
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,020
lf Nii-sama would stay. As long as Nii-sama stays... I can live on just knowing he's there.

108
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,370
I can live...

109
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,870
Chisato-san is in Iove with Shouma-san...

110
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,330
See you! We're going.

111
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,760
At some point I began to listen to what went on next door...

112
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,750
Unconciously, it was aIl so that I could see Shouma-san.

113
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,770
He's not my husband who passed away...

114
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,060
l know that...

115
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,150
I know that... but...

116
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,040
Shouma-san?

117
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,840
Hello

118
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,670
Did you just get back?

119
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,550
I had to pick up an acquaintance at the airport.

120
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,300
You seem tired.

121
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,430
l'm fine, really. See you.

122
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,600
Uh... um...

123
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,560
Yes?

124
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,730
lf it would be all right, I'd like to ask you to go out for a meal with me.

125
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,860
A meal?

126
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,780
To thank you for the favor you did for me.

127
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,820
Oh, right. Then how about this Sunday?

128
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,450
Yes

129
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,280
l'll look forward to it

130
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,870
Me, too.

131
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,500
Well, good night.

132
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,370
Good night...

133
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,220
l was the one who asked you, but you ended up treating me.

134
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,350
lt's all right. l'm satisfied with just your invitation.

135
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,680
Well, where should we go now?

136
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,690
Um... Anywhere is fine... whatever you want to do.

137
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,610
What?

138
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,280
from the moment I met you um...

139
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,160
Hashimoto-san?

140
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,540
Kuimiko's fine... that is... Please, call me Kumiko.

141
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,010
ln a place like this... what if someone comes?

142
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,930
Let them look as much as they like.

143
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,060
Eh?

144
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,060
l'm different from your husband or...

145
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,780
...do you want me to be like your husband?

146
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,010
Do as you like.

147
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,410
You have an obscene body.

148
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,490
Oh, no...

149
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,040
You didn't put on a bra... is that an invitation?

150
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,660
That's...

151
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,330
You have really big breasts.

152
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,710
Don't...

153
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,170
How about this end?

154
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,300
Oh, don't...

155
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,470
That's great, you're soaking wet.

156
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,680
Its embarassing... please, don't say it.

157
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,650
l'm going to make your wish come true.

158
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,940
Um...

159
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,280
What is it? Did you get scared?

160
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,990
No... um... in my bag.

161
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,830
Please, use this... l'm sorry.

162
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,130
You're well prepared... put it on me.

163
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:57,960
What?

164
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,420
You're doing it for yourself, aren't you?

165
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,260
B-but...

166
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,720
l don't care either way.

167
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,800
Yes...

168
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,940
Um...

169
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,910
If you want to use it, what should you do?

170
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,090
ls this okay?

171
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,840
You're very used to doing this.

172
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,770
lt's the first time l did anything like this... Ah! Please, don't be mean...

173
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,770
You're all melted inside.

174
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,110
lt seems you've been waiting for this a Iong time.

175
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,440
That's not true...

176
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,320
Please, give it to me... Pleasel

177
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,950
Do it yourself... Ma'am.

178
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,760
A man is entering me... I was sealed shut, but now I am being filled up.

179
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,300
I... can't think anymore...

180
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,680
This is the kind of man l am, ma'am. Do you hate me now?

181
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,430
The ice is melting away...

182
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,900
I believed most strongly at that moment...

183
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,150
That... nothing stays the same forever.

184
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,290
Shit! Why do I have to fix Hina's mistakes?

185
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,080
I'm sorry...

186
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,470
Hello?

187
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,560
l'm surprised that you would be the one to call me.

188
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,360
l thought you didn't like me anymore.

189
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,740
l'm sorry.

190
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,530
You don t have to apologize. Being honest to yourself is a good thing.

191
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,700
So, l'll be honet to myself as well, okay?

192
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,500
Yes...

193
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,890
Do you like it?

194
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,770
Now, l'II make you feel even better.

195
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,000
Please, put it in me... That... Please...

196
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,420
You want me to put this in?

197
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Um...

198
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,300
Are you sure you want a toy like this... Ma'am?

199
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,800
Shouma-san's...

200
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,430
Please put yours in me...

201
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,650
All right. l'll give it to you.

202
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,420
You did that nicely, Ma'am.

203
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,790
Please call me Kumiko...

204
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,760
No... You haven't become completely mine yet.

205
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,260
That's not true.

206
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,800
Put it in yourself.

207
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,890
Yes

208
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,000
Shouma-san?

209
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,210
Hello

210
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,210
Chisato-san...!

211
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,140
Since Kuu moved out, l sometimes forget and make too much.

212
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,010
And, l did it again.

213
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,650
Nii-sama ate getting home today, too. lf he's making a pest of himseIf, please tell me.

214
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,020
l'Il keep him in Iine.

215
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,030
Chisato-san... You...

216
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,540
If l try to tie Nii-sama down, he'll no longer be Nii-sama, that's how l feel.

217
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,330
ls that strange?

218
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,290
I dont know.

219
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,510
Oh, no! I have a pie in the oven!

220
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,750
Shouma-san...

221
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,670
l'm in your debt.

222
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,550
If you hadn't been there, l dont know what would have happened to Chisato.

223
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,510
Not at all... I panicked, too.

224
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,310
l heard from Kuu-san. Chisato-san can go home next week?

225
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,020
This stay in the hospital was mostly for tests, anyway.

226
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,400
lt'll become noisy again, but l hope you won't mind.

227
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,780
l'm leaving this house for awhile.

228
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:41,780
What?

229
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,870
My father is in the hospital, and my mother has been staying by his side.

230
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,290
But, l can't let my mother do all the work.

231
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,330
It's a change of players.

232
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,500
Is that right?

233
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,620
lf I keeps going this way...

234
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,010
Hm?

235
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,550
l'll seriously start to want you for myself.

236
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,220
But l can't do that.

237
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,060
At first, l was seeing my husband in you.

238
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,190
But, you're not my husband.

239
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,990
That's why, we can't go any further.

240
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,820
Kumiko?

241
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,890
Please take me...

242
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,220
not in love...

243
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,930
but as just a man and a woman.

244
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,060
Then, I'll forget you, Shouma-san...

245
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,530
If thats what you've decided.

246
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,570
Let's just do it as we are, today...

247
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,320
What...?

248
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,410
Because, it's the last time.

249
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,040
l want to feel you directIy...

250
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,000
l never knew you were so hot... inside.

251
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,270
Inside me... together!

252
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,250
Its flowing... Shouma-san's...

253
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,720
Goodbye...
