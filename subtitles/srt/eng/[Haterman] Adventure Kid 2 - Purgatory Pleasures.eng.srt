1
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,260
- Welcome home...
- You're still awake?

2
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,490
Were you working
late at the lab, dear?

3
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,700
No, actually. I was called to
the Prime Minister's...

4
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,830
...underground council
room at his residence.

5
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,630
I see.

6
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,970
I had to brief him on
the N3-C's analysis of...

7
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,450
...the data on that new bomb which
destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

8
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,250
The Imperial decree accepting
the Potsdam Accord will...

9
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,950
...probably be issued
by noon tomorrow.

10
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,520
Japan...
Japan is defeated.

11
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,790
What will happen now?

12
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,800
Neither I nor
the N3-C know that.

13
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,460
I have to get
back to the lab.

14
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,870
I'll be busy, and may
not be back for a week.

15
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,870
Hold me!

16
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,540
Dear...

17
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,140
We don't know what
will happen to us.

18
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,120
I've heard they killed
the men and raped the women...

19
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,150
...when they retook
Sakhalin and Manchukuo.

20
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,490
I couldn't live if you
saw me shamed by another man.

21
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,490
You're overreacting. We're in
no danger of that happening here.

22
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,970
Dear...
Don't you love me anymore?

23
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,530
It's been a year since
we've shared the same bed.

24
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,630
Does holding me
repulse you now?

25
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,540
Forgive me. I've kept it
to myself until now...

26
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,550
...but I can
no longer hold you.

27
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,190
I can no longer satisfy you.
I'm impotent, now.

28
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,850
Dear...

29
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,790
Forgive me.
I must get back to the lab.

30
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,160
Dear!

31
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,580
Military police!

32
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,380
Dr. Masago, you're under arrest
on suspicion of espionage!

33
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,150
What?!
What are you doing?!

34
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,880
Stop it!
There must be some mistake!

35
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,590
Michiyo!

36
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,220
Dear!

37
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,890
Leave my wife alone!

38
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,160
Shut up!

39
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,800
Dear!

40
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,170
I will purify this foul woman
whom the traitor has defiled!

41
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,940
No!
What are you doing?!

42
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,420
No, don't! Stop!
You can't do this!

43
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,180
Stop it!
Unhand my wife!

44
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,020
Silence!

45
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,920
Dear!

46
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,090
I imagine a traitor's wife is
very much a prostitute at heart.

47
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,070
We assault your husband,
and you still enjoy this.

48
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,730
That's not true!

49
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,860
Then why are your
nipples so hard?

50
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,670
That's... That's...

51
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,500
Michiyo...!

52
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,880
Not there...!

53
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,780
How wet you are,
down there.

54
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,850
Aren't you ashamed to be doing
this in front of your husband?

55
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,520
Please... Don't say that...

56
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:19,590
Please, take your finger out.
I can't be shamed like this.

57
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,660
Do you mean you
like what I'm doing?

58
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,600
No, don't say that...
I feel so... so...

59
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,540
You want to do it in
front of your husband?

60
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,280
No... Please...
Please take your fingers out.

61
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,290
Take them out from WHERE?

62
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,590
I... I can't say it...
Oh god, I...!

63
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,560
You're getting off on it with
your husband watching! Whore!

64
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,710
Oh god...

65
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,890
You might be a whore, but you
have such lovely pink skin...

66
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,360
I'm so ashamed...
Don't look at me!

67
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,330
That's how a whore
like you should look.

68
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,340
And now for something
a whore would crave!

69
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,740
I beg of you,
anything but that!

70
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,070
For god's sake,
not in front of my husband!

71
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:54,420
No... For god's sake, don't...!
Don't move it!

72
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,590
Michiyo!

73
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,930
Do you think it's right to lose
control in front of your husband?

74
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,110
Don't... say...

75
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,440
Michiyo...

76
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,400
I beg of you,
stop this now.

77
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,330
If you don't, you'll
shame me in the lowest way.

78
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,390
Please,
get it out of me.

79
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,670
Get what out of
where in you?

80
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,400
- I can't say it.
- Then I don't know what you want.

81
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,610
From THERE!
Pull it out...! Hurry...

82
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,410
But it's so tight in here.
I'm afraid it's caught.

83
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,980
My little son,
that is...

84
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,750
Don't say that, please!

85
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,080
Well then,
I'll pull it out.

86
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,350
No, don't!

87
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,490
Which do you want,
ma'am?

88
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,820
I don't know what
I want anymore!

89
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,770
No, don't move it!

90
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,170
Oh, the shame...
No, don't stop!

91
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,700
Am I going mad...?

92
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,840
You want it, don't you?

93
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,910
I don't know what I want.

94
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,510
Show me your tongue,
and I'll do it!

95
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,020
What should I...

96
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,800
You want it? Whore!

97
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,400
If you want it,
then ask me for it!

98
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,140
No, I can't...

99
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,300
- Then out it comes!
- No!

100
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,850
Then beg me for it!

101
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,540
Can't ask for it?
Come on!

102
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,480
More! I want more!

103
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,550
More! Harder! More!

104
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,460
Who's better?
Me or that old fossil?

105
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,500
- I can't answer that.
- Oh no?

106
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,830
Don't stop!

107
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,560
Then answer me!

108
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,570
What should I do...
Stop moving it!

109
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,140
Yes!
You're better than he is!

110
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,040
And here's your reward.

111
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm... OH GOD!

112
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,550
What is it?

What is it?

124
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,720
A ghost!
The ghost of Masago!

125
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,460
In the parlance of your times,
a bio-computer.

126
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,160
"Bio... computer...?"

127
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,410
This was me, 50 years ago.

128
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,110
I was working on an electronic
code decryption device...

129
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,410
...on orders from the military.

130
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:51,080
But that same military blew
up my lab, murdered me...

131
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,360
Accused me of being a spy!

132
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,100
But that wasn't all!

133
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,160
Matsubara, a captain in the
military police, raped my wife!

134
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,500
Before my very eyes!

135
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,170
And then, a miracle!

136
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,010
My mind, rotting and melting away,
filled with growing hatred...

137
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,110
...merged with my
electronic creation.

138
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,090
I evolved beyond
organic matter.

139
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,790
Then, that thing they dug up
outside of Norikazu's house...

140
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,350
Was my new form!

141
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,900
However, in order to initialize
the bio-computer I'd become...

142
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,460
...it was necessary to run an
activation program.

143
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,470
You mean...!

144
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:41,870
Yes! It was Norikazu
Hanyu who ran it!

145
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,710
But, once fully operational,
even the knowledge that...

146
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,310
...my wife and Matsubara were
dead couldn't wipe away my rage.

147
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,280
And now I encounter
my wife again...

148
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,880
...with her soul reborn
into a beautiful young girl.

149
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,860
You mean me?

150
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,400
I do!

151
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,770
Now, let my anger
be slowly assuaged!

152
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,170
Wander hell
for all eternity!

153
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,080
A hell from which
there is no escape!

154
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,930
What the hell...

155
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,250
Pretty lame, pal.
Finished so soon?

156
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,520
You new here? I thought
I knew everyone here in hell.

157
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,450
Hell?!

158
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,860
You know, you're kinda cute.
Wanna have some fun?

159
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,460
"Fun...?"

160
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,980
C'mon,
let's do it.

161
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,150
Doesn't that feel good?

162
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,200
Owww!

163
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,000
Midori!

164
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,470
Norikazu-

165
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,280
Midori, don't get me wrong.
I, er, well, that is...

166
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,650
Norikazu, you JERK!

167
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,280
You lecher! I hate you!

168
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,120
Midori, it's not
what it looks like!

169
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,950
...and that's
what he said.

170
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,830
So, that head is Dr. Masago's
anger, given form.

171
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,600
And you're the reincarnation
of his wife...

172
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,300
Norikazu, I'm scared.

173
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,000
Don't be.
I'm here with you.

174
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,710
Norikazu...

175
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,040
Midori...

176
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,980
Oh, enough with the
hearts and flowers already!

177
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,180
You think that's gonna
help you live in hell?!

178
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,920
She's right. We can try our whole
lives and never get out of here.

179
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,550
Midori, don't cry.
There's gotta be a way out.

180
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,860
There is. If you get
the key to unlock hell.

181
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,890
Where do we find it?

182
00:16:52,970 --> 00:17:01,070
Well now... If you both
pass a test, I'll tell you.

183
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,470
What sort of test?

184
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,560
A demon lives in that cave there.
Bring me his horn.

185
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,790
Meanwhile, me and lover boy'll
be having some fun.

186
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,890
You've got until I make
him blow his load.

187
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,230
Come back before he goes.

188
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,790
Hang on, Norikazu!

189
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,110
Big deal.
I don't see a demon in here.

190
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,120
A girl... I smell that
special place on a girl!

191
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,990
That's no demon!
It's a monster!

192
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,030
My name's Kingan.

193
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,440
You're pretty cute.
Wanna marry me?

194
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,420
Oh, piddle, piddle.
Naughty girl!

195
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,110
No! Let me go!

196
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,050
Let me go!

197
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,770
Yum...
So, wanna do it?

198
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,130
You've gotta be kidding!
We're the wrong size!

199
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,170
I can fix that,
no problem!

200
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,670
No, make yourself smaller.

201
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,910
Like this?

202
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,180
No, smaller. Or else
you won't fit inside.

203
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,110
Now?

204
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,180
More!
Smaller than me, even!

205
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,020
Good enough?

206
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,070
- What's this?
- S&M.

207
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,040
"S&M?"

208
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,440
Everyone does it
in the human world.

209
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,480
We tie each other up,
hit each other with whips...

210
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,210
Drip candles on each other,
drink each other's piss...

211
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,950
Ow! That's tight!

212
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,530
Thank you so much!
You are a true hero!

213
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,500
He's controlled us in the Niveling
tribe for thousands of years!

214
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,540
Please, eat his horn!

215
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,770
Eat this?

216
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,800
If you do, he'll be your slave
for the rest of his life!

217
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,850
That's the law of this world!

218
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,850
And if he ever disobeys his master,
he'll melt away and die!

219
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,950
Stop it! Don't tell her!

220
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,590
Sounds like fun.

221
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,000
Don't you like this?

222
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,910
Y = A X + 4...

223
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:29,210
Hey, why don't you dump the girl
and leave hell with me?

224
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,350
Even if we go to the human world,
I'm sure you'll be just fine...

225
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,820
X squared, where...

226
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,720
Here? Or here?
Or maybe do it inside me?

227
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,290
Midori...
Forgive me!

228
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,030
Kingan?

229
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,270
Norikazu!

230
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,470
Midori!

231
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,570
Put me down, Horny.

232
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,640
I said my
name was Kingan.

233
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,880
Norikazu!

234
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,140
Midori!

235
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,220
Ate your horn, didn't she?
You asshole.

236
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,920
It's humiliating!
I was born in hell...

237
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,720
...but got done in by
an itch in my crotch!

238
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,220
You promised!
Tell us where the key is!

239
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,030
Oh well...
Kingan, transform!

240
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,620
Right.

241
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,670
This is the key to hell?

242
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,670
Quick! Let's get back
to OUR world!

243
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,370
No, we've got something
to do before that. Look!

244
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,850
Unless we destroy it,
we'll never have any peace.

245
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,750
But how?

246
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,690
By saving Dr. Masago.

247
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,630
If he doesn't die, then that
thing will never be born.

248
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:53,790
Can you take us back to Japan,
50 years ago, and then home?

249
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,770
Only if I can
come with you.

250
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,360
You...!

251
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,670
Your loss, then.

252
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,040
No, please!

253
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,580
Put it in.

254
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,910
"Put it in?"

255
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,210
The key, you moron.

256
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,550
Oh, right.

257
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,260
No, like I
showed you before.

258
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,190
Sorry.

259
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,130
Now say my name.
"Eganko. "

260
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,900
Eganko.

261
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,310
What are you doing?!
Stop this!

262
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,020
What're you bastards
doing with me?!

263
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,190
Open up! Let me out!

264
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,130
Made it.

265
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,130
Ow!

266
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,330
The lab!

267
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,660
We're too late!

268
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,930
Horny, please!
Save the doctor!

269
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,570
I said my name
isn't "Horny".

270
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,480
Outta my way...

271
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,590
Got him!

272
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,830
Doctor!

273
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,500
Doctor, speak to me!

274
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,770
Who are...?

275
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,510
Thank god!
We came to save you!

276
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,110
Please, come with us.
50 years into the future.

277
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,180
50 years into the future?
What's this all about?

278
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,680
- You see...
- Norikazu, time to go!

279
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,000
Why did you save me?

280
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,130
I've been branded a spy,
almost killed.

281
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,700
My wife was raped
in front of me.

282
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,710
Why should I go on living?

283
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,950
Of all the ungrateful...?!

284
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,350
We save his ass and
he bitches about it!

285
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,850
Shoulda left the
old fart to rot!

286
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,120
Eganko!

287
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,960
Doctor, I know how
you must feel...

288
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:11,230
...but we aren't just saving you,
but a girl as well!

289
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,060
What do you mean?

290
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,000
Midori here is the
reincarnation of your wife.

291
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,340
She's related to her?

292
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:27,440
The N3-C became your ghost, seeking
vengeance, when you died inside it.

293
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,180
And it hates Midori for
being your wife, reborn.

294
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,180
I see...

295
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,190
But this way,
the ghost will never be born.

296
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,090
AII's well that ends well.

297
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,540
My house! I never thought
it'd look so good!

298
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,610
We're finally back?

299
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,550
That's better.
I was smotherin' in there...

300
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,250
More S&M, huh?

301
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,300
You're a jerk, Horny!
A stupid little JERK!

302
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,500
This is Japan 50 years
in the future?

303
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,900
It looks like the capital
after an air raid.

304
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,910
No shit. Not that
different from hell, really.

305
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,530
What?!

306
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,390
How...
How did this happen?

307
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,320
Kazuya! Sue!

308
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,330
- It's Midori and Norikazu!
- You made it back!

309
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,300
What's going on?
What happened here?

310
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,800
HE happened.

311
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,940
But, that's impossible!
How can he exist?!

312
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,740
He just suddenly showed up
and started nuking the city.

313
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,490
You were born from my death.
How can you exist here?

314
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,870
Crossing 50 years, your anger
was amplified again and again.

315
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:05,230
It crossed space and time
to allow my existence.

316
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,240
Disgusting creature!
You're a twisted mind...

317
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,510
...without a shred of
humanity or compassion.

318
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:17,210
I am merely an unembellished
reflection of your soul.

319
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,780
You're what?! If you really
represent my soul...

320
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:25,260
...then why do you hate my wife's
reborn spirit within that girl?

321
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,620
I loved my wife!

322
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,630
No, you hated her!

323
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:37,470
More than the man who raped her,
you hated your wife.

324
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,110
The wife who said
she preferred him to you!

325
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,020
Let the hatred
grow within you!

326
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,950
The hatred I've tasted
for five decades!

327
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,030
No, don't!

328
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,530
Yes...
You're better than him!

329
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,790
You're better than him!

330
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,430
Everything is my fault...
What do I do now?

331
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,480
How do I set it right?!

332
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,750
What's eating you, Pops?

333
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,410
You look like you just
ran into Death himself.

334
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,820
I've a favor to ask.
Will you hear me out?

335
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,830
What do you think
will happen to us?

336
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:49,930
It'll be okay. I said I'd beat
that thing, so don't worry.

337
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,170
He's no match for
the great Norikazu!

338
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,950
Thank you, Norikazu.

339
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,860
Be gentle...

340
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,380
Norikazu!

341
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,220
Aw man...

342
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,630
Midori...

343
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,180
Midori, you're incredible!
So tight...!

344
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,190
No, stop!
Don't say it like that!

345
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,490
Norikazu...
It feels so good...

346
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,460
It's embarrassing, but...
I wanna do it, too!

347
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,430
Oh god! Oh god! I...!

348
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,370
Midori.

349
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,340
Midori, I'm going to...

350
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:35,410
No! Just hang on
a little longer!

351
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,250
But you're
pumping so hard!

352
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,120
Don't talk like that!
It's just how my legs are!

353
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,890
Midori, I can't hold it!

354
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:58,830
Norikazu, I... I...!
OH GOD!

355
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,570
Midori...

356
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,310
Norikazu...

357
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,540
Eganko!

358
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,510
What are you doing?!

359
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,050
Well, I was bored sitting
here all by myself.

360
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,350
Huh? Where's the doctor?

361
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,290
Here.

362
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,880
He had me send him
back to the past.

363
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:57,860
August 6, 1945...
Why would he want to go there?

364
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:02,300
Who knows? I just did
what he asked me to.

365
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,000
Cheer up, he was
just a useless old man.

366
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,700
What's he up to?

367
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,310
Send me back!
To the same place. NOW!

368
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,180
Alright.
You don't have to yell...

369
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,680
Okay, how was it spelled?
H... I... R...

370
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,110
I'm going, too!

371
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,320
O... S... H...
Should I go with you?

372
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,530
No, don't.
Just pull us out in 30 minutes.

373
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,260
I... M... A... Not my problem
if you run into trouble, then.

374
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,370
What's wrong?

375
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:48,580
I just sent away
my favorite boy toy!

376
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,930
What are you doing here?

377
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:18,310
We had Eganko send us back.
What are you doing back here?

378
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,780
I...

379
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,750
Hey, that round
building over there...

380
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,280
This looks like...!

381
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,590
Hiroshima.
August 6, 1945.

382
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,430
You're going to lure it here to
destroy it with the atom bomb!

383
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,290
It's too dangerous!

384
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,770
You'll have to think of
some other way to destroy it.

385
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,100
Come back with us.

386
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:48,630
Eganko will be pulling
us out in 30 minutes.

387
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,730
It's too late.

388
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,640
The bomb will be
dropped before then.

389
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,210
Doctor!

390
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,760
You?!

391
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,130
We meet again.
I believe I owe you something.

392
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,670
What?!

393
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,370
What are they?!

394
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,450
Midori!

395
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:32,580
And now I'll have your
woman again. Look well!

396
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,420
Midori!

397
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,960
Who are you?!

398
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,760
Eganko!

399
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:53,000
That'll teach you!
Without me, you're dead!

400
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,040
Help us!

401
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,880
Oww...

402
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,210
You won't interfere!

403
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,380
Kingan!

404
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,610
Horny!

405
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:17,220
I keep telling you,
my name is Kingan!

406
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,370
Gratuitous, wasn't it?

407
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,210
Doctor!

408
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,250
Doctor!

409
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,880
- Norikazu, get in!
- Can you fly that?

410
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,020
Hey, after all the virtual
flight sims I've played...

411
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,390
...a fighter like this is
a piece of cake!

412
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,570
You don't have to come!
You can fly by yourself!

413
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,200
Nuts to you!

414
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,000
Oh, jeez...

415
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,300
For crying out loud!

416
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,960
Doctor, think it over!
It can't work!

417
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,730
Of course!
You want to die with it!

418
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,100
You can't!

419
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,070
Doctor, we don't
do that anymore!

420
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,570
It's for the best.

421
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,440
I created it,
and I'll destroy it as well.

422
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,440
Let me put an end
to all of this!

423
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,980
Doctor...!

424
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,080
The Enola Gay...

425
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,850
The plane with
the Hiroshima bomb...

426
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,360
Doctor!

427
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:10,330
No matter where you run,
you cannot escape me!

428
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,380
Come to hell with me!

429
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,770
This world's
way worse than hell.

430
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,940
No shit...

431
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,240
Doctor...

432
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,120
Time to go home.
