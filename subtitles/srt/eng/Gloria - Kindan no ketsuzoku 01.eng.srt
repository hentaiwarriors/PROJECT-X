1
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:44,466
House of the Forbidden Fruit

2
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,520
Well? Have you found them?

3
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,489
Yes, Mother. They are surprisingly close.

4
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,053
The blood runs true.

5
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,562
It seems they are at the top of
their class at the university.

6
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,531
Perfect. I want you to proceed immediately.

7
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,302
I thought you'd say that.
I'm already on my way.

8
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:13,068
Then we will be returning
tomorrow afternoon, so...

9
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,208
Understood.

10
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,555
Hey, Kira, did you do something
to get called on the carpet?

11
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,159
Who knows?

12
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,391
No idea? Didn't lay a finger on
the professor's grandchild?

13
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,899
Quit it. You were the one who
made her cry, remember?

14
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,560
I just gave her advice.

15
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,728
Gave her advice and then ate her anyway.

16
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,930
It's my nature to savor the
delicacies put before me.

17
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,415
No matter what...

18
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,882
...be prepared for it.

19
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,752
Because of the generous donation,

20
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,721
it's just a matter of confirming your
choice of graduate students.

21
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,616
Then it is all right, is it not?

22
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,688
Well, here they are.

23
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,900
Miss Eterna Gloria, let me introduce you.

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,664
Kira of Akushi and Beowulf Heine.

25
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,238
Really? These two?

26
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,277
The Gloria family.
Do you know them?

27
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,713
Well, the name ranks high among
the world's richest families.

28
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,477
An invitation from that distinguished family...

29
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,018
Basically, this is the proposition:

30
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,722
As you two are consistently at
the top of your class here,

31
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,782
the Gloria family is asking you
to be their tutors.

32
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:45,189
I can't refuse such a beautiful,
commanding lady. Can I, Kira?

33
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,801
I am asking for the sake of
my younger sisters.

34
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,065
My own education has nothing
to do with this.

35
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,740
My mother will be returning to
the house tomorrow morning.

36
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,407
If you are interested, we ask that you
visit at that time.

37
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,575
Eterna Gloria?

38
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,716
She seems to be a very rigid person.

39
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,585
She's a fine woman, isn't she?

40
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:10,352
Women who are on guard like that
set my soul on fire.

41
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,286
It's my nature to savor delicacies
that aren't put before me.

42
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,363
See ya!

43
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,033
Miss?

44
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,901
I have decided that I shall undertake
to be your tutor.

45
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,365
I do not need one!

46
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,076
Well, let's get going.

47
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,844
You are a forceful person, are you not?

48
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,005
Don't you like forceful men?

49
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:38,651
No, I don't!

50
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,379
Cecil! Cecil, Sister!

51
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,471
What's wrong?

52
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,385
Oh no! Really? A tutor?

53
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,920
Don't make me laugh.

54
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,264
Who is that?

55
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,765
He's supposed to be Miss Eterna's tutor.

56
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,307
Hey, what about my teacher?

57
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,775
He's supposed to arrive tomorrow.

58
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,279
I wish he'd hurry up and get here!

59
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,988
Wow! What a huge house!

60
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,956
Please do not raise your voice.

61
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,026
Don't worry about it, Eterna.

62
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,095
I do not remember giving you leave
to use my first name.

63
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,655
You'll call me "Teacher", right?

64
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,268
Kira, this will be a super feast!

65
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,685
Yes, that's right.

66
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,690
It was so sudden, yesterday that...

67
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,486
Lisa?

68
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,425
Yes!

69
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,327
Is my teacher here?

70
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,589
Not yet.

71
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,565
I wish the teacher would get here.

72
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,625
I was so excited last night
that I couldn't sleep!

73
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,326
Madam hasn't returned yet, so please
wait in your room.

74
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,241
I'll notify you when they arrive.

75
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,208
Okay!

76
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,646
Assuming that they arrive safely.

77
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,911
That's it! I thought of something good!

78
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,921
I'm so smart!

79
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,683
Excuse me...

80
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,756
Are you Mr. Kira of Akushi?

81
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,460
Yes, I am.

82
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,066
I got it right then? Wow, I'm great!

83
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,562
And you are?

84
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,598
I'm Cecil. Please call me Cecil.

85
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,342
I've come to pick you up.

86
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,144
Sorry! It seems I'm late.

87
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,384
I...

88
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,015
Sorry!

89
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,489
Shall we leave then?

90
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:40,555
Yes!

91
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,772
I'm surprised it's a Volvo.

92
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,535
It's because they're very sturdy.

93
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,884
Mr. Kira, is it all right if I drive?

94
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,252
Of course.

95
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,189
Are you ready then?!

96
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,156
Ready?

97
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,791
Well, here I go!

98
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,931
It's okay. Volvo's are very sturdy.

99
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,699
It's not that!

100
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,166
They're very sturdy!

101
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,112
I understand why you were late.

102
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,580
Yes, I'm driving very safely.

103
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,609
You are?

104
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:39,986
That's funny.

105
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:40,748
Yes?

106
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,046
That car's following us.

107
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,956
That's creepy, isn't it?

108
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,294
Slow down a little. Let them pass us.

109
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,761
Yes! I understand.

110
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,068
That's the gas!

111
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,136
I'm so sorry!

112
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,195
Cecil, the wheel! The wheel!

113
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry!

114
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,555
It's not that I don't like these things,

115
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,319
but I don't think it's the right thing
to do while driving a car.

116
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,932
Mr. Kira, they're hitting us!
They keep hitting us!

117
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,601
Cecil, spread your legs and
lift up your skirt!

118
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,262
What? But that's...

119
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,767
Hurry!

120
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:37,741
Here!

121
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,227
Who are they?

122
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,668
Mr. Kira, you...

123
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,296
Cecil?

124
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,967
Isn't there something you should
take care of?

125
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,745
Oh no!

126
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,688
Announcing the arrival of Kira of Akushi.

127
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,565
I hear Kira's here.

128
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,328
Yes, they've just arrived.

129
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,671
Yes, it seems they failed.

130
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,969
Yes, I should observe them in detail, right?

131
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,806
Then excuse me.

132
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,625
That those two would let men into
the Gloria mansion...

133
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,300
Are they thinking of making them
their successors?

134
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,731
No matter who may intervene, this city
will fall into my hands.

135
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,364
And the Gloria family too.

136
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,271
Welcome.

137
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,250
We were saved, because the Volvo
is such a sturdy car.

138
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,519
It's strange that you were involved
in such trouble.

139
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,688
It was my fault!

140
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,349
You just be quiet.

141
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,794
Are you all right?

142
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,595
I can't believe I did that.

143
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,164
Please sit down.

144
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:38,858
Yes.

145
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,096
Maybe you're a bit tired?

146
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,636
Perhaps.

147
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,006
How do you feel about the
tutoring proposal?

148
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,471
Please accept it.

149
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,379
I would have to meet the girls first.

150
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,851
Madam.

151
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,554
Is that so?

152
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,625
It seems that my eldest daughter
has another tutor,

153
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,786
so I will entrust the other four to you.

154
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,095
Four?

155
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,158
I don't mind if you include me as well.

156
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,235
I was just jesting.

157
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,441
Cecil, please escort Mr. Kira.

158
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,142
Yes!

159
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,610
You've got bad manners, Miss Maid.

160
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,106
What scheme are you cooking up?

161
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,648
Me? Nothing!

162
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,774
Come on!

163
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,856
Why were you listening?

164
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,058
Nothing!

165
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,694
That's a lie, isn't it?

166
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:48,522
Since I've been here, I've seen you
acting strange many times.

167
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,233
What are you hiding?

168
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,580
You don't have to say if you don't want to.

169
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,551
But in time, you'll want to.

170
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:20,594
Wow! You're Japanese!
That makes me happy!

171
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:26,001
Mister, as a sign of our new friendship,
have a drink!

172
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,834
Naomi is from Sai.

173
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,980
Sai? Oh, you mean Saitama, right?

174
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,784
Come on now, don't say it that way!

175
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,853
You mean Miss Naomi is adopted?

176
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,888
Yes, that's the way it is.

177
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,891
Everyone except Miss Eterna is adopted.

178
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,993
Well, let's have a drink!

179
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,961
Well, just one.

180
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,099
Whoa, can you drink!

181
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,169
Hey, another one! That way...

182
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,330
Naomi, you're drinking too much.

183
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:01,873
Chance!

184
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,640
A big exhibition!

185
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,113
What?

186
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,080
Miss Naomi!

187
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,216
No!

188
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,218
There's no reason for you to work, Mister!

189
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:16,555
Cecil likes it when you do this!

190
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:17,522
No!

191
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,925
Gotcha!

192
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,228
Cecil!
Tickle, tickle!

193
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,329
Sister?
Tickle, tickle!

194
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,797
Gitchee, gitchee goo!

195
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,234
See! She feels hot when someone sees her.

196
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,768
No, that's...

197
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,861
You're so wet!

198
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,635
No! Don't say that!

199
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,737
No!

200
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,573
When you start crying out like that,
I feel so strange.

201
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:52,413
Say, you like stuff like this, right?

202
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,231
Look! You're sopping wet.

203
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,596
No! Stop!

204
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,230
Please stop, Naomi! I'm embarrassed!

205
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,238
Stop it, already!

206
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:06,939
Ouch!

207
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,907
Cecil doesn't want to!

208
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,376
There's no one that "doesn't want to".

209
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:19,775
Oh well, so I'm a slut and
a drunk, so there!

210
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:27,018
But, Mister, I like your type!

211
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,303
Is Miss Naomi always like that?

212
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,861
Well, yes.

213
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,308
You're one of the daughters of
this house too?

214
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,741
Yes, I'm the second daughter.

215
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,542
Why are you dressed as a maid?

216
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,576
It's my punishment.

217
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,349
Punishment?

218
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,087
It's okay! I kind of like dressing like this.

219
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:55,921
Cecil!

220
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,388
Yes, Miss Eterna?

221
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,124
Have you seen Beowulf?

222
00:15:59,124 --> 00:15:59,886
No.

223
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,685
It's time to study. What is he doing?

224
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,998
Does he intend to abandon his position

225
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,363
when he was the one to volunteer for it?

226
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,902
No, he isn't the type to leave
someone like you alone.

227
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,478
What was that?

228
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,347
Tell me. Won't you tell me what
you're hiding?

229
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,426
I'll tell you. I'll tell you,
so please...

230
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,188
Tell!

231
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,302
Forgive me!

232
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,732
Beowulf, what are you doing?

233
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,111
Yo, Kira! You want some too?

234
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,919
You are the worst kind of man.

235
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:22,065
With Lisa?! How beastly!

236
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,627
Cecil, bring her a blanket.

237
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:52,599
Yes!

238
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,476
Mr. Kira is so kind.

239
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,291
Oh no! The teacher might be here already!

240
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:31,302
My other sisters are Mary and Charm.

241
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,245
But this doesn't seem like a good time,

242
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,803
so I'll introduce you to them later.

243
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,080
Were you surprised?

244
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,146
You mean about Mr. Beowulf?

245
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,079
But Mr. Kira was so kind.

246
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,524
Cecil, you don't have to do that.

247
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,698
Yes, I do.

248
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,162
I've been told to take care of
your needs, Mr. Kira.

249
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,236
But you're a daughter of this house too.

250
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,040
No, I want to do it.

251
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,271
You're a strange lady, aren't you?

252
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,510
Yes!

253
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:14,043
Dinner's ready. Please come to
the dinning room.

254
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,347
I'll come right away.

255
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,450
Mary!

256
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,685
Mary, we looked all over for you!

257
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,419
I was sleeping in the flower garden!

258
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,397
Teacher?

259
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,033
Yes?

260
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,737
Here! For you!

261
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,543
They aren't so fresh any more.

262
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,636
They weren't supposed to be like this.

263
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,739
Don't worry. If you give them some water,
they'll perk up.

264
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,042
Really?!

265
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,521
Yes, really.

266
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,389
Mary, it's time for dinner.

267
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,196
I'll call Mr. Beowulf.

268
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,431
Thank you for earlier.

269
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,937
I didn't do anything.

270
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,540
No, someday I will return the favor.

271
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,581
Please excuse me.

272
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:26,484
Charm! Charm, it's time for dinner.

273
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,191
She must be really tired.

274
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,728
Mr. Kira!

275
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,266
Mr. Kira, please wait in the dining room.

276
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,927
Is this area off limits?

277
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,670
No, it's not that.

278
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,573
But it might be a little dangerous.

279
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,736
Charm!

280
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,570
Who is it?

281
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,515
It's time for dinner.

282
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,516
I don't need any.

283
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,677
Well, do you have any need of a tutor?

284
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,978
What? A tutor?

285
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,346
I don't need one!

286
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,458
We'll save that for later, but you
have to eat dinner, or...

287
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,194
I'm really busy right now!
Don't bother me!

288
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,769
There, there. You're a good baby.

289
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,277
Plymouth?

290
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,407
Mr. Kira?

291
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,885
Cecil, are you afraid of this baby?

292
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,853
It's all right. Baby's got a cute face.

293
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,093
Is that so? Charm's still busy?

294
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,560
Really.

295
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,394
She just got back from South Africa.

296
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,704
You know it's dangerous to
push her too far.

297
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,907
Naomi!

298
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,512
Maybe I got a bit drunk?

299
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,884
Cecil, please take Charm something
to snack on later.

300
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,545
Yes, Madam.

301
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,349
By the way, Mr. Kira, how did it go
with my daughters?

302
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,588
They are all intelligent ladies, so I
don't know who to teach first.

303
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,763
Hey, don't beat around the bush!

304
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,129
You have to decide soon,
or you'll seem rude!

305
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,135
Tonight's dinner doesn't suit my tastes.
Excuse me!

306
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,643
Excuse me for just a moment.

307
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,444
Teacher?

308
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:34,046
Teacher what about me?
I'm first, right?

309
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,182
That's right. Why don't we start tomorrow?

310
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,321
Tomorrow?! I'm looking forward to it!

311
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,534
So, this is Charm's room.

312
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,843
Password: Charm

313
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,317
I didn't think so.
It wouldn't be that easy.

314
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,581
Well, let's go at it for real then.

315
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,414
Assuming all the rooms are networked,
Michelle's room...

316
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,962
What tight security.

317
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:30,736
Here it is!

318
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:33,936
This is...

319
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,175
The data for the Gloria family's estates?!

320
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,245
Such a young woman is handling this?

321
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:55,162
It seems Charm is a special member
of the Gloria family.

322
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,170
For some reason, she's trying to hide that.

323
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:06,972
It's odd that they chose
grad students as tutors.

324
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,517
Yes? What is it?

325
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,153
Cecil?

326
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,723
What brings you here in the
middle of the night?

327
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:19,883
Did something happen?

328
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,393
If it's all right with you...

329
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:28,594
I wondered if you would like to
have me with you at night?

330
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:35,736
Of course, that's only if you wish,
Mr. Kira, but...

331
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,803
Cecil...

332
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:54,047
No, Mr. Kira, please be still.

333
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:55,786
Cecil...

334
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,688
Mr. Kira!

335
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,692
How can you be so self-sacrificing?

336
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,365
It's just because I like you, Mr. Kira.

337
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,864
This is saying, "I want it."

338
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,006
Please don't say it that way.

339
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,110
Do you want me?

340
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,577
Yes, I do. I want Mr. Kira to be in me.

341
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,488
Come here, Cecil.

342
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,062
Mr. Kira...

343
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:51,438
Put it in me, Mr. Kira, again and again.
Deeper and deeper!

344
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,572
Cecil...

345
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,784
Mr. Kira. Mr. Kira!

346
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,092
Mr. Kira, you have to stay with us, okay?

347
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,855
There, right there.

348
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,527
I feel so...

349
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,801
Mr. Kira! Mr. Kira!

350
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,031
I feel like I'm going to melt, Cecil.

351
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,413
I'm coming!

352
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:50,468
If you want to see the rest of the dream

353
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:55,997
Approach me carefully

354
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:03,581
The moon rules the night sky

355
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:09,178
It enfolds both of us

356
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,958
In its tender beams

357
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,162
Forever

358
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:22,566
Tears scatter into the night

359
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:30,475
Please hold in your hands

360
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:36,948
The future that will be someday

361
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:43,455
The dream I saw last summer

362
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:50,028
The shining road I followed

363
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,264
If I am with you

364
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:56,434
I can walk it

365
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:59,738
Believe in me

366
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:06,439
With your whole heart
