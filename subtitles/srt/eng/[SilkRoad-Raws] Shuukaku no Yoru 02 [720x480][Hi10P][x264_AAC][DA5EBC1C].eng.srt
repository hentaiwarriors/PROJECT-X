1
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:08,747
Honoka!

2
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:10,447
Come on! Honoka!

3
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:14,558
Hey there, Masato!

4
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:18,320
Treat the patient gently, will you?

5
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:22,900
Aren't you the doctor?

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,163
Can't you do something?

7
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:27,404
Masato.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,045
Let's go.

9
00:00:35,382 --> 00:00:36,508
Honoka.

10
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:39,448
Don't push yourself too hard.

11
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:40,846
I'm fine.

12
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:43,552
Honoka.

13
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:45,953
She wants to go home.

14
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:48,085
Why don't you take her back home?

15
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:52,193
We've got no home to go back to.

16
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:56,730
Masato.

17
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:04,343
The Harvest Night

18
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:08,036
Episode 2: Ashes in the Urn

19
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:13,509
It's not like I'm sad.

20
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:16,012
It's not like I want to cry.

21
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:20,457
It's just that I don't want to be
reminded of that time.

22
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:24,697
I just want to fall asleep quietly.

23
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:27,127
At that time around here.

24
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:32,134
Absolutely helpless.

25
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:34,240
I can't even protect my only sister.

26
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:38,142
Around here, there were
so many dandelions.

27
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:40,409
When there was a breeze...

28
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:42,804
It was...

29
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:46,049
It's you, Emi.

30
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:48,450
Hey, Masato.

31
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,088
Silvery cotton balls
danced across the sky.

32
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:53,921
Your mind's totally with Honoka.

33
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:56,722
Can't you look at me sometimes?
I'm cute too.

34
00:01:57,164 --> 00:02:00,065
In the middle of them stood that girl.

35
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,293
It was all a dream. Just a dream.

36
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,010
Master, isn't this girl good?

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,740
Set a good price, will you? Please?

38
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:26,720
Unfortunately, she's already
experienced, I believe.

39
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:30,160
Too bad. I was sure
Ryoko was a virgin.

40
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:39,931
Let's see.

41
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,140
Some sort of used underwear
and urine like everyone else.

42
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:47,306
Girls with spectacles
are popular right now...

43
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,676
so if she appears in a video...

44
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:53,516
No. I don't want to.

45
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:58,424
- Because Ryoko, you're so cute.
- You'll sell a lot.

46
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:01,654
Very well, please sign here.

47
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:03,894
But...

48
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:05,163
No, don't!

49
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:08,200
Ryoko, you're not doing that.
I'm telling you.

50
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:09,961
Honoka.

51
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:15,664
Hey brat, will you stop interfering?
This is mine.

52
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:17,533
Hey, Honoka!

53
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,051
What about mine?

54
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:35,623
Masato prohibited me
from using yours.

55
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,863
It's not my fault even if Masato gets upset.

56
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,031
No, don't! Honoka!

57
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,635
Be quiet, Ryoko.

58
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:50,471
Honoka!

59
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:53,142
Come on, Honoka!

60
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:54,779
Honoka!

61
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:02,881
Honoka shocked me.
Can't believe it.

62
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:06,615
Even Masato's no match for that.

63
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:10,657
Stop talking about Masato when we're at it.

64
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:15,064
It's because you can't do anything, Shinji.
I'm the one who's got to work.

65
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:19,036
Stop pinching my tits so hard!

66
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:22,565
Don't get mad, Lisa.

67
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:25,042
I'll make sure to comfort you nicely.

68
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:00,075
But, you know...

69
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:02,272
Masato's acting weird of late.

70
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:07,415
Forget that.

71
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,215
Just continue, will you?

72
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:11,916
Can't you wait a bit?

73
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:19,087
What an appetite, Lisa.
Even your asshole's wet.

74
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,457
Come on in.

75
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:38,045
Just as usual, yours is really tight.

76
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:43,311
Shinji, hold me tight. I'm scared.

77
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:45,554
I'm really scared!

78
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,692
You mean, Masato?

79
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:50,819
No, of this town.

80
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:53,558
Lisa.

81
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:58,135
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,969
Don't need to apologize.

83
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,590
Shinji. Shinji!

84
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,218
It's good.

85
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:34,029
Shinji, it's good, really good.

86
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:39,168
Shinji, I can't. I can't, I'm coming!

87
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:40,303
I'm coming!

88
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,394
Hey, Masato.

89
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,897
Of late, you're not involved
enough, don't yeah think?

90
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,171
Don't feel like it.

91
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:10,669
You mean, we're not going to take
that job tonight?

92
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:11,774
What?

93
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:15,071
That's going to work out
to be a real problem.

94
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:21,851
Haven't you heard,
the other gangs are getting a lot bigger.

95
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:25,348
Without Masato, it's uncomfortable.
It really is.

96
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,723
Unless we make our presence known,
they'll take advantage.

97
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:38,827
So, will you please, Masato,
will you come with us?

98
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,869
No, thank you, very much.

99
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:46,645
We can't count on you anymore.

100
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:55,086
Ryoko.

101
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:04,294
Don't tell my brother about that, okay?

102
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:06,226
I wouldn't really want him to know.

103
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,001
Yes, of course, I understand.

104
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,398
If I did, who knows
what will become of Lisa.

105
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:19,269
Honoka, please don't do that again.
Promise me.

106
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,108
Are you worried about me, Ryoko?

107
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:24,108
Thanks.

108
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:31,212
You know...

109
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:35,386
I thought I'd take Masato
and go across that bridge.

110
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:44,864
Please keep your promise.

111
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:47,732
Like you said:

112
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:51,936
I was jealous of you
because you could go near Masato...

113
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:53,774
without hesitating.

114
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:04,179
I didn't know how strong
the bond was...

115
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,185
between the two of you.

116
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:12,687
After all, I didn't know
anything about him.

117
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:18,164
Why are you crying, Ryoko?
We're already dead, you know?

118
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:29,611
Let go of me!

119
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:32,480
Let go of me, damn it, no!

120
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:36,113
No! Don't, no!

121
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:39,091
Shinji!

122
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:45,386
Shinji!

123
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:51,900
Motherfuckers!

124
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:54,599
Fuck all you bastards!

125
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:56,408
Fuck you!

126
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:03,310
Don't do that!

127
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:06,179
It hurts!

128
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:07,410
Stop it!

129
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:12,046
Without Masato, you guys are nothing.

130
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,432
Thanks for taking care of Wakaba.

131
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:27,902
No, don't, please!

132
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,235
Shit!

133
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:36,243
Don't you dare resist me!

134
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,440
Stop, it hurts!

135
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:40,982
Leave her alone.

136
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:44,222
Don't you dare touch Lisa!

137
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:46,790
What a nice pair.

138
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:51,726
Don't you look away! Here.

139
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,322
Stop it.

140
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,640
Leave her alone!

141
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:07,303
Take it in, deeper!

142
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:09,770
More!

143
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:17,044
More tongue.

144
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:23,451
All of it!

145
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,828
You're pretty good at it, aren't you?

146
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:34,664
You bitch!

147
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:38,377
Do you think it's that easy?

148
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,308
You fucking bitch!

149
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:43,646
What's that?

150
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:48,153
No, don't!

151
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:51,289
- Get away from her!
- Please, don't!

152
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:02,329
She'll get tighter.
That's fun! Right, guys?

153
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:07,169
Please, no!

154
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:16,174
What's wrong?
You're bored with your stupid talk?

155
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:20,741
Masato...

156
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:25,246
I know you want me dead.

157
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:35,996
What are you going to do?

158
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,128
Let's have fun, Lisa.

159
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,264
No, please don't!

160
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,583
No!

161
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,846
Stay away from her!

162
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:04,026
Just stop it!

163
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:06,564
You're too loud!

164
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,197
An unruly bitch has got to be
treated like this.

165
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,703
Stop it! You pervert!

166
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,245
They're all out late.

167
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:06,257
It's okay even if they don't return.

168
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:07,185
What?

169
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:11,992
After all, none of us can leave this town.

170
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:17,135
What do you mean?

171
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:33,142
It's all your fault, Masato!

172
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:34,479
Why didn't you come with us?

173
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,349
Will you tell him too, Honoka?

174
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:48,824
I'm leaving this town with Honoka.

175
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:52,199
Masato.

176
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:54,367
I know you're lying.

177
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:57,007
There's no way you'll leave us
behind and desert us.

178
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:58,471
You know I mean it.

179
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:00,872
You can't change my bro's mind.

180
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,651
Lisa's gone.

181
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,288
Agei, Shima and lzumi are dead too.

182
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,458
- Honoka! What's wrong?
- Honoka!

183
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:20,122
I knew you'd be back.

184
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:25,032
With this, there'll be no one
out there that can scare you.

185
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:28,501
I really hope so.

186
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:32,910
I wonder if Honoka's okay.

187
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:34,542
Worried?

188
00:15:34,614 --> 00:15:38,482
But of course without Honoka,
you won't be able to leave this place.

189
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:42,985
That's not...

190
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,617
What are you talking about?
It's kind of too late, you know.

191
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:52,553
Ryoko...

192
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,891
Please, Emi, let go of me, please.

193
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:00,296
Don't say that.
Let's have some fun, Ryoko.

194
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,332
Honoka.

195
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:12,581
Not here.

196
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:14,447
Let's go, Honoka.

197
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,587
Ryoko!

198
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:23,823
Be careful.

199
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:25,853
Who's there?

200
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,245
No, Ryoko!

201
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:45,472
Emi.

202
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:48,786
Masato, you're a little late.

203
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:51,450
What did you do to her?

204
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:54,821
She seemed so lonely,
we all played with her.

205
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:58,787
I'm okay, I'm okay...

206
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,989
I'm okay, I really am.

207
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:12,474
No, no, no, Ryoko, why?
I haven't done anything yet?

208
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:14,511
Why did you go there alone, Ryoko?

209
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:17,980
We agreed that you wouldn't.
Tell me, why did you do this?

210
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,817
No need to cry.
I'll let you join her, Honoka.

211
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:24,378
So she says.

212
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,585
Don't touch Honoka!

213
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,023
Masato!

214
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:33,725
Don't move.

215
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:36,731
Here!

216
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,233
Don't think you're the big shot anymore.

217
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:43,438
But I won't kill you right away.

218
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:46,239
First, you've got to taste
the pain that Lisa tasted.

219
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:12,434
Masato, make sure you watch
this real well.

220
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:22,103
How smooth an inexperienced
girl's skin feels.

221
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:25,579
Her smallish boobs get me excited.

222
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,679
Let me see what she's like down below.

223
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:31,516
No, don't!

224
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:35,153
I bet she can feel a lot.

225
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:39,453
Her tits are hard and excited now.

226
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:44,530
She's getting wet down here, too.

227
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:48,367
I'll bet she's a virgin, too.

228
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:49,772
Of course!

229
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:52,409
With Masato protecting her like that.

230
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:58,674
We'll know as soon as we stick her.

231
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:02,283
No don't, please don't.

232
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:05,287
Look, how pretty down there.

233
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:08,849
There's a big difference
between hers and yours.

234
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:13,698
- You idiot! Shut up.
- Masato, please help me!

235
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,927
Honoka!

236
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:19,469
It's no good, Masato.
Will you just lie low?

237
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,755
No this'll make me mad.

238
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,532
Masato!

239
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:10,378
What a surprise!

240
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:13,022
She's got it in her pretty good.

241
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:18,224
It's about time for the real thing.

242
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:19,855
Did you hear, Masato?

243
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:24,026
Your precious sister's going to be a woman.
Watch that real well.

244
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:33,911
What's this?
She's not a virgin?

245
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:36,581
What a disappointment.

246
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:39,673
Not a virgin?

247
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:43,016
Then, Masato, what were you
protecting her for?

248
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,921
She's pretty tight.

249
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:53,224
Feels good, you know?

250
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:07,072
It's about time.
Let me try her too.

251
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:08,510
You perverts.

252
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:36,069
Just don't worry about anything,
and do her till she breaks apart.

253
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:50,652
It's enough!

254
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,191
It's too soon to be over.

255
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:07,097
We're not done yet.

256
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:13,868
It's not satisfying yet. Right, Lisa?

257
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:44,235
She's tightened.

258
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:46,570
Same here.

259
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:53,242
What the...

260
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:56,181
- Is she okay?
- How pathetic.

261
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:57,983
Why are you all scared now?

262
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:00,587
But she's not acting normal.

263
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:05,830
She might be dead.

264
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:09,628
That's fine. Now we don't
have to deal with it later.

265
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:10,991
Fuck!

266
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:14,770
I thought we'd have a lot more fun.

267
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:18,968
We'll throw you down the bridge.

268
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:20,840
All three of you together.

269
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:25,376
You must be happy, Ryoko.

270
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:29,043
Good bye, Masato.
It was fun doing it with you.

271
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:34,249
What?

272
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:37,089
Masato.

273
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:39,587
Hey, wait a sec!

274
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:45,797
No, Masato.

275
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:47,565
Don't come near me!

276
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:05,219
You fucking monster!

277
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:09,351
You fucking bitch!

278
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,712
Let's go, Honoka.
Let's go home now.

279
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:45,128
It's not like I'm sad.

280
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:48,059
It's not like I want to cry.

281
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:53,494
It's just that I don't want to be
reminded of that time.

282
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,207
I just want to fall asleep quietly.

283
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:03,243
At that time all around here...

284
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:06,947
there were loads of dandelions.

285
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:09,951
When there was a breeze...

286
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:14,317
silvery cotton balls danced
across the sky.

287
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,918
In the middle of them stood that girl.

288
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,432
It was all...

289
00:25:25,871 --> 00:25:27,839
just a dream.
