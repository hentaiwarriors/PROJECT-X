1
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:18,824
Where are my glasses?

2
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,498
Linia...

3
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,729
Good morning, Sayaka.

4
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:51,129
You slept late.

5
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,394
G-Good morning.

6
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:58,632
Good morning, Sayaka.

7
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:00,632
Good morning, Linia...

8
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:04,704
Misuzu, I thought you
went to bed late last night.

9
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,610
No.

10
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,708
It wasn't very late, because
there was a sudden blackout.

11
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:11,718
Blackout?

12
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,547
Didn't you know?

13
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:15,212
N-No...

14
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:19,326
W-What's up?

15
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:22,356
What were you doing with Linia?

16
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,994
A-Aki is not up yet, right?

17
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:28,558
I'll go to wake her up.

18
00:02:28,904 --> 00:02:30,132
If you are talking about Aki...

19
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:35,532
If you are talking about Aki,
 she went outside with Lui.

20
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:41,444
Misuzu doesn't pay attention to me...

21
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:43,478
...ever!

22
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:45,982
Whatever human beings or androids...

23
00:02:46,188 --> 00:02:49,021
...she can't keep her
hands off any cute girl.

24
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:53,588
Really, what's wrong with her eyes?

25
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:57,031
There is a beautiful girl right here, right?

26
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:00,225
Ouch!

27
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,332
Hey, wait!

28
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:05,230
I won't forgive you!

29
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:10,475
I feel stupid...

30
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:17,977
Misuzu...

31
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:41,036
Misuzu...

32
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:44,338
Misuzu...

33
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:00,419
Misuzu...

34
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:23,479
W-Who?

35
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:29,049
W-What...

36
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:33,852
O-Ouch!

37
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:35,462
L-Let go!

38
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,822
Leave me alone!

39
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,027
Let go!

40
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,593
You are cute...

41
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:19,037
No!

42
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:32,518
Here's the old man...

43
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:34,555
I mean, this is our guy.

44
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:35,953
Linia, you know him?

45
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:38,052
No, but...

46
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:40,319
Maybe I just don't remember...

47
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:45,255
Misuzu, what is this
''Complete Chip Outline''?

48
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:50,937
I guess it outlines a Chip that was
abandoned after problems in development.

49
00:05:51,606 --> 00:05:53,130
A-Again?

50
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:55,742
Give me a break.

51
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,404
It blacked out last night
when I was researching, too.

52
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,879
It's strange.

53
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:01,743
Were the cords unplugged?

54
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:06,276
You are careless sometimes,
so maybe you forgot something.

55
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:07,716
Linia!

56
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:12,492
Linia, you can hear me, right?

57
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:14,792
Don't try to escape anymore.

58
00:06:15,397 --> 00:06:18,025
Give me the Complete Chip.

59
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:22,030
Otherwise, there will be trouble.

60
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:23,795
Who are you?

61
00:06:23,938 --> 00:06:26,930
What do you mean
by the Complete Chip?

62
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:31,178
That's Lui.

63
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:32,235
What happened?

64
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:36,213
What's that?

65
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:39,620
Wait, what's going on?

66
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:45,520
A-Aki!

67
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:51,557
Aki.

68
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:52,065
Aki!

69
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:52,792
Aki!

70
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:53,925
Aki!

71
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:56,237
Aki, you are alive, right?

72
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:58,202
Wake up, Aki.

73
00:06:58,273 --> 00:06:58,932
Aki!

74
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,004
Aki, you okay?

75
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:00,905
Aki!

76
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,908
M-Misuzu...

77
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:07,371
Aki!

78
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:08,311
That's awful!

79
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:10,248
Who did such an awful thing?

80
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:12,181
Anyway, we have to
take her to the hospital.

81
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,085
Misuzu, help me.

82
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:14,917
All right!

83
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:22,257
Did you understand?

84
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,858
I'll tell you once more...

85
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:26,993
Give me the Complete
Chip without saying a word...

86
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:31,169
Don't escape or resist like last night.

87
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:35,633
Otherwise, the other
two girls will look like that.

88
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:37,211
Linia!

89
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,842
What are you doing, Linia?

90
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:41,313
Call the hospital, right now.

91
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:42,974
And get the first aid kit!

92
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:43,710
Yes.

93
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:57,287
It doesn't work, no matter what we try.

94
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:58,889
The phone circuit is broken.

95
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,905
Not only the phone, but the
electricity doesn't work as well.

96
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:08,476
Everything is because
of that android, isn't it?

97
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:12,239
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

98
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:16,377
I can't believe that Aki
was hurt because of me...

99
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:18,513
What should I do?

100
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:20,986
No, it's not your fault.

101
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:26,023
Anyway, the android really
said "Complete Chip," right?

102
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:27,189
Yes...

103
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:30,958
And she said I did
something last night...

104
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,928
You've done something?

105
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:36,494
Is that related to the Complete Chip?

106
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:38,000
Did the phone work?

107
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:40,571
No, I don't think so.

108
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:41,609
Okay.

109
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:45,578
Then we should drive
down to the hospital in the city.

110
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:47,974
Sayaka, please go with them.

111
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:49,943
What are you saying?

112
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:51,485
You're coming with us.

113
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:52,781
No, I can't.

114
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:53,786
I'll stay here.

115
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:55,345
Then I'll stay here, too!

116
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:56,653
Okay...

117
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:59,488
I'll take her to the hospital.

118
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:02,019
I'll be back as soon as possible.

119
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:05,292
Lock the doors up tight.

120
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:07,425
Yes, please be careful.

121
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:28,412
Linia, let's have tea.

122
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,253
Well, thank you but, I can't...

123
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:34,253
It's okay...

124
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:35,557
It's just this feeling...

125
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,730
...that I don't want tea by myself...

126
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,398
I'm really sorry.

127
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:44,399
Everything is my fault.

128
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,364
That's enough.

129
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:49,842
I just want to stay with you.

130
00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:51,737
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:57,173
By the way, did you remember
anything about the Complete Chip?

132
00:09:57,252 --> 00:09:59,345
I wanted to talk about it.

133
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:03,747
Misuzu said there was a
blackout last night, right?

134
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:04,382
Yes.

135
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,959
Maybe I'm the cause of that.

136
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:14,224
That kind of thing happened before...

137
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:27,503
After that, it happened again and again.

138
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:31,443
It's a defense mechanism,
which you can't control consciously.

139
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:35,475
Maybe it is, but for me it's not...

140
00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:10,213
Wait here until I dispose of Linia.

141
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:22,654
I see!

142
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:28,259
Dr. Zen finished the
Complete Chip ten years ago!

143
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:32,434
You were the trial
product that was mounted with it.

144
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:35,872
I was the trial product...

145
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,408
That means, Dr. Zen made me...

146
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:42,279
I'm sure.

147
00:12:42,683 --> 00:12:45,481
Efficiency of the
Complete Chip is very good.

148
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:50,022
Androids like you are
difficult to make, even today.

149
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:54,360
However, the
Complete Chip had a secret.

150
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:57,495
Robots with the Chip react...

151
00:12:57,565 --> 00:13:00,762
...when put under certain stresses...

152
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:05,597
...by shorting out or destroying
electronics, as you experienced.

153
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:10,969
So, it's possible that there are some
dangerous people, who want to abuse it.

154
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,240
They are the ones after you now.

155
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,817
I can't believe it.

156
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:19,176
I'm scared.

157
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:22,450
I have such a thing inside of me...

158
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:29,857
But, if everything
you said was the truth...

159
00:13:30,598 --> 00:13:33,999
...then I should never have been made.

160
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:38,931
A machine that
destroys other machines.

161
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:44,335
An android that can't
help humans be happy...

162
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:47,308
T-That's not true, Linia!

163
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,309
I think Dr. Zen hid you for ten years!

164
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:56,584
He wanted to guard you
from people who want the Chip.

165
00:13:56,924 --> 00:14:04,228
It was the feelings Dr. Zen had that
made him put you to sleep for ten years.

166
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,101
I like you, Linia...

167
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:14,196
Sayaka...

168
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:57,215
Linia, you look so wonderful.

169
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,380
You shouldn't...

170
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:44,460
Linia...

171
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:39,743
Linia...

172
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:43,515
Sayaka, I'm already...

173
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:46,224
Please come here...

174
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:27,293
Sayaka...

175
00:18:29,964 --> 00:18:33,195
S-Sayaka, I love you...

176
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:37,363
Me too, Linia, I love you...

177
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:00,485
Sayaka...

178
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:12,865
Linia.

179
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,109
Linia!

180
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,072
Hold Lui and hide behind the couch.

181
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:24,814
Right now!

182
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:10,859
Please don't follow me!

183
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:14,526
I told you not to oppose me.

184
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,912
Linia!

185
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:51,335
You've been wasting my time, it's over.

186
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:54,703
Give me the Complete Chip.

187
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,163
No!

188
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:36,446
Linia!

189
00:21:57,171 --> 00:21:58,934
Are you ready, Linia?

190
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:02,408
I can't give the Complete Chip to them.

191
00:22:02,743 --> 00:22:04,768
I'll keep you from them.

192
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:05,977
Master...

193
00:22:08,882 --> 00:22:14,718
Linia, I made you sad
because of my thoughtlessness.

194
00:22:15,189 --> 00:22:19,353
At least, I want to
know that you will be safe...

195
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:26,557
...ten years from now
when you awake in the future.

196
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:35,371
This will protect you
when you next wake up.

197
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:39,976
But, it will also block your memory.

198
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:45,345
If that's what you want, it's okay.

199
00:22:45,953 --> 00:22:47,784
I'm sorry Linia.

200
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:54,661
I'm happy that I have you
stored away in my memory...

201
00:22:54,762 --> 00:22:56,787
...even if I can't remember.

202
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:01,727
Good bye...

203
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:06,001
Master, be safe...

204
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:14,745
Master...

205
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:18,341
Your defense mechanism worked.

206
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,178
Yes...

207
00:23:28,896 --> 00:23:30,329
Is she broken?

208
00:23:30,998 --> 00:23:34,399
No, I just interrupted her functioning.

209
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,472
Lui, because of you...

210
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,978
Thank you...

211
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:51,684
Sayaka, I must find my Real Master.

212
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:54,516
His name is Dr. Zen.

213
00:23:55,756 --> 00:24:00,455
I believe my Real
Master is alive somewhere.

214
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:03,525
I have to look for him.

215
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:09,231
I want to thank him for everything...

216
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:11,635
Linia...

217
00:24:11,872 --> 00:24:15,603
I'm really happy that I
was able to meet you.

218
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:25,583
Linia, can I see you again?
