1
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,700
You're finished already?

2
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,607
That didn't do it for me.

3
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,739
Yeah, but at least it's
better than last time.

4
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,176
Listen, Madam...

5
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,248
if you really want
to hold onto this inn...

6
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,822
you need to do a lot better than that.

7
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,418
You're on the brink, you know...

8
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,586
No!

9
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,564
No!

10
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:43,520
SWALLOWTAIL INN
1st Night

11
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,729
SWALLOWTAIL INN
<i> </i>

12
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,269
I am the proprietor
of the Swallowtail Inn.

13
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,371
My name is Yuriko Shiratori.

14
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,916
It was a lot classier
before, don't you think?

15
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,521
The food isn't what
it used to be, either.

16
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,255
Ever since I lost my husband,
who previously ran the inn...

17
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,525
the business has been falling apart...

18
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,892
and I'm having a hard
time staying afloat.

19
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,908
The most serious set back is the
loss of our best chef, my husband.

20
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,841
Our cuisine has suffered considerably.

21
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,717
With things the way they
are, I can't really blame our...

22
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,719
...regular customers for staying away.

23
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:47,150
But I just don't have the
money to hire a new chef.

24
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:51,554
It's all I can do to
keep my head above water.

25
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:06,678
All I can do is try to handle
what I can and hope for the best.

26
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:09,974
I can't...

27
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,941
I can't even do this right!

28
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,633
I'm the most pathetic woman...

29
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,470
Ma'am!

30
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,648
Oh, it's you, Harumi.

31
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,884
You're supposed to be taking it easy,
you shouldn't be running like that.

32
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,147
You have to come, quick!

33
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,724
What happened? Are you all right?

34
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,159
Stay with us, now...

35
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,401
Are you all right?

36
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,732
Maybe you hit yourself when you fell...

37
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,706
No, I'm all right.

38
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,050
Oh, I'm sorry.

39
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,822
Please, get some rest now.

40
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,874
What?

41
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,345
That's right. I can't
remember who I am at all...

42
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,946
Do you think it's amnesia?

43
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,952
I have no idea how I came to be
lying there when you found me.

44
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,392
How awful for you...

45
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:11,131
If you'd like, you could stay
here until your memory comes back?

46
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,301
You mean you'll take me in?

47
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,438
But you don't anything about me...

48
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:22,378
I don't mind that at all. I'm sure
that you ended up here for a reason.

49
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,376
Thank you very much.

50
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,376
I feel so relieved now, it's
made me hungry all of a sudden.

51
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,545
Well, then, enjoy your meal!

52
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,215
Thanks, I will.

53
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,067
This seems like a venerable inn.

54
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,403
Actually, we haven't
been around for that long.

55
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,506
Oh, I'm sorry, it just seems so rustic.

56
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,912
I thought that was just
a statue of a monkey!

57
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,423
You don't have to do that!

58
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,356
No, no, I have to do
something to earn my keep.

59
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,932
Now for this side!

60
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:19,532
Something was about to change.

61
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,431
That's the feeling I got, and
it made my heart skip a beat.

62
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,941
You're very good at that.

63
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,411
No, it's nothing.

64
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,950
The mistress told me that she didn't
know what she'd do without you.

65
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,750
She's letting me stay here for free.

66
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,845
If it's within my reach,
I'll do whatever she needs.

67
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,117
You too, Harumi. Let me know
if there's anything I can do.

68
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,093
Then, when I think of something,
I'll be counting on you.

69
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,125
You have to promise me!

70
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,962
It looks beautiful.

71
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,341
Is there nothing you can't do?

72
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,309
It's really strange...

73
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,870
For some reason, I
know exactly what to do.

74
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,217
Maybe you used to work
ata hotel or an inn...

75
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,407
Oh, no...

76
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:09,812
Itcan't be...

77
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:10,951
Now, then!

78
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,084
We have to come up with a name for you.

79
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,853
Oh, that's right...

80
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,456
Anything's fine, as long
as it's easy to remember.

81
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,962
Then, how do you feel
about the name Kenji?

82
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,625
Kenji?

83
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,396
Yes, using the characters
for "health" and "govern"...

84
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,166
Kenji...

85
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,477
It's a good name. I think I like it.

86
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:33,976
Kenji...

87
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,476
Yes.

88
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,482
Excuse me, do you have a minute?

89
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,209
Sure.

90
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,884
It doesn't open.

91
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:43,716
I know...

92
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,684
This outdoor hot spring
is just going to waste.

93
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:47,823
I know.

94
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,791
It's probably not my place to say this...

95
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,558
...but this isn't going to
help you to attract customers.

96
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,534
This place always used to be packed...

97
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,369
I know that I have to
do something about it...

98
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,531
...but the money just isn't there...

99
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,006
To tell you the truth,
I can't understand...

100
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,471
...how you're managing
to stay open atall.

101
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:13,381
Well that's none of your business!

102
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,216
I'm sorry, I was out of line.

103
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,789
So was I, I didn't mean
to speak so harshly.

104
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,225
Please forgive me.

105
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,422
It's true, there's a secret behind
the Swallowtail Inn's finances...

106
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:33,338
Something I don't want anyone
to find out, if possible...

107
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,840
I should serve them some tea.

108
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,471
No, it's just a casual gathering.

109
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,282
But still...

110
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,747
You don't have to do
anything for them, please.

111
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,984
That's strange, they didn't
even show their faces.

112
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,456
Uh-oh...

113
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,201
Why don't we play a
little roulette today?

114
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,236
Good idea, we haven't
done that in a while.

115
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,204
All right, then, Madam,
we're counting on you, now!

116
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,502
It would be damn nice to win for once!

117
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,176
That should do it.

118
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,919
Which room's next door?

119
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,227
All right, next!

120
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,243
Shit, I was almost there...

121
00:10:49,243 --> 00:12:23,037
So you saw everything.

122
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,267
By accident.

123
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,675
I wasn't planning to watch, and
I wish I hadn't seen anything.

124
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,278
But now everything's clear.

125
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,750
That's how you're able to
keep this place running!

126
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,812
But it's so crazy! You're
turning this place into...

127
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:37,719
Stop it!

128
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,918
My husband built this
inn from the ground up.

129
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:45,293
I'll do whatever it
takes to keep it open!

130
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,689
Whatever it takes!

131
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,912
Please, don't you think
I've been humiliated enough?

132
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,037
Come here, Kenji...

133
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,576
Kenji is inside me now, running wild.

134
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,508
How did this happen?

135
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,479
Because I saw something of
my late husband in his face?

136
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,553
I don't have an answer for that myself.

137
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,921
All I know for sure is that I
could tell instantly that this man...

138
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,487
...this man was someone I
could rely on for everything.

139
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,864
I can't hold it in any
longer, I'm going to come!

140
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,109
So am I!

141
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,578
Come inside me, please! Kenji!

142
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,347
Yuriko!

143
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,578
Kenji!

144
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,184
I know you must be appalled with me...

145
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,488
No, I was too shallow-minded.

146
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:00,428
But now I understand how much you're
putting yourself on the line for this inn.

147
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,433
I want to do whatever I can to
help you keep this place running!

148
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,335
Thank you so much, Kenji...

149
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,908
I felt as though I
had 100 men on my side!

150
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,850
What do you think?

151
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,846
It's hard to say...

152
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,085
What's that?

153
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:33,062
We were trying to imitate one
of my husband's famous dishes...

154
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,166
...but it's not quite...

155
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:40,766
If we could put it back on the menu, that
would do something for our reputation.

156
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,098
Does it have a name, or something?

157
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,039
Yes, we call it "Sasame-Yuki".

158
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,474
Sasame-Yuki?
Sasame-Yuki?

159
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,474
I know I've heard that name before...

160
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:55,985
Kenji!

161
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:57,823
I'm fine!

162
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,350
I'm all right!

163
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,248
What's this?

164
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:35,191
I don't know, my body just
started moving on it's own...

165
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,691
You did a wonderful job.

166
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,395
Kenji, you must've worked
as a chef somewhere...

167
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,134
I don't know about that...

168
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,271
I wondered if that was a sign that
Kenji's memory was starting to return.

169
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:51,002
It made me happy, butat the
same time it also made me sad.

170
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:56,638
Kenji continued to work hard, never
once cutting corners in any way...

171
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,149
...from fixing up the inn to
preparing meals in the kitchen...

172
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,347
and training me as an "entertainer".

173
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:18,665
Not yet!

174
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,293
What?

175
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,841
You're too self-conscious.
Let's go outside to the garden.

176
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:32,318
You're too self-conscious.
Let's go outside to the garden.

177
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,285
Louder, now!

178
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,683
I'm so embarrassed...

179
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,254
Ow!

180
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,289
That's the problem!

181
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,430
That's why you can't raise your voice!

182
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,297
You have to shout it out so
they know how you're feeling!

183
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,899
That's right, that's the way!

184
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,199
Move your hips more!

185
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:57,637
Right...

186
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,313
Is this all right?

187
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:07,316
I want you to lurch
backwards when you yell.

188
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:10,486
More!

189
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,919
That's right! Yuriko, enjoy yourself!

190
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:18,161
Your customers won't enjoy themselves
unless you're enjoying it too!

191
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,196
I've always been so
embarrassed until now...

192
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,493
So ashamed, and so full of guilt...

193
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,200
Well, you're not that person anymore!

194
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:29,532
Yes!

195
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,042
Yuriko! This is amazing!

196
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,449
I'm going to come!

197
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:06,679
And once in a while something like
this took place for our customers.

198
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,591
It scares me so...

199
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,023
the thought that I
might never get well...

200
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:06,666
that unless I do, I'll
be left behind, all alone...

201
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,981
I don't want to be alone and lonely...

202
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,285
I want someone to be there by my side...

203
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:04,428
Someone who will comfort
me, that was all I wanted...

204
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,773
I never knew that someone
else's touch could be so warm...

205
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,847
I'm coming!

206
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,789
I'm going to come now!

207
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:53,205
I know it was a lot to ask.
Thank you for granting me my wish...

208
00:21:56,482 --> 00:22:03,012
After Kenji took over the kitchen,
our reputation slowly began to improve.

209
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:12,822
Soon, there'll be enough money to make
those repairs on the outdoor hotspring!

210
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:13,830
That's great!

211
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:17,025
If we can get that done now, it'll be
ready in time for the winter season.

212
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:20,866
Thank you so much, Kenji!
If it hadn't been for you...

213
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,002
No, I haven't really done anything...

214
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,882
Hello, this is the Swallowtail Inn...

215
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,087
Well, now, what a surprise...

216
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,040
I'm going to come!

217
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,590
Just the thought that one more push...

218
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,165
...and we'd get the Swallowtail
Inn back on track to profitability...

219
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:25,363
that was enough for me to do
even more practice sessions.

220
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,298
I want you to take a good look at these.

221
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,868
They all look the same...

222
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,408
...but I've cut each of these sushi
items into different sizes by type.

223
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,472
Let's start with the fatty tuna.

224
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,080
Next, thread fin.

225
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,119
Sea eel.

226
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:44,653
Shrimp.

227
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,079
Abalone.

228
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:47,390
Egg.

229
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,485
Halibut.

230
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,362
Now I'm going to mix them up.

231
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,823
No, it's going too deep...

232
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,301
No, stop, it's going in too far!

233
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,211
No, please, too far!

234
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:09,781
I know, you're going
to eject them yourself.

235
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,012
All right, start with the thread fin.

236
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,788
O-Okay.

237
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,556
This is the abalone.

238
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,861
I'm sorry.

239
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,635
Oh, that was the wrong one, wasn't it?

240
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,012
I could tell after I'd
started, let me try again!

241
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,376
You did it!

242
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,380
Did I really?

243
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,220
Now remember how you did that...

244
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,887
Yes!

245
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,388
All right, now eject
the rest, one by one...

246
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,605
Now I'm going to clean you up...

247
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,189
Is this all right?

248
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,158
Yes.

249
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:36,434
Hey! I'm getting a really great view.

250
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,730
Oh, please, don'tsay that...

251
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,036
A-All right, I'm going to start.

252
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,380
Well, now, you're treating
us to a sushi bar, are you?

253
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,249
You're adding a new dimension, eh?

254
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,414
I'd like to try that too.

255
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:09,424
I have to say the Madam's new
techniques are something else.

256
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:13,697
I know, seems like she's had some
kind of breakthrough or something...

257
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,135
She's improved a hell of a lot...

258
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,755
I was able to give my
customers so much pleasure...

259
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,358
...and it was all thanks to Kenji!

260
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,995
Um, what do you think?

261
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,599
Should I grind harder, or not?

262
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,566
No, that's fine, I'm
just about to come anyway...

263
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,334
N-Now!

264
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,620
Yuriko, you've really
gotten good at this.

265
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,248
Thank you for saying that.

266
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:14,524
They say that if you time it just right
and suck as hard as you can at the...

267
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,999
...moment of ejaculation, you
get several times the pleasure!

268
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,373
Uh... excuse me?

269
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,035
Fuyuka?

270
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:27,908
Fuyuka!

271
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,477
That's my younger
sister, Fuyuka Shiratori.

272
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,112
I have no idea what's
in store for us now.

273
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:41,653
All I know is that my head is
whirling and my groin is drenched...
