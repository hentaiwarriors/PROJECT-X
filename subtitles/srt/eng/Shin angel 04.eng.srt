1
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,740
Shizuka!

2
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:27,423
Guess who!

3
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:30,134
You're so bad, Kousuke.

4
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,751
Oh, no! Kousuke!

5
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,818
Now, let's eat!

6
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,287
It's delicious!

7
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:13,719
That was our chef’s famous
hamburger-steak.

8
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,046
Next, we'll introduce you to one of
the most delicious ramen houses

9
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:20,027
in the Ginza district, right
after this commercial.

10
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:34,729
New Angel 4
A Bride for a Week

11
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:45,730
Something's not right.

12
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,554
Usually by now,
supper is on the table

13
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:50,891
even though it's not always
the greatest.

14
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:53,446
Wait a minute.

15
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:56,000
Last night, I had dinner delivered,

16
00:01:56,052 --> 00:01:58,398
and this morning, I overslept,
so I didn't get any breakfast.

17
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:01,005
I had lunch at the school's cafeteria.

18
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:02,517
That means...

19
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,062
Mom hasn't been home
since last night!

20
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:17,011
Geez, Mom! What is she doing leaving
her starving son here alone?

21
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,177
What's up, Shizuka?

22
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:29,992
Good evening.

23
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:31,765
Anyway, come on in.

24
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:34,684
It wasn't raining when
I left my house, and...

25
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,585
Kousuke?

26
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:40,419
Yes?

27
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:44,016
My clothes are soaked, so is it
alright if I change here?

28
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,083
What? Get changed? Why do you have
a change of clothes with you?

29
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:50,064
Don't look.

30
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,358
Sorry!

31
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,387
Let's see... Let's start with the laundry.

32
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:04,506
Laundry?! Why do you have
to do it at my house?

33
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:07,634
The laundry room is down this hall.

34
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:11,752
Oh, yeah! Kousuke! How long have
you had on that underwear?

35
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:15,037
These? Two days, I guess.

36
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:18,426
Hey! Stop!

37
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:22,440
What are you thinking,
taking off my pants?

38
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:25,724
Wait a minute! You shouldn't be
doing this so fast. Shizuka!

39
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:28,592
Let's do washing, washing.

40
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:41,626
Oh, no. My panties are soaked too.

41
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:49,289
Oh, shoot! I left all my spare clothes
in my bag by the door.

42
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:49,863
Hey!

43
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:53,304
You've been watching me
all this time! Pervert!

44
00:03:58,257 --> 00:04:00,290
What does all this mean?!

45
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,854
What does all this mean?

46
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,086
You came into my house,
tore off my pants,

47
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:07,224
and in the chaos, you grabbed
my very important part!

48
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:11,082
I didn't! I didn't grab it!

49
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:16,817
Have you heard anything from
your parents or my parents?

50
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:19,006
Heard what?

51
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,395
Oh well, what sorry parents I have.

52
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:27,817
Okay, I'll explain it to you if you bring
me that bag from the hallway.

53
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:33,760
Are you listening to me?

54
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:43,041
Hello, Atami residence.

55
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:47,733
Collect call from Mrs. Shiho Atami.
Will you accept the charges?

56
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,861
A collect call? Yes, I'll accept it.

57
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:53,624
Hello, Kousuke!

58
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:56,961
Hello?! Are you going to starve
your own son to death?

59
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,577
Aloha!

60
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,643
Aloha?! Mom, where are you?!

61
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:05,198
You know where. We're in Hawaii.

62
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:08,222
I told you. Your dad won
a jackpot on the horses,

63
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,767
so we went on vacation.

64
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:13,800
Or did I forget to tell you?

65
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:16,250
The two of you went to Hawaii
after winning a jackpot?

66
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:22,037
Also, Mr. and Mrs. Himenogi's daughter
will be staying with you for a week.

67
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:26,730
All the details are in the letter
I gave her, so ask her about it.

68
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:28,502
What did you say?

69
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:31,317
Oh, well. I think she's much
more alert than you are,

70
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,706
so I don't think there'll be any
problem, but be careful anyway.

71
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:37,991
Kousuke! Don't do anything crazy!

72
00:05:38,043 --> 00:05:39,451
Honey!

73
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:42,631
I'll call you later!

74
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:44,560
But what am I going to do?

75
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:51,702
Man, this sucks! They just left and
didn't tell me anything! Damn!

76
00:05:51,754 --> 00:05:53,162
Some parents!

77
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:56,499
If that's the case...

78
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,897
That's strange...

79
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,077
I've got it! Kousuke must have
hidden it somewhere!

80
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:12,713
So, Shizuka and I will be together
under the same roof.

81
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:17,353
Well, it that's how it is...

82
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,793
Seeing this beautiful girl constantly...

83
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:27,623
How I can hold back my throbbing
teenage hormones!

84
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,595
Kousuke!

85
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,340
According to Shizuka,

86
00:06:57,392 --> 00:07:01,094
her father suddenly had to go
to London on a business trip,

87
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:05,734
and for some reason,
her mother went along.

88
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:12,772
Well, I hope you like it.

89
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:21,374
I spent a long time to cooking this.

90
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:23,460
You could eat it with
a bit more passion!

91
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:26,640
What time is it?

92
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,745
I'm sorry it took so long.

93
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,508
Would you get me some sauce?

94
00:07:41,342 --> 00:07:42,750
Yes...

95
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,518
Here...

96
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:01,883
Idiot!

97
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,173
No bra or panties in front of a man...

98
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,656
Well, you know, someone hid my bag.

99
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:17,784
Do I have to sleep like this?

100
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:20,652
It's in the shoe drawer!

101
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:24,093
Oh, I see.

102
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:30,818
I'm going to take a bath since
I'm soaked with rain.

103
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:53,132
Aren't you supposed
to be taking a bath?

104
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,947
Hey, Shizuka!

105
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:02,725
I hope all goes well, Kousuke.

106
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:08,251
Six more days of living alone together.

107
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,498
How long are you going to sleep?!

108
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,346
That's blinding me! It's Sunday!
Can't I sleep a little more, Mom!

109
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:29,366
Shizuka! Why are you in my room
with only a negligee on?

110
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:34,788
I accidentally brought my mom's
negligee instead of my pajamas.

111
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:36,873
I'll go get them later.

112
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,532
Here are your clothes!

113
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:53,139
I can't get that flash of her boob
yesterday out of my mind.

114
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,651
She should've been more considerate.

115
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,562
These are...

116
00:10:09,614 --> 00:10:11,647
Too small for me.

117
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,723
I guess she's not here.

118
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:22,543
The room my mom used when she first
married has become Shizuka's room.

119
00:10:23,638 --> 00:10:27,809
To actually be living with a girl
I am so interested in...

120
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:37,975
Surely it can only get better!

121
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:41,155
And of course, I want to be with her!

122
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:48,402
The situation is almost like
God telling me to go for it!

123
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:50,487
Today is Sunday.

124
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,260
I should approach her slowly,

125
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:54,815
and I am going to do it!

126
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:56,274
What?

127
00:10:56,744 --> 00:10:59,403
Kousuke, what are you doing in here?

128
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,436
Oh well, I mean the pool...

129
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:06,180
Yeah, I was going to ask you if you
want to go swimming with me.

130
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:45,542
Hey, Kousuke!

131
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:47,888
Hey, it's Sakai!

132
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:51,590
Hey, it's Himenogi!

133
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:56,282
Hey, is that your new one?

134
00:11:57,637 --> 00:11:59,462
How long have you been together?

135
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:02,642
Hey, Kikuchi.

136
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:05,093
You dropped something.

137
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:10,984
What? You live with that boy?

138
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:19,013
I'm so jealous! My nipples get
hard just thinking about it!

139
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:23,913
Oh, by the way, did you know that
there's straight ones and curved ones?

140
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:24,643
What?

141
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:28,814
Come on! Don't act so innocent!
I know you've done it!

142
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:31,316
His curves to the left.

143
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:33,767
Oh, that.

144
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,061
At first it was so fascinating.

145
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:39,814
Something so small and soft
becoming as hard as a rock.

146
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:43,151
And then, when it penetrated
all the way inside me...

147
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,227
I'm getting wet just thinking about it!

148
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,583
Come on, let's go!

149
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:49,094
Hey, wait Himenogi!

150
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:52,327
Since you're staying at his house,

151
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:55,820
you have to let him do it at
least once if he asks you.

152
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:58,583
At least once...

153
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,588
Oh, this water is cold!

154
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,446
This feels so good!

155
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:13,806
You're so pathetic!

156
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:18,238
She's living with you, and you
haven't fucked her yet?

157
00:13:18,968 --> 00:13:21,992
Hey, man, Kousuke Atami's
name is being ruined.

158
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:26,319
Moron! At least I'm not
like some people

159
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,508
who're low enough to do it
in an elevator!

160
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:31,324
Oh, okay.

161
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:35,599
I was going to tell you about the spell

162
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,997
that enables you to do it
with a girl for sure.

163
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:39,457
For sure?!

164
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:43,471
Master! Please punish one
who is so self-centered!

165
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,912
Sir, is that spell for real?

166
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:49,884
Himenogi!

167
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:03,178
Are you serious?!

168
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,927
I went to the pool just
to have a little fun,

169
00:14:13,657 --> 00:14:15,534
but I got some great news instead.

170
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:21,738
Shizuka! The pizza should
be here anytime now.

171
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:23,667
Do you want some juice?

172
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:25,648
Oh, sure! Thanks!

173
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:30,080
Ouch... That was the first time in
a while that I've been swimming,

174
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:32,113
and my legs are really
starting to stiffen up.

175
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:34,042
Ouch...

176
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,744
And I'm getting really stiff too.

177
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:43,322
Listen up, Atami. First, put
some juice in a glass.

178
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:45,772
Then, put your dick in there.

179
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:52,498
Then say, "she is mine" three times,
and mix well.

180
00:14:55,469 --> 00:15:01,256
She is mine. She is mine.
She is mine!

181
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:03,707
And have her drink that juice.

182
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:08,190
Her body will be yours tonight.

183
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:09,650
Everything...

184
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:11,423
Shizuka...

185
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:16,271
Yes!

186
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,850
I'm coming right now!

187
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,718
Thank you for ordering!

188
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,177
How much will it be?

189
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,618
One special pizza, and one supreme
pizza - that's 4000 yen, please.

190
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,400
Here...

191
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:42,860
Shizuka!

192
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:45,310
Here's your juice.

193
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:50,263
Oh, thank you for being so kind.

194
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,026
Not for you!

195
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,534
Thank you very much.

196
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:09,188
What's wrong?

197
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:11,482
Gross!

198
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:04,347
He really believed in that phony spell.

199
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:06,537
That's so good!

200
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,570
I wonder how he's doing now?

201
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,197
It's inside.

202
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,737
More!

203
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,278
Right there!

204
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,033
I'm coming!

205
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,996
Something's wrong with Kousuke today.

206
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:56,072
You ordered pizza, and you're
not eating any of it.

207
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,617
Did I say something to upset you?

208
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:02,537
Not really.

209
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:03,997
You don't understand.

210
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,760
No one understands my feelings

211
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,461
about not being able to be with
someone I have feelings for.

212
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:12,807
What do you mean?

213
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,092
I said that girl is not cute at all!

214
00:19:27,197 --> 00:19:28,604
You mean this girl?

215
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:31,785
How can she become a cute girl?

216
00:19:47,738 --> 00:19:49,146
Ouch!

217
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:51,492
Oh, no!

218
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:53,525
I'm sorry, Shizuka. Are you okay?

219
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,340
How pathetic!

220
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:57,800
What a sorry mistake.

221
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,772
Oh! I'll get it!

222
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,231
Excuse me.

223
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:10,156
Hello, this is the Atami residence.

224
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,511
Is that you, Shizuka?

225
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:13,493
Oh, hi, Mom!

226
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,317
How are things there? Anything wrong?

227
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:16,986
No, not at all.

228
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:20,635
Five more days of living
alone together. Oh, well.

229
00:20:21,156 --> 00:20:23,920
Hey! Today's not over yet!

230
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:30,541
Hey!

231
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,901
What is it?! What's "hey"?

232
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:39,925
Oh, it's nothing.

233
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:45,816
Shizuka, the reason we're in London
is because we're researching.

234
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,423
Marshmallow, Marshmallow!

235
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:51,395
What? Researching what?

236
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,878
We went to places where
not many tourists go.

237
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,599
And because...

238
00:20:57,651 --> 00:21:00,518
Mom, you are coming back
in one week, right?

239
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,978
Come back soon.

240
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,646
Yes, well...

241
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:05,627
Let me talk to her. Let me
explain this to her.

242
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:09,277
Hi, it's your dad.

243
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:11,519
Even though we're here
for my business,

244
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:13,343
this is more like my job's...

245
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:15,690
Hello, hello?

246
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:20,121
She hung up.

247
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,979
I hoped she wouldn't take it too hard
when she found out about this.

248
00:21:27,524 --> 00:21:28,932
Well, there's nothing we can do.

249
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:35,292
Big boob, squeeze, squeeze!

250
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:38,472
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

251
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,477
Shizuka...

252
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:49,421
Could you at least tell me that size
which can't be measured in public?

253
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:52,445
My IQ?

254
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:55,051
You know?!

255
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:01,933
I don't like this.

256
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,260
Even though you want it,
I can't help you.

257
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:10,170
I did not come to your house for this.

258
00:22:15,488 --> 00:22:17,939
I'm sorry for not being a cute girl.

259
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:37,854
That's the best I can do for now.

260
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:42,598
Shizuka!

261
00:22:52,608 --> 00:22:54,016
Shizuka...

262
00:22:55,371 --> 00:22:56,779
Kousuke...

263
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:58,500
It's only been two days,

264
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:00,794
but it's been great. Thank you.

265
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:07,623
Hey, wait a second!

266
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:23,107
Wait! Stop!

267
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,378
Why are you going home?

268
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:35,828
Being home by yourself
is very dangerous.

269
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:40,051
Won't I be a burden
if I stay with you?

270
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,762
I thought things would've
gone more smoothly.

271
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:48,341
But I guess, after all, a high
school boy and girl

272
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,800
living in the same house
is not a good idea.

273
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:53,137
I won't try anything with you anymore.

274
00:23:54,284 --> 00:23:55,692
Will you believe me?

275
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:58,038
Is it too late?

276
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:05,337
If you don't hate me, come back
with me please!

277
00:24:09,924 --> 00:24:11,332
Look! It's turned red!

278
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:16,128
I want to spend as much time
with you as possible!

279
00:24:54,604 --> 00:24:55,334
Oh, yeah!

280
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:57,159
You two are so cute!

281
00:25:14,728 --> 00:25:16,553
Cheers to our friendship!

282
00:25:16,605 --> 00:25:18,013
Cheers!

283
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:23,591
Oh, I'll get it!

284
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:33,966
Hello, Atami residence.

285
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:37,407
Oh, Shizuka. It's your father.

286
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:41,213
I'm sorry I hung up on you last time.

287
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:42,516
Oh, don't worry.

288
00:25:42,568 --> 00:25:43,976
What?

289
00:25:44,706 --> 00:25:49,137
To make a long story short, I was
assigned to the London office.

290
00:25:49,189 --> 00:25:52,370
We will all be living here in London.

291
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:56,540
That's why your mom and I are here.
We've been looking for a house.

292
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,147
Are you there, Shizuka?

293
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:01,337
I'd better repeat that.

294
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:03,370
We'll all be in London by next month.

295
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:06,029
Let's all live together as a family.

296
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:32,253
Seifuku o nuide

297
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:36,424
Kami no ribbon hodoke ba
