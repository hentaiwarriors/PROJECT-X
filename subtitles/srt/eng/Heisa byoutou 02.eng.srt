A Synopsis of Episode 1

00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,404
I'm Satsuki Aoyagi. Pleased to meet you.

3
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:11,903
I'm Naho Ota. I hope to
get to know everyone.

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:16,406
They will be starting work
today as probationary nurses.

5
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,248
Mr. Kamiya!

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,082
Good morning.

7
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,797
What's wrong, Satsuki?

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,630
What are you doing?

9
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:40,731
Such a wonderful person like him?

10
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:42,463
I can't believe it.

11
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,340
Our job deals with people's lives.

12
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,371
This is unforgivable.

13
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,080
I'll do anything. Please forgive me.

14
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,349
Really?

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,680
Yes, really.

Episode 2

17
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:06,631
PLEASE ENJOY A DIFFERENT
VERSION OF THE SAME SCENE
FROM THE PREVIOUS EPISODE.

18
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,871
This is great.

19
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,468
More... More...

20
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,827
I can't hold it any longer. I'm
going to put it in your pussy.

21
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,726
Mr. Kamiya. N... not that...

22
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:44,860
What do you mean, "No"?
You said you'd do anything.

23
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:49,000
Put your guard down and
let me open the gates.

24
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,538
Here I come.

25
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,769
You're starting to feel it.
Go ahead and enjoy it.

26
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,372
I'm going to take this
opportunity to be experimental.

27
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,197
No. I'm...

28
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:00,011
I'm the one who's
thrusting and enjoying it...

29
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,529
S... sorry!

30
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,712
I fell...

31
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:47,950
I can't walk well because it feels like
I still have something in my pussy...

32
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,787
Dr. Waka... Wait...

33
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,040
D... Doctor!

34
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,475
Don't misunderstand.

35
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,576
I'm not doing it because I care about you.

36
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,441
I'm only fulfilling my duty as a doctor.

37
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,586
Are you in love with that patient?

38
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:16,751
Huh?

39
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,589
Of course you're not...

40
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,951
...which means you're a woman
who'll sleep with anyone.

41
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,665
How could you say something like that!

42
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,463
But am I wrong? I caught you
in the act with my own eyes.

43
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,464
You were getting fucked by
that dirty middle-aged man...

44
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,409
...and screaming in ecstasy.

45
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:42,980
I'm disappointed in you.

46
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,446
I don't want to be lectured
by a guy like you.

47
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:52,748
What?

48
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,685
I heard it all from Naho.

49
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,425
You had passionate sex
with her, and the next day...

50
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,165
...you told her that you're not interested.

51
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,933

I can't forgive someone like
you, someone who'd do that!

I can't forgive someone like
you, someone who'd do that!

57
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,852
He didn't even ask why I did
it, and he presumed I'm a slut.

58
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,920
I hate Dr. Waka! Who
cares about hlm anymore!

59
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:49,237
That's terrible. I can't
forgive someone like you!

60
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:56,377
Dr. Waka. Is the student guy really that bad?

61
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,952
Huh? Yeah...

62
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,719
Is it too late?

63
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:02,559
Yeah...

64
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:07,830
Really? Poor guy, but he's still so young!

65
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,995
Doesn't it make you feel like you
should enjoy life for him, too?

66
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,836
So on that note!

67
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,010
Why don't we do something next Sunday?

68
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,278
How about a movie, or
we go on a road-trip?

69
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:28,953
I told her I'm not interested.
What is this girl thinking?

70
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:35,154
She said giving the cold shoulder to
someone who's annoying you is terrible...

71
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,353
Is that so wrong?

72
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:39,860
Excuse me.

73
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,104
Satsuki. What is it?

74
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,704
The head nurse told me to bring
you Mr. Onda's medical chart.

75
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,012
Oh, thanks.

76
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,212
Just leave it there.

77
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,621
Put it down quietly, Satsuki.

78
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,286
Sorry.

79
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,259
Please excuse me.

80
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,361
Naho. This student needs to
be reexamined immediately.

81
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,900
Please tell the head nurse to make
the proper arrangements. And...

82
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,844
I'm up for Sunday's plan.

83
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,481
Because I'm not a cold guy
like your friend tells me I am.

84
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:33,249
Huh?

85
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,179
Satsuki, wait a...

86
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,019
Dr. Waka.

87
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,957
I hate to be redundant, but you just
promised me a date on Sunday.

88
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,436
What was that just now?

89
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,672
What happened between you and Dr. Waka?

90
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,209
Something happened, right?

91
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,776
The friend he was referring
to could only be you!

92
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:05,514
You have no right to say anything
about what's going on between us!

93
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,477
I already told you from the get go!

94
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,583
Are you listening? Why
are you being so quiet?

95
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,753
If you didn't have anything to hide,
you wouldn't be acting this way!

96
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,621
What do you have to say for yourself?

97
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,758
Nothing happened. Aren't you happy?

98
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,832
You have a date on Sunday.

99
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,961
Do you honestly think I'm happy
because I have a date, thanks to you?

100
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:36,505
What's wrong?

101
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,514
My stomach...

102
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,017
Oh no... What am I going to do?

103
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,756
Have Dr. Takebayashi look at you.

104
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,176
Dr. Waka has no idea how I feel.

105
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,506
If Naho wants the idiot, she can have him!

106
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,585
Leave me alone!

107
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,882
What are you saying? You have to
stay in bed like the doctor said!

108
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,059
Shut up!

109
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,624
Why are they making such a
scene? They need to shut up!

110
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,564
Excuse me. We can't have
people screaming in the hospital.

111
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,239
I'm very sorry about this.

112
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,002
It's all because he's being stupid...

113
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,903
...and saying that he doesn't
want to be examined again.

114
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:47,208
I see. I'm sure he's saying that
because he's scared of the exam.

115
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,817
Honestly! Men are such wimps, but
they like to act tough. They're liars...

116
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,822
They're unkind... They're idiots...

117
00:09:55,227 --> 00:10:00,290
...and most of them have a mommy
complex. I really wonder if there
are any decent men out there?

wailing in a place like this...

Ma'am.

124
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,263
You should fix him now before it's too late...

125
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,040
...because I'm positive he won't
be able to find a wife in the future.

129
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,934
Um... Doctor, what are you looking at?

130
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,373
Aren't you going to check
the area where the pain is?

131
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,967
A check up?

132
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,244
Lately, there've been a lot of people
complaining about sexual harassment...

133
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,746
So I try to stay away from conduct
that might give the wrong impression.

134
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:58,890
Oh...

135
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,416
You want me to check you?

136
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:06,631
Well, I was wondering if I'm going to
be OK with just a visual check up...

137
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,259
You're right. Then...

138
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,705
Let's do an enema.

139
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,468
I knew he was going to say that.

140
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,808
That's what you call sexual harassment!

141
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:26,510
Doctor, I hate to be
rude, but I can't do that.

142
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,214
I'm not the type of person who
can go to the bathroom...

143
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,185
...while someone else is watching.

144
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:37,656
I see. But the pain that's
ailing you right now...

145
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,364
Yes! The pain and suffering...

146
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,797
...like the fires of hell within your
stomach, burning your intestines...

147
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,564
That can only be relieved with an enema!

148
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:52,735
Do you understand?

149
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,036
Yes...

150
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,309
Let's get this...

151
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,348
...started!!

152
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,815
Let's do the special version today.

153
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,079
Now... Don't hold it in, let your suffering go!

154
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,544
I can't hold it anymore!

155
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,915
What an amazing sense of
relief and climactic sensation.

156
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,791
I just went to the bathroom while
someone was watching me...

157
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,325
...but what's this liberation I feel?

158
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,631
Dr. Takebayashi...

159
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,969
What just happened to me?

160
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,900
You have just set foot into
the realm of the unknown...

161
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,408
...and realized its magnificence!

162
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,375
Magnificence of the realm of the unknown?

163
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,648
Doctor, you're the one who taught me that.

164
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:06,944
Yes!

165
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,017
Doctor... You're so dreamy...

166
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,455
Do you want to keep on going?

167
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:16,718
Yes.

168
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:18,591
Then...

169
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,641
It's amazing, Doctor!
Doctor!! I can't anymore!!

170
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,419
I'm going to cum! Doctor, cum with me!!

171
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:18,521
I'm going to cum! Cum! Cum! Cum!

172
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:29,665
Doctor... You're amazing... I love you...

173
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,704
Thank you very much.

174
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,505
There's no need to thank me.
It's my fault for startling you.

175
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,593
Satsuki.

176
00:14:58,998 --> 00:14:59,794
N... Naho?

177
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,530
Satsuki, I'm quitting my job as a nurse.

178
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,463
What? What do you mean?

179
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,198
I'm quitting, because I'm getting married.

180
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:08,939
Married?

181
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,233
You mean, with Dr. Waka?

182
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,808
That's not funny. Why would I marry him?

183
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,014
Then who are you going to marry?

184
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,639
Kenichi.

185
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,939
I want to make your wish come true.

186
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,645
You might think I'm being foolish, but...

187
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,956
Um... I'm sorry about the other day.

188
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,797
I said some stupid things,
without even considering...

189
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,658
...how much anxiety you must
have, waiting for your test results.

190
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,036
It's not like... I'm angry at you, so...

191
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,203
I bet you were pissed about something
that had nothing to do with me.

192
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,513
Well... You're right, but...

193
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,450
Then could you stop glaring
at me with such a scary face?

194
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,513
This is how I always look.
So don't worry about it.

195
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,121
Oh, really?

196
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:40,930
Give it to me.

197
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,869
Thirty-six point five. You're fine.

198
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,297
Nurse.

199
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,705
You know, right?

200
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:51,470
About my illness...

201
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,303
This student needs to be
reexamined immediately.

202
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,048
You're still getting tested, so no...

203
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,318
It's all right. You don't have to hide it.

204
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,289
I'm prepared.

205
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,015
Prepared?

206
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:08,887
Yeah.

207
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,853
But there's one thing I haven't done yet.

208
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,400

213
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,372
Nurse...

214
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,150
Then, that means I'm going to...

215
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,917
I told you, your results aren't in yet.

216
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,685
Don't worry about that now.

217
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,292
Then why?

218
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,169
Yes. That's good. You're doing great.

219
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,503
Stick your finger in...

220
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:58,701
Ok.

221
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,553
Yes. That's great.

222
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,243
It feels really good.

223
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,987
More. Faster. Thrust your finger in and out.

224
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,503
Nurse. I'm going to cum.

225
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,119
I'm really going to cum!

226
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,986
Don't cum yet.

227
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,061
You want to become a man, right?

228
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:51,958
Then...

229
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,225
You have to do it right.

230
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:00,504
Yes, right there. You're
in me. How does it feel?

231
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,703
I can't... I'm going to cum!

232
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,673
Wait! Thrust slowly.

233
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,660
Yes. You're doing well.

234
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,030
Don't be in such a hurry. Take your time.

235
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,367
Shit! I came in you.

236
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,010
That's all right.

237
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:43,813
All right...

238
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,518
What, Naho? Why'd you bring me in here?

239
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,891
This. A patient named Kenichi
Endo asked me to give this to you.

240
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,222
Huh? From that student guy?

241
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,564
Hey, it's open!

242
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,562
Naho, you didn't read it did you?

243
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,673
Excuse me!? It was open already.

244
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,478
But this...

245
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:13,579
He's calling me! I must hurry...
But this...

He's calling me! I must hurry...

What was that? She's acting so creepy.

248
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,251
To Nurse.

249
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,452
Thank you for the other night.

250
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,858
I never would have thought
you'd do that for me.

251
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,628
It made me really happy.

252
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:38,129
I'm not saying I was able to leave
the hospital because of it, but...

253
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,266
I feel like I have a much
more positive outlook on life.

254
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,899
Huh? He's gone?

Satsuki, would you like to
have coffee in my room?

Dr. Midori?

278
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,924
I'm sure a lot has happened...

279
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,591
...but if you want to bitch
and moan, I'm all ears.

280
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,164
I see. So that's what happened...

281
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,100
You seem to be regretting
what you've done, but...

282
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,442
You did it all out of
compassion for the patients.

283
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,417
True, you went a little too far as a nurse...

284
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,954
...but I don't think it's something
to be ashamed of as a person.

285
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,851
Do you really think so?

286
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,921
I wonder what that was earlier?

287
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,330
Dr. Midori is such a nice person.

288
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,998
You should be more proud of yourself.

289
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,859
You've done something good.

290
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,604
What she's saying is weird, but...

291
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,504
Anyway, what's wrong?

292
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,178
Why are you acting so reserved?

293
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,678
There's no need to be nervous.

294
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:10,086
Well, I've never worked
for the maternity ward...

295
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,785
...and I really haven't worked
especially close with you, so...

296
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:21,495
I was kind of wondering why you're
listening to me complain like this...

297
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:27,431
It's because I've fallen in love with you.

298
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,702
I'm in love with you.

299
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,436
I'm sorry!

300
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:07,368
I'm flattered about how you feel
about me, but I'm not a lesbian.

301
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,381
It's fine. That's what they
all say when they leave me.

302
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,919
I'm used to it, so don't let it...

303
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,487
Dr. Midori! Please don't cry.

304
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,253
You're such an amazing
person, you'll find someone.

305
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,453
Stop trying to comfort me!

306
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,332
I don't want your halfhearted sympathy.

307
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,632
That'll make me feel even worse!

308
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,826
You don't even mean it, so stop.

309
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,267
I'm going to do it again...

310
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:40,812
If it's only once...

311
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,983
It's my way of saying thank
you for listening to me.

312
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,575
Just for today, I'll...

313
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,053
Satsuki, are you sure?

314
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,718
I'm sure, Doctor.

315
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,257
This is the type of life
fate has in store for me.

316
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,307
Satsuki, you're gorgeous.

317
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,343
Your body is as beautiful as I imagined it.

318
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,418
And you're so wet down here.

319
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:38,066
Satsuki, do the same to me.

320
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,977
Yes... suck my pussy more... lick me.

321
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,774
I want to you to feel more pleasure...

322
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,987
What do you think? It's cold and slippery.

323
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,154
Doesn't it feel good?

324
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:13,166
It feels so strange...

325
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,165
We're just getting started.

326
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:37,123
Doctor. I feel like my body's going to melt.

327
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,729
Yes. Our bodies are melting into each other.

328
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,814
I knew this is what you
liked best. Be honest!

329
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,778
It feels good. Really
good... I can't anymore!

330
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,011
I'm not going to let you cum.

331
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,051
If you're satisfied with this,
you need to be punished!

332
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,226
More! More!!

333
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,633
Doctor... Doctor...

334
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:33,708
Doctor.

335
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:34,880
Huh?

336
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,718
Is it true that you're getting
married to Dr. Waka?

337
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:40,285
With Hideyuki?

338
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,461
Hideyuki and I have been
friends since college.

339
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,421
That's it.

340
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,293
Really...

341
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,903
He's in love with you. I know it.

342
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,075
He's a very good person.

343
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,674
He's very considerate and sweet.

344
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:07,709
He's great, but Hideyuki
has one terrible flaw.

345
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:09,051
A flaw?

346
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:14,914
His personality completely changes
when he drinks and sleeps with anyone.

347
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,352
On top of that, when he wakes
up, he doesn't remember a thing.

348
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,895
To tell you the truth, he raped
me one time when he was drunk.

349
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,298
He felt so terrible that he
asked me to marry him.

350
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,336
But I can't marry him.

351
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:37,308
And about yesterday, I want
you to stop asklng me out.

352
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,148
To be blunt, I'm not Interested.

353
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,516
I'm up for Sunday's plan...

354
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,654
...because I'm not a cold guy
Ilke your frlend tells me I am.

355
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,327
He only said that to get back at you.

356
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,189
He said it only out of desperation.

357
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,927
It's just proof of how much
he's in love with you.

358
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,160
Doctor, I...

359
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,627
It's all right. Don't say anything.

360
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:04,340
Go to Hideyuki. Now it's your
turn to fulfill your fantasy.

361
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:05,432
Yes.

362
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,845
He's not here. I wonder if he's at the lab.

363
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,548
Satsuki, do you need to see
Dr. Waka about something?

364
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,553
Yes, I do...

365
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,914
Dr. Waka is at Dr. Takebayashi's place.

366
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,393
Really?

367
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:23,683
Dr. Takebayashi?

368
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,830
Oh, and Naho Ota was with them too.

369
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:31,893
I wonder what she's thinking,
getting married to Dr. Enema...

370
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,134
Naho? Dr. Enema? Dr. Waka?

371
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:38,834
They can't be!?
