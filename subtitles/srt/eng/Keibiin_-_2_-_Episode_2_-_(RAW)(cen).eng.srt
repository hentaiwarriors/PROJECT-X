00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,180
Amasato-kun.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,810
Doctor.

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,440
Your body is always so sexy.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,320
Doctor!

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,580
It feels wonderful.

7
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,910
Good girl.

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,850
You're already wet? You're really sensitive.

9
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,060
You taught me everything.

10
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,860
Everything...

11
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,980
Doctor...

12
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,780
No!

13
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,570
No.

14
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,410
I'm embarrassed. Don't look at me, Doctor.

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,660
No!

16
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,340
Doctor...

17
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,670
Oh, please...

18
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,890
Doctor!

19
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,920
Doctor...

20
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm cumming. Something's coming...

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,930
Doctor! Doctor!

22
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,770
What do you mean?

23
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,770
I wanted to tell you earlier,

24
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,940
but I had a hard time bringing it up.

25
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,190
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,160
I'm engaged. I can't get out of it.

27
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,120
Is that... what this is about?

28
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,130
Welcome back, Onee-chan.

29
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,430
Tsukiko, what's wrong?

30
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,010
Youre late,

31
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,970
so I was worried.

32
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,230
How's Kenta?

33
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,980
He's trying his best to stay awake,

34
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,020
because I told him you were
gonna buy him a video game.

35
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,400
Oh. I must apologize to Kenta, too.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,660
I...

37
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,740
just quit the hospital.

38
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:42,880

Episode 2: The Indecent Security Monitor

39
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,820
<i>Still far away...</i>

40
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,910
Um, I'm sorry!

41
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,540
No, it was my fault.

42
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,790
<i>Shit.</i>

43
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,670
<i>There she is!</i>

44
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,130
I'm sorry,

45
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,260
but can you come with me for a minute?

46
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,060
Manager.

47
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,770
Ah, Minomiya-kun.

48
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,770
Is something the matter?

49
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,360
Good timing.

50
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,110
<i>At a closer glance, she's a prize!</i>

51
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,360
<i>Shit, if only the witch weren't here, I could get her.</i>

52
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,370
Security Room

53
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,450
I-I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

54
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,500
Well, since it's your first offense,

55
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,090
I'll let you off with a warning today.

56
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,710
<i>The start of the hunt is the most crucial.</i>

57
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,130
<i>I must mark my prey myself.</i>

58
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,180
<i>Too bad, but I guess I have to give up on this one.</i>

59
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,480
<i>She has a big sister, too?</i>

60
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,150
<i>This might come in handy.</i>

61
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,520
Oh, no!

62
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,770
<i>Stupid woman.</i>

63
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,570
My, my, I guess I can't let this one slide.

64
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,950
May I help you?

65
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,370
Th-Thanks!

66
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,170
That shocked me.

67
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,290
But, oh well, I guess it wasn't that
big of a deal once I did it.

68
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,770
<i>Jeez. Why am I so bad at balancing my budget?</i>

69
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,440
<i>There are so many days left until payday.</i>

70
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,610
<i>I guess... just for this month...</i>

71
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,980
<i>I'd better do something.</i>

72
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,780
No way.

73
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,870
Wh-Why did she do it?

74
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,790
This is the item she stole.

75
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,830
But that's...

76
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,090
You're currently unemployed, right?

77
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,720
Your sister told me everything.

78
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,720
What a heartbreaking story.

79
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,560
She wanted to help buy her little brother
a game without bothering her big sister.

80
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,470
But you see...

81
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,940
I'll pay for the game! Just don't tell anyone.

82
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,440
One million yen to keep me quiet.

83
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,530
But I don't have that kind of money... not on me.

84
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,410
That's what l'd like to say,

85
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,410
but you're the head of your household.

86
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,410
And you're unemployed.

87
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,580
So you see...

88
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,630
This isn't a joke! How dare you!

89
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,090
I'll turn you over to the authorities!

90
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,010
Go ahead. Be my guest

91
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,590
But if you do,

92
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,340
then I'll tell the police about your sister.

93
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,680
If you care about your sisters future,

94
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,940
isn't giving yourself to me just once a fair trade?

95
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,400
You're worth about a million yen.

96
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,570
I guarantee it.

97
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,820
Don't bother. I'll undress myself.

98
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,950
Not so fast.

99
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,250
If you want to take off your clothes,
there's a proper place for doing it.

100
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,290
This is a department store, after all.

101
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,380
<i>This is such a big store.</i>

102
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,380
<i>So what if I steal something little?</i>

103
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,140
<i>It won't hurt them a bit.</i>

104
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,310
<i>Yes, that's true.</i>

105
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,070
What's going on?

106
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,860
What am I supposed to do here?

107
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,410
Like I said, undress. Right here.

108
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,410
You can't be serious!

109
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,290
Oops. I wouldn't yell if I were you.

110
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,500
Business may be slow on a weekday afternoon,

111
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,250
but it's not like there's no one here.

112
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,880
You are insane.

113
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,140
So you finally get it?

114
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,270
That's a good idea. Something for summer, too.

115
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,780
Just make it quick.

116
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,160
Enjoy your pride while you can.

117
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,120
<i>It's too late anyway.</i>

118
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,080
<i>I've already lost everything.</i>

119
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,880
You're pretty small.

120
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,430
H-Hurry.

121
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,930
If you wanna do it, just do it.

122
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,560
Spread your legs.

123
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,050
I'm hard, see?

124
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,130
And you're all wet.

125
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,800
You're enjoying it, aren't you?

126
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,600
N-No, I'm not.

127
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,450
<i>What was that?</i>

128
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,410
<i>Just now... I heard a strange voice.</i>

129
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,460
Turn around and show me your butt.

130
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,220
What a great angle.

131
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,680
Take a look at yourself.

132
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,310
Don't you like it?

133
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,200
You're too loud.

134
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,280
Or do you want to be caught?

135
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,870
No.

136
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,650
Oh, no, my voice...

137
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,200
If you wanna scream, then scream.

138
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,030
No.

139
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,890
No ones here.

140
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,600
I guess that should do it. Time to go home.

141
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,320
No...

142
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,150
Excuse me!

143
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,740
Shit.

144
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,120
Oh, no.

145
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,890
Now for the other problem!

146
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,410
That was really scary.

147
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,530
I should go home now.

148
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,920
Miss, may I talk to you?

149
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,090
But I didn't really...

150
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,250
I didn't.

151
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,430
That didn't pass through the register, did it?

152
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,070
I've been waiting for you, Miss.

153
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,750
A nice view, isn't it? Quite stunning.

154
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,340
A great view even for a security guard.

155
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,380
Why did you bring me here?

156
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,890
Well, I wonder.

157
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,770
Will you really keep quiet for me?

158
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,480
Yeah.

159
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,060
I'll stay quiet about your shoplifting.

160
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,570
Um...

161
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,780
but why did I see you in the dressing room?

162
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,030
Well.

163
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,200
She was the same as you.

164
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,080
So you see...

165
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,700
You're not a little girl.

166
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,580
I'm sure you knew all along why I called you here.

167
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,880
Stop It!

168
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,750
Please stop it!

169
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,130
I'll take off my own clothes.

170
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,550
That's a good idea.

171
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,560
You wouldn't want your clothes torn.

172
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,140
Your husband would find out.

173
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,480
Um...

174
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,020
All of it?

175
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,440
Of course all of it.

176
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,580
In this kind of place?

177
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,880
The lights are off. No one will see you.

178
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,220
We don't need to hold back.

179
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,640
Hold back?

180
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,020
What are you...

181
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,810
Oh, no!

182
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,980
No!

183
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,030
Someone, help me!

184
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,370
Miss, you're too stubborn.

185
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,760
Ow! Not so suddenly!

186
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
I don't like it!

187
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,930
Ow!

188
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,690
Oh, no!

189
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,410
I'm sorry. Please forgive me!

190
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,500
No!

191
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,330
No... No!

192
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,110
Answer it.

193
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,570
Hello?

194
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,700
Darling!

195
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,700
What's wrong? Where are you?

196
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,620
You can't sleep?

197
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,540
In that case...

198
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,390
No. It's nothing.

199
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,810
There's brandy.

200
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,810
On the top shelf.

201
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,650
Don't worry. I have plenty of alcohol...

202
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,400
tucked away.

203
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,280
Yes.

204
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,700
I will.

205
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,200
I'll come home as soon as I can.

206
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,420
I'll be careful.

207
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,630
Yes.

208
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,840
Go to bed without me.

209
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,720
Good night.

210
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,090
Was that your husband?

211
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,470
That's a fine expression.

212
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,530
That's a married woman for you.

213
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,450
Great at moving her hips.

214
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,040
Makes me jealous of your husband.

215
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,920
<i>Yes. I love that face.</i>

216
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,010
No!

217
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,930
Please.

218
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,230
No!

219
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,450
Please let me go.

220
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,240
Let me go!

221
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,290
I'll cum very soon.

222
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,670
Inside? No!

223
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,920
Be nice, wifey. I'll shoot plenty of stuff into you.

224
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,140
No! I don't want to!

225
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,350
Please! Anything but that!

226
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,680
Please. Cum outside.

227
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,020
No! No!

228
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm cumming, wifey.

229
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,750
No!

230
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,320
<i>It 's all my fault</i>

231
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,280
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

232
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,250
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

233
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,000
<i>darling!</i>

234
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
To Be Continued...
