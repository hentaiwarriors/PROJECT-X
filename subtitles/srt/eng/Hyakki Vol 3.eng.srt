1
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:55,619
You are so stubborn...

2
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:58,316
You still don't want
to listen to me, huh?

3
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:08,763
I'll never listen to you...

4
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:11,598
I guess you need more punishment...

5
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:15,810
I'll punish you as much
as you want, with this.

6
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:23,542
Put it in your mouth.

7
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:25,984
Now please me.

8
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,857
I'd never put that
filthy thing in my mouth!

9
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,186
I told you to put it in your mouth!

10
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:36,056
Listen to what I say! Do
everything I tell you to do!

11
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:39,959
If you disobey me, I'll
just force you to obey me.

12
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,041
That's good...

13
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:48,810
Suck it harder.

14
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,669
I feel good!

15
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,850
I'm coming!

16
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,648
Swallow all my come.

17
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:07,488
How dare you bite me?

18
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,327
What's that look?

19
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:16,762
Akari, you are my sex slave!

20
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:18,998
You can't run away from me anymore!

21
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:22,667
Be loyal to me! Be a loyal sex slave!

22
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,011
No!

23
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:27,116
I would rather die
than become your slave!

24
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:32,211
Okay then, I'll display
you like a doll...

25
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:35,255
...like a cold, dead doll!

26
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,497
Now you're mine.

27
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:48,862
You'll be by my side forever.

28
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,170
Please, someone help me.

29
01:01:55,511 --> 01:02:00,244
Release me from this man...

30
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:01,542
Someone...

31
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:07,388
Chapter Three: Wakaba

32
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:33,714
Who would do such a horrible thing?

33
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:37,949
Ryuichi!

34
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:52,728
Shinohara had the same
burn on his skin...

35
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,603
What's wrong, Ryuichi?

36
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:08,508
Emi, you must be the
one who killed them...

37
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,746
What are you talking about, Ryuichi?

38
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:17,258
You have a bandage covering a
burn on your hand, don't you?

39
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:24,832
Tomoko, Oishi, and Shinohara,
they all had burns on their bodies.

40
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:27,995
It looks like the burns
are from a stun gun...

41
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:31,733
And the burn on your hand is also...

42
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:32,897
Yes, that's true...

43
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,168
I'm impressed, Ryuichi...

44
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:38,837
Emi, why did you do it?

45
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:45,017
All I did was eliminate the people
who got in the way of my master.

46
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:47,622
You bitch! You killed Tomoko!

47
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:00,660
Master Yoshimasa...

48
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:01,737
Yoshimasa?

49
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,433
He is my master, Yoshimasa Okouchi...

50
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:10,874
Okouchi? You mean the
owner of this island?

51
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:15,182
The nuisance must go.

52
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:17,452
Ryuichi!

53
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:18,383
Ryuichi!

54
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:18,976
Ryuichi!

55
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,144
Go now!

56
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,118
B-But...

57
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:22,322
Just go!

58
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,187
Okay!

59
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:24,756
Let's go!

60
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,620
Ryuichi!

61
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:30,594
Takashi!

62
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,258
Don't worry about us, just go!

63
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,002
Ryuichi!

64
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,127
Wakaba, we gotta go!

65
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:39,964
Shoko!

66
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,075
You'd better stop resisting.

67
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:45,246
Wakaba! Run!

68
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:48,014
Hurry! Please Wakaba...

69
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:49,141
You...

70
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:46,438
Since we did get new
slaves as planned...

71
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:50,509
...I'll forgive you for letting
them find this place, Emi.

72
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:53,077
Thank you, Master Yoshimasa...

73
01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:59,185
No!

74
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:05,783
Shoko, please don't move around so
much.

75
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,764
I'm sorry Hiromi, but I can't help it...

76
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:33,414
Shoko...

77
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:36,116
Hiromi! Hiromi!

78
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:46,826
Who told you that you could come?

79
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:54,073
You must follow Mr. Yoshimasa's order.

80
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,809
Now, who's going to make this happy?

81
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:57,704
No!

82
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,110
We'd never do that!

83
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,850
You must not disobey Master
Yoshimasa!

84
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,746
Do you want more punishment?

85
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:12,490
You finally realized your position.

86
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:14,891
Here's a reward.

87
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,663
Who told you to stop?

88
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:27,465
The reason I planned this mystery
tour was to find new slaves.

89
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:31,706
And you two were chosen.
You should be happy.

90
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:37,048
The one who ran away will
have to join you later.

91
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:48,526
Lick up Master's come.

92
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,050
Don't come, Wakaba!

93
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:10,152
Run away!

94
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,286
Wakaba! Run!

95
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:25,859
Emi, what are you doing?

96
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:27,196
Come help me.

97
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:29,395
Yes, Master Yoshimasa...

98
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,487
Shoko!

99
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:55,486
I don't think you have time to
worry about your friend now...

100
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:08,674
You will be next, so just wait there.

101
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:17,047
You have what it takes to be my slave...

102
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:21,549
I'll take good care of
you if you obey me...

103
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:24,989
You must be jealous, Akari.

104
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:29,260
You could've been the one to serve me!

105
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:30,925
Enough!

106
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:35,904
Master Yoshimasa!

107
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,870
Wakaba! Takashi! Let's go!

108
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:43,274
Yes!

109
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:46,811
Master Yoshimasa! Are you all right?

110
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:49,076
You useless piece of...

111
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:50,678
Master Yoshimasa!

112
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:55,185
Screw it.

113
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,952
I'll kill them all!

114
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,127
Master Yoshimasa? Are you all right?

115
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,097
Master Yoshimasa! Why?

116
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:19,572
I'll kill anyone who is useless.
I'll kill anyone who disobeys me!

117
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,525
What should we do next, Ryuichi?

118
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:32,954
Let's get off this island
as soon as possible!

119
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:39,229
But Ryuichi, we can't even call
for help. What are we going to do?

120
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,996
There must be a way. Just think...

121
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:43,931
What's wrong, Wakaba?

122
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:46,403
I have to take Ron with me!

123
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:49,077
Forget about that aloe for now!

124
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:51,141
I won't go without Ron!

125
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,612
Wakaba! Stop being selfish!

126
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:55,580
I'm going to get really mad!

127
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:57,675
No! Ron has to go with me!

128
01:10:58,687 --> 01:10:59,847
Wakaba!

129
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:06,553
Takashi, please take
care of Hiromi and Shoko!

130
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:07,594
Of course!

131
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:25,543
I'm sorry Ron, this is the
only piece I can take with me...

132
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:29,147
Let's go Wakaba...

133
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,487
The island that doesn't have trees...

134
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:40,390
Wakaba?

135
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:45,661
I wish I could see this
island filled with trees!

136
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:48,596
This island filled with trees...

137
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:57,702
Where are Takashi and the others?

138
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,973
We should have
picked a place to meet up...

139
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:06,616
We couldn't find the last chapter
to make our wish come true...

140
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:08,656
It's not the time to talk about it!

141
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:16,892
I finally found you...

142
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:20,765
You will pay for disobeying
me with your lives.

143
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,470
Brother...

144
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:25,768
Wait, please let Wakaba go!

145
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,272
Shut up! It's a waste
to beg for your life!

146
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:29,674
I'll kill you all!

147
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,187
Ryuichi!

148
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:41,987
Wakaba!

149
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:50,428
Wakaba!

150
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,029
Ryuichi, are you alright?

151
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:55,500
You're crazy. Why you did that?

152
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:58,469
I'm okay if you are safe...

153
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,470
Don't speak now, Wakaba!

154
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:07,411
I remember you held me in
your arms like this before...

155
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:11,643
That's right.

156
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:17,517
I held Wakaba in my arms
like this a long time ago...

157
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,855
I'll protect you...

158
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:21,691
Don't speak!

159
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:26,426
I'll protect you.

160
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:32,264
Wakaba!

161
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:36,076
Wake up! Wakaba!

162
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:39,838
I'll send both of you to Heaven!

163
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,108
What?

164
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:53,424
You must be the one from 8 years ago...

165
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:01,667
I killed you back then.

166
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,395
Why are you here now?

167
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:11,512
Master Yoshimasa, I swear that
I'll be loyal to you all my life...

168
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:16,509
So please come with me...

169
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:21,147
Master Yoshimasa...

170
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:32,897
8 years ago

171
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:50,848
It's been a while since I
visited this island, Yutaka.

172
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,645
Oh yeah...

173
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:04,023
The view from here hasn't changed...

174
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,133
True...

175
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,168
Do you remember, Ron?

176
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:10,300
Two years have passed since
people left this island...

177
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:13,806
Although the weeds should
have covered this island...

178
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:18,937
...the plants couldn't grow
here because of the sea water.

179
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:30,515
Let's go to the Kotodama shrine
and offer these 1 5 chapters...

180
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:31,456
Yes!

181
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:35,322
So, what did you wish for?

182
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:36,431
It's a secret!

183
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,467
But you'll be surprised...

184
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:41,602
Well, Ron is a hint!

185
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,331
Finally, Yutaka.

186
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:47,372
Yes.

187
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:50,805
Who is it?

188
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,847
Help me, Yutaka!

189
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,277
Akari? Why are you here?

190
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:02,823
Is that your friend, Akari Mitsuhashi?

191
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:03,754
Yeah...

192
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:07,485
Akari! Are you all right?

193
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:10,925
She is my slave.

194
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:13,131
Don't bother me...

195
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:14,200
Who are you?

196
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:18,161
I'm afraid that I have to kill
both of you since you saw my secret.

197
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:39,152
Wakaba, are you all
right? Hang in there.

198
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:44,363
I don't think I can make it...

199
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:52,433
Thank you for taking care
of me like a real sister...

200
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:56,702
What are you talking about? I
won't let you go. So stay with me!

201
01:16:57,012 --> 01:17:03,144
I've wanted to tell you
something for a long time...

202
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:07,081
What is it?

203
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:11,349
I love you. I've loved
you for a long time...

204
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:17,899
I love you as a woman...

205
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:18,624
Wakaba...

206
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:25,573
If you see me as a woman, kiss me...

207
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:26,966
Wakaba...

208
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,134
This is my last favor...

209
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:35,083
Die!

210
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:40,086
All must die if they know my secret!

211
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:52,961
Run...

212
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,893
Please run, Yutaka...

213
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,435
Yes! I recall everything now!

214
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:09,210
I'm a reincarnation of Yutaka...

215
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,251
Those memories, dreams...

216
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:16,146
That's why I'm familiar with
everything about Oka Island.

217
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,286
Ryuichi...

218
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,192
Ryuichi, I wanted to see you..

219
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,426
I've been waiting for you...

220
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:31,338
I've wanted to see you again.

221
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:32,495
Wakaba...

222
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:34,271
Ryuichi!

223
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:40,509
Ryuichi...

224
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:41,976
Wakaba...

225
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:08,341
Ryuichi, that's my...

226
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,909
Ryuichi! Ryuichi!

227
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:30,727
Wakaba, let's become one.

228
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:32,798
Yes, Ryuichi.

229
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:36,904
Wakaba...

230
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:40,532
This is how Ryuichi feels...

231
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:41,835
I'm so happy...

232
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,570
I'm happy too, Wakaba...

233
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,517
Ryuichi!

234
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,730
Ryuichi! Ryuichi!

235
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:16,238
I'm coming!

236
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:19,208
Wakaba!

237
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:38,588
Thank you, Ryuichi...

238
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:42,961
I have nothing to regret now...

239
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:49,639
Ryuichi, I love you...

240
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:03,224
We were finally reunited...

241
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:07,952
...but I couldn't save her life again.

242
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:14,735
The last chapter...

243
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:17,268
What is the meaning of this now?

244
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,468
Kotodama shrine...

245
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:29,415
If my wish could really come true...

246
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:32,177
My wish would be...

247
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:33,951
My wish would be...

248
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:32,025
One month later...

249
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:12,134
I can't believe this is Oka Island...

250
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:14,673
I guess Wakaba's wish came true...

251
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:15,707
Yeah...

252
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:39,466
Ryuichi...

253
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:42,836
I wanted to see you!

254
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:45,564
Wakaba? How?

255
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:47,497
Could it be...

256
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:57,114
Kotodama shrine made your wish
come true, too. Thank you, Ryuichi.

257
01:25:57,418 --> 01:25:58,282
Wakaba...

258
01:25:58,386 --> 01:25:59,717
Ryuichi...
