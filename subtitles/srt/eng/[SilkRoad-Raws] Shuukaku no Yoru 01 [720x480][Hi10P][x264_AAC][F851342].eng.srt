1
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:28,774
No, please don't.

2
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:38,116
No, it hurts!

3
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:48,816
Once you cross the bridge,
you'll find yourself in a town...

4
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:50,650
forgotten by society.

5
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:55,356
In the rotten rain, cheetahs are fighting
for their territory...

6
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:58,430
hunting to satisfy their lust.

7
00:01:58,598 --> 00:02:02,500
Surrounded by the river,
spilling with the virgin blood...

8
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:08,700
the town exists in a dream state
somewhere between day and night.

9
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,801
The Harvest Night

10
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:14,403
Episode 1: Rose and Poppy

11
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:28,219
It's a good place.

12
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,173
Please don't. What if someone sees us?

13
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:57,081
No one cares about the others.

14
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:15,438
Who are you guys?

15
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:18,973
No.

16
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:22,310
I told him I didn't want to,
but he forced me to come here.

17
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:29,253
What are you saying?
It was you who brought me here.

18
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:38,561
After messing with our sister,
what nerve you've got to talk like that...

19
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,029
old geezer!

20
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:45,326
Stop it!

21
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:29,738
That old man, he won't be able
to go home now.

22
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:33,449
He didn't have any money on him,
but with those credit cards...

23
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,182
we've got enough to last us for a while.

24
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:40,815
He won't report this to the police
after being caught with his pants down.

25
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,292
Hey, Masato...

26
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:49,795
I've heard Shinji's been stealing
some of our takings.

27
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,706
Where's Honoka?

28
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,172
Your sis?

29
00:04:57,544 --> 00:05:00,604
- She's probably at her regular hangout.
- Is she?

30
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:04,147
I'm really bored.

31
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,086
Hey, Masato!

32
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:13,182
I hear you've been making
a lot of money recently.

33
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,797
Why don't you share some with us?

34
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:20,593
We've got no obligations to you.

35
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:23,860
Who taught you to talk like that, Emi?

36
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:26,303
You have no idea, have you?

37
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:28,938
Shut up, Wakaba!

38
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:33,844
You don't mean to resort
to brute force, do you?

39
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:45,622
Shut up!

40
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,522
Can't you give me a better price?

41
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:52,655
It wasn't easy to get them, you know.

42
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,495
Shinji, I can't change the going rate.

43
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:58,229
If you don't like what I offer,
go somewhere else.

44
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:02,174
Shinji. Hurry up, otherwise...

45
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:03,707
Masato will get mad.

46
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:07,010
Cut it out, Lisa.

47
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:09,975
All right, how about this. Look.

48
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:14,117
You were hiding that?

49
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,311
If Masato finds out, dude.

50
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:19,882
What about Masato?
Don't be such a scaredy cat.

51
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:23,952
If you're including that watch,
what about this?

52
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:27,693
That's not enough.

53
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:32,397
If you're scared of Masato,
I've got something you might like.

54
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:37,606
You know what? I don't want it.

55
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:40,769
Never lost a street fight, anyway.

56
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:46,881
It's not like I'm sad.

57
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:49,912
It's not like I want to cry.

58
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,582
It's just that I don't want to be
reminded of that time.

59
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:59,387
I just want to fall asleep quietly.

60
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:11,476
At that time all around here,
there were loads of dandelions.

61
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:13,709
When there was a breeze...

62
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,908
silvery cotton balls danced
across the sky.

63
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:20,576
In the middle of them stood that girl.

64
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,011
It was all a dream.

65
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,552
Just a dream.

66
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:32,097
That girl died at that point in time.

67
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:37,165
Now, everything. I loathe everything.

68
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:40,069
It's not like I'm sad.

69
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:42,967
It's not like I want to cry.

70
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,181
That shopkeeper's
taking advantage of me.

71
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:55,215
It's your fault, Shinji.

72
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:58,447
Stealing from Masato.
Your ass is so grass.

73
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,327
What's that girl doing here?

74
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,332
What are you looking for?

75
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:20,007
We'll be happy to help you out.

76
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:23,011
No, thanks. It's quite all right.

77
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:26,985
What are you doing?

78
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:30,313
You should accept kindness from strangers.

79
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,982
Shinji. Will you stop beating
about the bush?

80
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:36,625
Hurry up and just take her.

81
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:39,155
That's right.

82
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,627
We're all going to rape you.

83
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:43,464
Please don't.

84
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,605
We've found a nice gift
to bring back to Masato.

85
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:47,831
What? Masato?

86
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:50,066
Did you say Masato just now?

87
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,470
That's right.

88
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:56,282
Hey you, don't say
our leader's name so carelessly.

89
00:08:58,685 --> 00:08:59,913
Honoka.

90
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:01,342
Honoka?

91
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,650
Is that you, Honoka?

92
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,653
What're you doing here, Ryoko?

93
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:11,428
It can't be.

94
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:14,366
What's the matter? Wakaba?

95
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:17,499
Look at this.
All of them are beaten up.

96
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:20,630
What a big mess!

97
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,699
Masato.

98
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,309
Is that you?
Why did you come here?

99
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:28,241
Shinji! You're late!

100
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:32,750
- I'm back with some good stuff.
- Can't believe it!

101
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:35,855
You're always away at a critical time.
You octopus!

102
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,286
Sorry about that, Emi.

103
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:52,330
Honoka! You okay?

104
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:55,568
Yeah. Ryoko, I'm glad you're okay.

105
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:05,081
What about that woman?

106
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:06,717
What's she going to do?

107
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:22,724
She's not going to stay with us...

108
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:24,292
is she?

109
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:33,970
It's good.

110
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:35,808
Hey, Masato.

111
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:41,919
Masato, let's go home with Honoka.

112
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:47,021
Wait! What are you?

113
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:48,752
No, don't!

114
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:52,320
Until they both agree to return,
I'm staying here.

115
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,561
Do as you please. Let's go, Emi.

116
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:04,607
So, what's that woman...

117
00:11:04,877 --> 00:11:05,741
to you?

118
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:07,937
A childhood friend.

119
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:13,680
If that's all, that's fine.

120
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:23,390
Masato, I can't anymore, no...

121
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:24,822
I'm coming!

122
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:39,601
Honoka, will you please try
and persuade him?

123
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:44,172
I think he'd listen to you,
coming from his own sister.

124
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:49,552
Ryokyo, why don't you go back without us.

125
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:52,289
Why are you always so mean?

126
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:59,097
It's because of what you did.

127
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:00,521
No.

128
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:03,668
It's not true.

129
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:06,827
No.

130
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:15,573
Sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.

131
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,214
Honoka, you okay?

132
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:29,288
Honoka? No!

133
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:44,440
Dear, what's wrong, Wakaba?

134
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,878
Why are your tits so hard and excited?

135
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:00,990
Why is it so wet down here?

136
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:05,127
What a slut you are,
shaking your butt like that.

137
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:07,698
Looks like you want it really bad.

138
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:13,331
See?

139
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:16,738
Now you understand what happens
to those who're against us.

140
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:18,604
Do you see what I mean?

141
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,413
It's too late.

142
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:28,680
Does it hurt that much?

143
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,018
Sorry about that, Wakaba.

144
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,015
Poor girl.

145
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:37,857
Lisa always likes to go all the way.

146
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,839
Why are you so embarrassed, Lisa?

147
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,071
Damn it! What was that?

148
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:01,753
Hey, don't break her before we do.

149
00:14:02,555 --> 00:14:05,786
I'm bored. Do whatever
you want with her. Who cares.

150
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:13,156
It must've been painful.

151
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:16,392
Rest assured, I'm the gentle one.

152
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,179
With your stomach full,
it's quite tight in there.

153
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:35,083
You can't really enjoy it like that
let me help you relax.

154
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,690
Yeah! It's getting tighter even.

155
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,734
Now, you can have fun.

156
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:52,702
Wakaba, why don't you let it all out.

157
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:02,541
Hey, don't be so reserved.

158
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:14,123
Don't worry, Honoka.
Everything will be just fine.

159
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:18,095
If you leave this untreated,
your life is at risk.

160
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:22,800
If you want to get cured,
you'd better leave town right away.

161
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:26,732
I'll take you to the doctor, right now.
You'll be fine.

162
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:46,654
Please forgive me, now!

163
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,121
Had enough!

164
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:00,831
I'm coming!

165
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:06,138
I'm coming!

166
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:22,651
So, how was it, Wakaba?

167
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:30,324
You said, you wanted to go back
to the other side of the bridge.

168
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:39,044
Why don't I let you?

169
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,284
It's not like I'm sad.

170
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,624
It's not like I want to cry.

171
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,024
It's just that I don't want to be
reminded of that time.

172
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:03,168
I just want to fall asleep quietly.

173
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:09,600
At that time, all around here,
there were loads of dandelions.

174
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:11,675
When there was a breeze...

175
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:15,503
silvery cotton balls
danced across the sky.

176
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:19,015
In the middle of them stood that girl.

177
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:21,481
It was all a dream.

178
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:23,120
Just a dream.

179
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:27,324
That girl died at that point in time.

180
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:36,957
No.

181
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,126
It's that girl.

182
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,284
That girl, she's just like me.

183
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:08,364
What's wrong?

184
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,560
Do you want to leave town already?

185
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:14,467
Ryoko's well brought up.

186
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:17,007
We can get a good price for her.

187
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:23,873
Izumi, your boobs are so soft.

188
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:25,038
No, I'm not.

189
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:28,279
Why don't you join us?

190
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:31,720
The more variations we've got,
the more customers we'll have.

191
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:41,524
Hello? I got it. I understand.

192
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:44,567
I'll send her right away. Shima!
You're wanted!

193
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:49,370
All right!
So, Ryoko, think about it, okay?

194
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:55,008
Wouldn't that be good?

195
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,839
I bet we'll get along just fine.

196
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:00,247
Honoka! Where's Honoka?

197
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:04,051
Honoka. I saw her leaving with Shinji.

198
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:05,655
They've gone somewhere.

199
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:07,359
How come?

200
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,425
Isn't Shinji your boyfriend?

201
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:15,757
So, Honoka.
Wouldn't that be good?

202
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:18,468
Stop teasing and be my girl.

203
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:21,434
Bro Masato...

204
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:23,639
won't be quiet.

205
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:24,839
So what?

206
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,775
I'm not scared of Masato!

207
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:29,847
I get what I want, no matter what.

208
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:34,518
So, what?

209
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:37,285
Masato.

210
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:40,051
Wanted to talk about the job.

211
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:44,658
Shinji! I told you not to
mess with Honoka.

212
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:45,953
Okay?

213
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,235
Beaten up quite a bit?

214
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:53,629
That Masato.

215
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:55,797
I'll beat him up someday.

216
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,938
You know, Shinji.

217
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:02,207
It seems like Masato cares about...

218
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:04,111
Ryoko after all.

219
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:07,808
Emi doesn't say much
about anything.

220
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:10,287
I bet she doesn't like it.

221
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,154
You know, about the two of them.

222
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:26,102
See you again, mister.

223
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:29,065
What's up, Ryoko?
Have you found Honoka?

224
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,803
What's the matter,
cat got your tongue?

225
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:33,875
Emi! Hey!

226
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,349
How do I look?

227
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:40,480
Emi.

228
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:44,678
That man, just now.
What about Masato?

229
00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:47,587
I love him. What about it?

230
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:50,327
Anyway, did you think about
what we talked about?

231
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,132
You can get six grand
for five photos.

232
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,361
Good old scanty for 15 grand.

233
00:20:57,503 --> 00:21:00,063
Pissing for about 20 grand, I say.

234
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:06,977
Stop it!

235
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:14,142
Ryoko, you shouldn't do that sort of thing!

236
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:17,283
Ryoko, I want you to come with me.

237
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:24,021
What's happening?

238
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:28,366
You're so sweaty.

239
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:37,308
How's it here?

240
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:38,773
You're so excitable.

241
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:50,013
Ryoko, you're so cute.

242
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:54,548
Don't. Honoka, she's watching.

243
00:21:57,896 --> 00:22:01,388
Not yet. I'll make you feel even better.

244
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:02,798
Stop!

245
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:05,503
Don't, not there!

246
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:15,070
You're so wet.

247
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:18,778
Ryoko, even though you don't
look like it, you're really a slut.

248
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,179
Don't say that.

249
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:23,651
Masato.

250
00:22:28,494 --> 00:22:30,553
It's not fair.

251
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:46,706
Masato, please give me...

252
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:52,951
I'm happy for you, Ryoko,
that your wish has come true.

253
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:04,326
It hurts!

254
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:05,921
It hurts!

255
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:08,831
How daring are you
to work without permission?

256
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,424
You've got some nerve.

257
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:14,699
No! That's not it! We're...

258
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:16,800
Stop lying!

259
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:20,239
Lovers don't wander around this area.

260
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:23,113
It's true!
Please, believe me!

261
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:24,239
No!

262
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:31,820
Shinji...

263
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:36,924
a dirty girl like her, hurry up.

264
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,826
Just rape her already.

265
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:43,301
Is that going to be okay?
Without asking Masato?

266
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:48,998
Why do we have to get permission
from him for a thing like this?

267
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:52,266
So long as we clean up
after ourselves...

268
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:53,435
no one will know about it.

269
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,883
That's true.

270
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:02,552
It's their fault after all,
doing it here without permission.

271
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,120
Let's rape her, then.

272
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:07,285
No, stop!

273
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:09,360
No, please, stop it!

274
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:11,362
No! Don't!

275
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,293
No, please!

276
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:20,333
Now, Masato.

277
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,971
I'm embarrassed.

278
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:26,501
It's too late now. Look.

279
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,440
It's a gift from me to you.

280
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:33,273
No.

281
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:35,618
No don't look, Masato.

282
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:46,330
Masato, you're coming!

283
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:50,957
Really?

284
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:55,767
Masato!

285
00:24:58,577 --> 00:25:00,044
I'm happy for you.

286
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:04,714
It's not your first time, then.

287
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:07,841
Don't!

288
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:23,029
Despite your innocent look,
you're pretty experienced.

289
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:24,391
So cute.

290
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:46,622
Don't!

291
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:58,734
You like it, don't you, Ryoko?

292
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:13,149
It's good.

293
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,313
It's good, Masato. It feels good.

294
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:24,751
You're almost there.

295
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:29,590
No don't, coming. I'm coming!

296
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:38,670
You liked it, didn't you?

297
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:44,582
Honoka, you should've joined us.

298
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:50,644
Honoka.

299
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:52,620
Honoka!

300
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:54,758
Honoka!
