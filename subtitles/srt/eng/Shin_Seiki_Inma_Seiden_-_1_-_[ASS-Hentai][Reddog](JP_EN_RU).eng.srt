1
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,815
The stars have landed.

2
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:17,743
Inma Seiden

3
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:22,886
Hey, do you know students at
our Academy have been attacked recently?

4
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,150
I know!

5
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:27,887
Rumor has it, the girls who left
school voluntarily or are long absent...

6
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:31,692
...were actually attacked
by a giant with a facemask.

7
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:34,563
I heard he is called the Iron Mask.

8
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:38,527
Look, look. Miss Kaori is about to swim.

9
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,638
Ready.

10
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:46,469
Wonderful, Miss Kaori!

11
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:52,518
Miss Kaori is awesome. Living
as a daughter of the Academy Principal.

12
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:57,080
Oh, no! Miss Himiko
is the Acting Principal now.

13
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:59,421
Oh, isn't she Miss Kaori's aunt?

14
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:12,233
Nice swim, Sis.

15
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,487
Say, Sis.

16
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:31,290
What happened to
your Archery Club practice?

17
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:33,792
If you don't participate
in the club activities...

18
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,159
...you won't be a good example
for everybody else.

19
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,926
Well, Sena is in the Swimming Club.

20
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,293
She looked somewhat sick today.

21
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:45,930
So I came to take a look with Moeka.
Right, Moeka?

22
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,663
What? Yes. Hello.

23
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,903
Sena is not here.

24
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:56,407
Miss Ohtori, do you have
any idea what happened?

25
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:01,081
Well, let me see.
What about Mr. Iron Mask?

26
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,585
Isn't everybody talking about him?

27
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:09,124
Whenever someone disappears,
it's blamed on Mr. Iron Mask.

28
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,127
- Let's go, Moeka.
- Mao!

29
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:17,028
Did I say something weird, Bodai?

30
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,031
You could take her a little more seriously.

31
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,404
They're acting too openly these days.

32
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:29,141
The rumor is spreading,
even amongst the students, Akira.

33
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:33,546
This sure is a problem.

34
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:38,015
My Lady is a little too straight-laced
to be your sister.

35
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:41,320
Oh, that is a nice thing to say.

36
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:44,687
Until we know for sure
what Aunt Himiko has in mind...

37
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:47,198
...I wouldn't want to involve Mao.

38
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:50,264
- Do you understand?
- Sure.

39
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:53,531
Should I look into it?

40
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:02,838
You look like you're in pain, Sena.

41
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:08,748
You want to be
relieved of the pain, don't you?

42
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,785
Then accept me.

43
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,886
What?

44
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:19,153
Who are you?

45
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:37,481
What?

46
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:49,086
No!

47
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:55,997
Stop it. Please.

48
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,815
You're inside my energy shield.

49
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:13,614
No!

50
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:20,450
Resistance is futile.

51
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:41,945
No. Mao, help!

52
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:35,400
About ready now.
Come, the Great Commander King!

53
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,308
No!

54
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:10,867
No...

55
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:10,462
No more!

56
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:26,241
I found the First Sheath.

57
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,216
What?

58
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:46,661
Personally, I wouldn't mind
leaving you alone.

59
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:51,233
But I'd hate to see My Lady sad.

60
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:07,410
Help me, Mao...

61
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:10,281
You failed. How can you show your face?

62
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,187
You had to lose her
to Yashagami of all people.

63
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,696
You've caused so much trouble.
In the first place, you are...

64
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:21,097
Oasa! Don't worry.

65
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:24,202
Kaori and others haven't realized
what the Sheaths mean.

66
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,797
- Yes.
- Sagawa, I hope you're aware.

67
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:30,273
I will not tolerate any more failure.

68
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:32,072
Next time, I won't.

69
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:50,693
Mr. Yashagami, you have to explain this.

70
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:53,632
Ms. Matsumoto...

71
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:57,726
...are you thinking that I was in
the girls' bathroom with Miss Yamamoto?

72
00:10:57,804 --> 00:11:01,069
Don't be silly!
I'm not even suggesting that.

73
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,974
I couldn't say this
when Miss Ohtori was around...

74
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:07,535
...but Miss Yamamoto was raped.

75
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:12,814
- You knew it, didn't you?
- Well, sort of.

76
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:16,846
She's not the first one.

77
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:20,256
I haven't been here long, but...

78
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:23,318
...I have already taken care
of rape victims here.

79
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:27,564
But then all of them
have disappeared from this school.

80
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:31,469
Why does the Academy keep this secret?

81
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:37,639
You used to have a teacher
named Minako Yamato before I arrived.

82
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:41,941
- I wonder what's happened to her.
- You're thinking too much.

83
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:45,416
I think you should talk directly to
the Academy Principal...

84
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:46,918
...regarding such matters.

85
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:52,253
Mao, why don't we go visit Sena now?

86
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,919
Moeka, go ahead to the infirmary.

87
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:59,695
I have something
I want to check out on my own.

88
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:02,462
- But...
- Do as I say!

89
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:06,799
If someone's playing tricks,
I won't forgive him.

90
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:08,772
Ladies' Room

91
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:21,749
What? How?

92
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:34,088
Leave them alone, Hitomi,
I thought you hated them.

93
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:37,867
None of my business, I know.

94
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:46,673
What could be the purpose of
such a energy shield?

95
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:49,738
I'll find out who did this and punish him.

96
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:51,213
There!

97
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:03,087
These things... Why so many?

98
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:11,492
Who is it?

99
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:15,472
You...?

100
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:19,305
No way. You're from the Land of Death.

101
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:30,721
Gold Steel Blossom!

102
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:41,664
No way.

103
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:37,820
Hitomi?

104
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:52,804
Ouch.

105
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:58,101
Hitomi, why?

106
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:04,610
I'm your cousin, don't you dare
show yourself to me when you're pathetic.

107
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:08,313
Besides, my mother
would be sad to see you like that.

108
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:10,252
She will be sad.

109
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:13,222
Auntie would be?

110
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:15,721
Hitomi, tell me.

111
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:20,893
What is that Iron Mask?
He is not an ordinary God.

112
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,959
- He must be...
- You make me so irritated.

113
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:27,065
Hey, wait for me.

114
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:37,610
That was close.
Had Mao been captured by him...

115
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:40,083
...things would have been quite difficult.

116
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:42,882
I'm sorry.
It was a rather complicated situation.

117
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:48,083
But I never imagined
Miss Hitomi would help out My Lady.

118
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:52,059
Auntie must have her own plans.

119
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:55,425
Whatever she is after, this is my Academy.

120
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:58,436
I don't intend to let her get away with
whatever she wants.

121
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:03,032
It's okay by me so long as My Lady is safe.

122
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,875
By the way, Mr. Yashagami.

123
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:09,979
This is a girls' shower room.

124
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:13,541
Is it? Oh, well.

125
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:17,982
You got me.

126
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:20,024
Principal!

127
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,821
No matter what you say...

128
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:25,386
...Ms. Yamato resigned
and left this Academy.

129
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:28,192
I don't know what's become of her.

130
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:30,292
Don't you even care?

131
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:35,033
Minako, Ms. Yamato would not
simply disappear without a word.

132
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,335
You and Ms. Yamato.

133
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:43,010
Do you two have something going on?

134
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:45,612
Something...?

135
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:50,685
Saeko, you're very attractive
when you're upset.

136
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,619
Can I call you Saeko from now on?

137
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,792
Excuse me!

138
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:20,841
No...

139
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:25,348
Rikako? Rikako!

140
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:28,059
Rikako!

141
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:30,291
Rikako!

142
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:33,693
Rikako? Rikako!

143
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:43,605
- Rikako.
- No.

144
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:46,406
My name is Minako. Minako Yamato.

145
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,141
I'm not Rikako. No, don't!

146
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:51,647
- Rikako.
- No, I'm not!

147
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:57,656
No!

148
00:17:58,591 --> 00:17:59,990
Don't.

149
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:04,453
No!

150
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:08,325
Stop it already. I don't want it.

151
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:20,237
Rikako, it's so good!

152
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:23,915
No more. Not any more.

153
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:37,353
So? Is your father still alive?

154
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:41,663
He's in a prison,
he's got nothing else to do.

155
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:45,195
He must be raping her
whenever he's awake.

156
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:52,474
I wonder what it's like
to get laid by a man.

157
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:57,979
Listen, Hitomi.

158
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,515
I'll be the first man to lay you, you got it?

159
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:05,351
Don't sleep with other men before I do you.

160
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,960
I should've let Mao get raped.

161
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:16,295
If you want, I can go kidnap her
and lock her in the prison with your father.

162
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:20,164
It got in my ear. Oops.
It's not coming out!

163
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:27,106
Let's go home,
Mao and I will take you home.

164
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,878
But how can I explain
what happened to Mom and Dad?

165
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:35,981
You just got sick and fell in the bathroom.

166
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:39,190
Happens all the time, right?

167
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,916
You say that because you don't know.

168
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:44,895
Sena...

169
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:49,230
I've got an idea. Sena, Moeka, why
don't you spend the night at my house?

170
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:53,097
- At the Ohtori mansion?
- What do you think, Sena?

171
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:56,433
You have nothing to worry about
at my home no matter what happens.

172
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:59,273
We'll have Sis and Akira...

173
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:02,508
No, Mr. Yashagami with us.
What do you think?

174
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:05,942
Yeah.

175
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:09,586
What do you mean,
no matter what happens?

176
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:12,146
Don't worry about it. Let's go.

177
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:24,999
- Hey. What is it?
- Shh!

178
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:26,797
Who is it?

179
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:42,481
No!

180
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:46,091
Force field!

181
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:56,267
- What are these?
- No.

182
00:20:57,236 --> 00:21:00,034
Sena was attacked by these.

183
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,310
Come, Inma, Great Commander King!

184
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:18,585
Damn!

185
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:08,334
No!

186
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:21,945
- Moeka.
- How dare you attack Sena!

187
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:29,383
Moeka, no!

188
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:33,888
Oh, no...

189
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,804
Naughty girls.

190
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:47,640
Women shouldn't be
in a place like this so late at night.

191
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:55,982
- Akira!
- Mr. Yashagami.

192
00:22:57,523 --> 00:23:00,583
I'm not willing to fight a King, but...

193
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,161
...I can't forgive it for tormenting My Lady.

194
00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:07,289
Watch out, Akira, he's powerful!

195
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:10,062
You don't have to worry, My Lady.

196
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:13,635
I'm stronger than you are.

197
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:35,360
I'd think an extended battle
may be problematic.

198
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:37,327
I shall get rid of it once.

199
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,156
Present!

200
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:45,498
Warrior!

201
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:48,773
Fight!

202
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:50,230
Human!

203
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,101
All!

204
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:55,411
Post! Rip!

205
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:58,308
Be! Forward!

206
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,115
Awesome!

207
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:12,262
Sena...

208
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,728
Sena!

209
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:24,974
Bastard!

210
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:27,775
My Lady!

211
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:40,758
What is this?
The Temple of the Peacock God?

212
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:44,824
Sena!

213
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:48,022
An energy shield.

214
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,461
Sena, wake up! Sena! Wake up, Sena!

215
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:27,498
So good.

216
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,305
More! It feels good!

217
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:32,440
Sena! Sena!

218
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:35,140
More...

219
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,077
Stop it! Sena!

220
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:09,876
No!

221
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,780
On!

222
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:34,329
Here is one.

223
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:38,070
Sena!

224
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:43,541
Sena! It's all right, Sena!

225
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:49,018
Sena! Come on, Sena!
Open your eyes, Sena!

226
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:54,653
Sena! Come on, Sena!
Open your eyes, Sena!

227
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:59,361
Sena, open your eyes. Sena!
