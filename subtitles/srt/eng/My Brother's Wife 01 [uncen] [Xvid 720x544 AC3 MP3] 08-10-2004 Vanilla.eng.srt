Takashi...

4
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,626
Takashi! You're going to be late.

5
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,492
Hurry up and get dressed. Breakfast is ready.

6

For Heaven sake, when are you going
to be able to get up on your own?

8
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,280
At this rate, you'll never be able to
get a decent job in the real world.

9

<i>But the reason i hate my brother most is</i>...

18
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,727
...<i>because he made Miwa his own</i>.

19

Good morning Takashi.

24
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,361
Good morning.

25
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,568
Owww... That hurt!

26
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,902
Wake up already! Jeez...

27
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,810
That doesn't mean you have to hit me!

28
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,048
I didn't hit you. I slowly
swung my bag at you.

29
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,785
Anybody else would have dodged it.

30
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,414
Stop trying to flirt with me already!

31
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,621
You are so conceited!

32
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:44,359
Why would I, the hottest girl at
our school, make a move on you!

33
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,728
Then leave me alone. This is just bullying.

34
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,400
Did you just realize that? You're
really something Takashi.

35
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,536
What? Are you angry?

36
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,738
You need to lighten up. You're
not like your brother at all.

37
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,944
I wonder why Satoshi married her?

38
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,717
<i>This little demon is Miwa's</i>

Hey! Don't leave me behind! You're
supposed to be my bug repellent!

00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,868
We can't have a pest following around

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,487
No, I didn't. You shouldn't

Oh, fine then. I guess our

Oh. It's nothing.

73

You got a 93 on the
math test this time, right?

74
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,414
You made simple math
mistakes and got two wrong.

75
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,748
It's too bad. You could have gotten a 100.

76
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,617
You need to take things more
seriously and stop daydreaming.

77
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,964
Your brother Satoshi
would have gotten a 100.

00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,664
But you're you, so you

You shouldn't be doing this

115
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,933
I want your dick.

116

132
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,040
I'm telling the truth.

133

I don't like people who
can't make up their mind.

I thought so...

136
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,116

and you thought I was him.

139
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,924
I was only a replacement for
him, wasn't I? For my brother...

140
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:19,764
But I knew it was you inside the taxi.

I dated your brother, but
that was a long time ago.

You just have to polish it.

Satoshi has, but it's your own.

You need to have more confidence.

I got it! I'll make you shine!

146
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,463

00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:32,405
Honey, he's okay, so...
I'm sure Takashi is sorry.

158
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,805
Be quiet.

159
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,938
I have a responsibility to raise
him to be a decent human being.

160
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:41,811
What's that look on your face!

161
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,952
If there's something you want to say, say it!

162
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:46,749
Nothing.

163
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,757
I'll call next time. All right?

164
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,128
Wait! I said, wait!

165
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,732
I'm sorry. Can we just let it go?

166
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,600
Come on. Takashi apologized so...

167
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,840
Don't ever make us worry like that again!

168
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,337
<i>I knew It was my fault, but</i>...

169
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:16,113
<i>I couldn't tell him where I was and</i>
<i>my brother's words made me angry</i>.

170
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,959
<i>I have a responsibility to raIse</i>
<i>him to be a decent human being</i>.

171
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,685
<i>Mind your own business</i>!

172
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,127
It's me. I'm coming in, okay?

173
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,167
Sure.

174
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,296
You haven't eaten yet, right?

175
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,906
Your brother left already. Make sure you eat.

176
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,037
Your brother was really worried about you.

177
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,043
You two are family, so make
sure you call next time.

178
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,613
I'm sorry.

179
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,118
Oh that's right. Misa was really worried too.

180
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,094
Give her a call, okay?

181
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,029
It's Sunday, so get some rest.

182
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,266
Okay.

183
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,208
First, we need to do
something about your hair.

184
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,309
Let's get it cut at the salon I go to.

185
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,746
You're not a bad looking guy, so
you'll be okay even if it's a bit flashy.

186
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,259
I think this might look good.
Yup! It looks great on you.

187
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:34,024
From now on, you need to
go to trendy places like this.

188
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,664
See! Everyone's looking at you.

189
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,105
I'm home.

190
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,373
Welcome hom- Takashi?!

191
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,775
What happened to you?!

192
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,480
Does it look strange?

193
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,082
Of course not! It really
suits you. You look great!

194
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,080
Good.

195
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,785
You stayed out the entire night
and now this. What's going on?

196
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,893
Did something happen?

197
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:08,965
There's someone I've had
on my mind lately so...

198
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:15,737
What a lucky girl... I wonder
what kind of person she is?

199
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:21,977
<i>'It's you, Miwa.' That's what I wanted to say</i>.

200
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,323
Oh no! And I'm still not done.

201
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,824
I should go wash my face.

202
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,669
S... Sorry!

203
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,116
I saw it...

204
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:01,977
Miwa's...

205
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,152
...naked body.

206
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:15,026
<i>That night, I was too excited</i>
<i>and had troubIe fallng asleep</i>.

207
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:40,782
M... Miwa! But... I...

208
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,074
By the way, what time is it now?

209
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,750
<i>1 2:30. Were you still sleeping?</i>

210
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:44,380
Yeah...

211
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,054
<i>You better not have shown</i>
<i>my picture to anyone</i>!

212
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,052
Are you worried?

213
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,157
<i>Jeez</i>! <i>That's enough</i>!

214
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,865
Then you need to listen to what l say.

215
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,698
<i>Fine. Five more days</i>.

216
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,301
Getting down to business...
l want to see your breasts.

217
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,106
I have to study so I'll be waiting.

218
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,771
<i>Yeah, yeah. Good night</i>.

219
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,883
Right there... There... If you play
with the outer side of the clit...

220
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,456
...most women will writhe in pleasure!

221
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,989
No! Stop! I...

222
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,593
Class time is over.

223
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,168
I want it from behind.

224
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,101
Please stick your cock all the way inside me.

225
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,618
Takashi... More! More!

226
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:59,289
That's... No! It's embarrassing!
I can't anymore...

227
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,700
l'm going to cum again!

228
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,609
Takashi, you were amazing. You have talent.

229
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:20,913
I don't think so...

230
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,489
Today, a bunch of the female
students were talking about you.

231
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,250
They were saying how
handsome you look now.

232
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,559
I got kind of jealous.

233
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:45,308
Yeah?

234
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:48,878
What?

235
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:50,314
Nothing...

236
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,712
I thought I might have said a
little too much the other day...

237
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,184
It's okay. I'm not upset about it. .

238
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,421
We only have each other. How do I say...

239
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,457
We need to be there for each other.

240
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,395
Yeah, I know.

241
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,787
Good. I'll be on my way now.

242
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,530
By the way, did something
happen between you and Miwa?

243
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,535
You guys weren't talking much during dinner.

244
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,172
No, it's nothing.

245
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,510
Good. I want you get along with Miwa.

246
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,373
I know you had a thing for her at one time.

247
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:24,243
See you.

248
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,542
<i>He knew</i>!

249
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:33,389
<i>He knew I was Infatuated with</i>
<i>Miwa but he took her for himseIf</i>.

250
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,490
<i>I won't forgive him. I won't forgive him</i>.

251
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,930
<i>I'm going to have my revenge</i>! <i>I'm</i>
<i>going to take her away from him</i>!

252
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,464
I'll be away on a business trip for three days,

253
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,929
but call me on my cell if anything happens.

254
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,567
I'll be fine. Takashi will be here too.

255
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,675
Okay. Off I go then.

256
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:53,770
Have a safe trip.

257
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,510
<i>Good. I'm goIng to go</i>
<i>ahead wIth my plan tonight</i>!

258
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,431
What? Did you want to go in first?

259
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,264
Please! Get out! No!

260
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,171
Do you know who's been on my mind?

261
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,908
Yes, it's you Miwa!

262
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,743
You always talked to me in the morning.

263
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:39,386
Those moments were the happiest
moments in my boring days.

264
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,994
I understand. I understand, so
let's talk in the living room.

265
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:51,135
But my brother... He can do
everything better than me, but...

266
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,605
He stole you away from me! That's
why I'm going to take you back.

267
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,301
This is my revenge.

268
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,076
I'll scream!

269
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,738
You know you can't!

270
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,806
Do you want the neighbors to find out
about such an embarrassing thing?

271
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:14,219
Fine... Then... Just with my mouth...

272
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,358
<i>I've waited for this moment for so long</i>!

273
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,674
<i>Miwa, I really love you. More</i>
<i>than anyone else in the world</i>.

274
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,313
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

275
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,583
<i>I'm gettIng wet. I can't be</i>... <i>But</i>... <i>But</i>...

276
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,250
<i>I want It</i>....

277
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:58,024
Miwa, l can't hold myself back
anymore. You feel the same way right?

278
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:05,701
No, l told you all I'll do is lick
you. You'll have to cum with this.

279
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,544
No! I can't hold it anymore! I
want to feel your everything!

280
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,750
I can't anymore!

281
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,619
No! Not that! Stop!

282
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,891
No! Stop! No!

283
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,261
No... No...
