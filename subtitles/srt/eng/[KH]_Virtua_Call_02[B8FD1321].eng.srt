1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:09,442
What do you call this, Emily?
To Kunihiko, Emily is just a child.

2
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,077
Because I was worried about you,

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,381
I introduced him to a Virtuacall
girlfriend, right?

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,383
I was just teasing you a little,

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,886
but what's so great about a guy
who just dizzily follows?

6
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:23,390
And you were saying that's he's
just a brotherly type?

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,558
Were you serious, Emily?

8
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,260
Good luck to the both of you!

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,888
If you don't hurry, your first love
will go away!

10
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:03,287
Emily, you waited for me?

11
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,331
Sorry! Sorry!

12
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,801
Was Suzune okay?

13
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,703
Yeah! She can't drink, but she drank a
whole bunch, and got dizzy, she said.

14
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,840
Good, I'm glad it wasn't worse.

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,638
Oh, and I thought I'd let you know...

16
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,740
I'm going to go out with her.

17
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,877
It's all because of you, Emily.
Thank you.

18
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,285
Really?

19
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,344
It's great that your feelings reached her.

20
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:31,724
This summer, you work hard, and
get a good man too, right?

21
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:35,421
If that happens, then dress smart,
and let's go on a double date!

22
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,396
I'm so sleepy! So sleepy!
Guess I'll take a nap!

23
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,366
Brother...

24
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,306
Virtuacall 2,

25
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,941
Access 2.

26
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,910
To You, My True Feelings.

27
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,628
Wow! That had a good ending, didn't it?

28
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,863
I guess so.

29
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,161
I guess that's what they call serendipity.

30
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,435
What's wrong, Emily?

31
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:22,075
You're upset that Kunihiko got laid, right?

32
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,168
It's not really like that!

33
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:30,283
"How unfair! I'm so jealous!
Give back my brother!"

34
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,251
That's written all over your face.

35
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,548
I don't care!

36
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,292
Well...

37
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,035
Don't come near me! GO AWAY!

38
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,068
Oh no, she is seriously in love.

39
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,653
I'm the boss here.

40
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:34,614
Suzune?

41
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,415
Yes?

42
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,384
Was the movie too childish for you?

43
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,649
No, that's not true.
It was pretty interesting.

44
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,092
Popcorn while watching a movie makes you
feel like, "I really watched a movie!"

45
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,660
And then I get really into it.

46
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,631
Oh yeah, I come here every once
in a while, but this shop...

47
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:55,268
This one, this one! The blueberry cake
and the cold mocha java are the best!

48
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,726
I've tried this too.
This combination is pretty good.

49
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,571
Do you come her a lot with Emily?

50
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,611
That Emily makes me go to
the movies with her,

51
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,981
and the course is pretty much
to go here afterwards.

52
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,950
If you turn her down, she gets mad.
It's really a pain!

53
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,346
That makes me a little jealous.

54
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:20,226
Hasegawa, when you talk about Emily,
somehow you seem really happy.

55
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,828
You're misunderstanding!

56
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,896
She's just like a little sister to me.

57
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:27,133
She's always around, so she just kind of
comes out in my conversation.

58
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,369
But it's not that kind of relationship.

59
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,532
That's okay. You don't have to get
so flustered about it.

60
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,637
Sorry.

61
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,279
Why the sad face, Brother?

62
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,556
My intention was to show
Suzune a good time.

63
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:54,424
It just seemed that the date
wasn't very exciting.

64
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,131
That time, we just got caught up in
everything and that happened,

65
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,300
but since then, we haven't even kissed.

66
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,834
Get a hold of yourself!

67
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,671
If you keep thinking that way, you'll just
make yourself insecure again.

68
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,841
I just get so weird when
I'm around Suzune.

69
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,978
Brother, are you sending her signals?

70
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,279
Signals?

71
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,511
Yeah, signals. Getting the hang of it is
important with things like that.

72
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,858
That's all wrong! That stupid face will
make her feelings calm down!

73
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,162
So look in the mirror, and do
some more research!

74
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,823
Emily?

75
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,296
What are you so mad about?

76
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:55,321
What's wrong with me? Why Emily?

77
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,257
Right now my head should be
full of Suzune.

78
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:02,028
I should be thinking about how to make
things go well with Suzune, and...

79
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,724
The Virtucall is still here?

80
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,992
All right, just once more,
to change my mood.

81
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,341
No, I can't! I already have
my heart set on Suzune.

82
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,044
How could I show such a pathetic
perverted character?

83
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,740
That Virtuacall thing...

84
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,640
Sorry, Suzune!

85
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,859
I'll make tonight the last time.

86
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,198
Hi, welcome to Virtuacall!

87
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,969
From here on out, everything depends
only on your charm and...

88
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,164
Enough with the explanations already!

89
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:57,415
Hello, I'm Kunihiko Hasegawa.
What's your name?

90
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:02,377
I'm Chisato Haragataka. Nice to meet you.

91
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,358
You don't look it, but you have a
very polite personality.

92
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,498
Hasegawa, what is your occupation?

93
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,800
Me?

94
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,462
I'm still a college student.
I'm in my fourth year, though.

95
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:21,407
Then it's an important time for you,
looking for a job and all.

96
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,609
Good luck, Hasegawa!

97
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,975
Oh, thank you.

98
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,816
This isn't good. I don't get the feel.
I think I'll change people.

99
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:33,820
Sorry, I just remembered something
I have to do right now.

100
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,947
Talking with me is...

101
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,953
It's boring, right?

102
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,530
Everyone says so.

103
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,194
They say I talk like a manual,
and that's boring.

104
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,563
Well, bye-bye!

105
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,365
Wait a minute.

106
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,443
I do have time now after all.
Shall we meet somewhere?

107
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,144
Hasegawa!

108
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,963
You're a stewardess?

109
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,766
Yes, that's right.

110
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,837
But time is scarce with that
kind of job, right?

111
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,306
There's not much of a chance
to even meet people.

112
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:31,766
Even if I do find someone I like, I can't
make time to see them as I wish.

113
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,573
Sorry, I'm getting depressing.
Tonight, let's drink!

114
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,579
Yeah.

115
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,590
Seen from here,

116
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:50,551
the airport looks kind of like a space
station floating in the galaxy, right?

117
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,906
Hey, lady!

118
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,000
My sense of smell has sniffed you out!

119
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,713
Miss, let's burn rubber in my Caddy.

120
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,613
Yeah, burn rubber!

121
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,051
Mizushima!

122
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,987
Oh? Is that you, Hasegawa?
Is she your woman, then?

123
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,423
It's not like that with her.

124
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,689
Then there's no problem if we
partake of her, right?

125
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,327
Miss, what is your name?

126
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,132
Quit it, Mizushima. She doesn't like it.

127
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,838
Stop using violence!

128
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,483
You... You can't be!

129
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:56,155
Hasegawa, you remember this!

130
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,997
Mizushima, she's dangerous.

131
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,728
I know that!

132
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,098
Take this!

133
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,134
Save us!

134
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,175
Sorry, that must've surprised you.

135
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,508
Eighty percent of my body is artificial.

136
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:57,445
Thank you, Kunihiko.
I feel refreshed after rioting a little.

137
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,751
Say, Kunihiko?

138
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,563
Do you want to have sex?

139
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,224
Sex?

140
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,630
I've decided to throw away the
boring me for tonight.

141
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,304
Don't worry.

142
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:16,542
That part is the twenty percent.

143
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,204
That part, you say?

144
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,559
Chisato, this isn't right.

145
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,328
I have a girlfriend, and this kind of thing...

146
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,238
Just an adventure for the evening.

147
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,641
And besides this is quite

148
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,905
engorged, isn't it?

149
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,881
My sense of reason flies away.

150
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,248
Suzune, I'm sorry! Forgive me!

151
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:05,984
Good!

152
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:13,925
Good...

153
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,166
Hasegawa, from the back...

154
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,252
Harder, please.

155
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,717
Good...

156
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,461
I feel it, I feel it!

157
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,927
Good!

158
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,233
I... anymore...

159
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,339
Here I come!

160
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,205
Inside! Come inside me, please!

161
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,618
I'm coming!

162
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:24,601
My Lady, are you going to buy
something else?

163
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,200
It's cute, isn't it? What's the problem?

164
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,802
It's my gentle revenge on Papa and Mama.

165
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,511
Emily...

166
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,514
Suzune!

167
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,586
What's the matter?
You're buying quite a bit.

168
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:47,885
I'm leaving Japan soon. To tell the truth,
I was a foreign student.

169
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,497
Isn't Brother with you today?

170
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,234
No. More importantly, does Hasegawa
know you're leaving?

171
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,564
It's okay. He's just a neighbor.

172
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,377
He's clumsy, kind of dense and tactless,

173
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,938
but there aren't so many straightforward
nice guys like him.

174
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,475
Suzune, please take good care of Brother!

175
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:17,278
Emily, shouldn't you be more honest
about your feelings?

176
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,386
I'm just like a little sister, so...

177
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,163
Because of my homeland's customs,

178
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,933
my life in Japan has ended with
my eighteenth birthday.

179
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:32,063
I'm the only candidate to succeed to
the Welfenland throne.

180
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,406
I don't have anymore time!

181
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:38,604
Father, Mother and my
countrymen are waiting.

182
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,864
Who is it? It's open!

183
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,437
Geez! Who IS it?

184
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,841
Wait a minute, okay?

185
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,877
Yes?

186
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,674
Emily, what's up?

187
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,207
You...

188
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,418
Brother, let's go on a date!

189
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,921
Date? Even if you say so all of a sudden...

190
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,456
It's okay, it's okay! Hurry up!

191
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,754
I'm making my last memories, so...

192
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,428
Making memories? You?

193
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,164
Don't ask stupid questions! Now, hurry!

194
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:32,831
We're going! Going!

195
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:33,798
Emily!
We're going! Going!

196
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,116
Brother?

197
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,095
Oh, a yukata?

198
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,496
They still had sparklers.

199
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,208
Emily, did something happen to you?

200
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,115
It's strange.

201
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:06,513
All of a sudden, you dress up, cause a big
fuss, make me take you everywhere...

202
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,992
Is it something that you can't tell me?

203
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,294
Brother!

204
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,959
Emily?

205
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,707
The end.

206
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,204
I'm tired already today,
so I'm going home, okay?

207
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,678
Good night, Brother!

208
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,384
Emily...

209
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,603
Field House

210
00:17:55,874 --> 00:18:00,937
It seems you've finally realized who the
person most important to you is.

211
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:06,251
Suzune, I've thought of Emily as
a little sister all this time.

212
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,253
To be honest, I'm hesitant.

213
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,984
It's something that happens often.
I finally realized it too.

214
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,028
Anyone who loves will have worries,
and become hesitant.

215
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,297
But I think it's really quite easy.

216
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,357
Bless your soul without any reservations.

217
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:29,030
Wonderful!
You say such beautiful things, Suzune!

218
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,709
I've finally opened my eyes.

219
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:36,174
What do you want with Suzune, now?
Think about what you did to her!

220
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,351
I'm not talking to you, Hasegawa.

221
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,086
It's all right, Hasegawa.

222
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,144
But...

223
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,686
The one I really like is you.

224
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,326
Suzune!

225
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:51,130
I wanted to speak with
this person once more.

226
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,792
And so that's how it is, Hasegawa.

227
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,340
I'm not so stupid that I'd make
the same mistake twice.

228
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:11,683
Hasegawa, before she leaves Japan,
you have to express your true feelings.

229
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,015
Leaves Japan? Who is?

230
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,719
What? You still don't know about
Emily leaving the country?

231
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,754
Leaving the country?

232
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,658
Making my last memories...

233
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,966
Suzune, thank you!

234
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:42,169
Maybe I acted a little too cool?
I'm pretty clumsy with people too.

235
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:48,487
Oh, what a beautiful foot!

236
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,556
Please pick on me some more!

237
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,524
Quit it already!

238
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,129
More! More!

239
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,620
Just a little more!

240
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,532
Emily!

241
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,247
My Lady,

242
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:22,043
the paperwork is done.
Shall we drink tea while we wait?

243
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,985
Yes.

244
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,070
Forgive me, Emliy.

245
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,572
I didn't even know your feelings!

246
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,574
I won't see you again, just like that?

247
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,135
Emily, you could have at least
discussed it with me!

248
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,416
Mister, I'll get off here.
Keep the change!

249
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,384
Sorry, about that, Sir.

250
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,719
Only twenty bucks?

251
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,255
Hey, boy! You're short ten bucks!
Ten bucks!

252
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:07,633
Damn, why was Emily silent?
Was that all our relationship was?

253
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,658
What was I to you?!

254
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,438
My Lady?

255
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,581
Shall we go?

256
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,387
Emily, where are you? Where are you?

257
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,369
...Welfendland, please gather at Gate 5.

258
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,211
Brother? Brother!

259
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,213
Emily!

260
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,493
Brother!

261
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,665
Brother!

262
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,731
Emily!

263
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,071
Brother!

264
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,134
No, Brother!

265
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,509
Emily!

266
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,942
You idiot, why did you try to go
without saying anything?

267
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:41,248
I still haven't told you how I really feel!

268
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,631
Emily, I...

269
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,371
I like you.

270
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,929
I love you!

271
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,210
I like you, Brother.

272
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,373
No, I really like Kunihiko!

273
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:05,777
Emily, you're beautiful.

274
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,447
Please be gentle with me.

275
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,282
Emily...

276
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:14,114
It's hot down there!
It keeps getting hotter.

277
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,018
Good!

278
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,830
I can't anymore... I'm going to come!

279
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,498
Me too.

280
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,365
Kunihiko, me too!

281
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:44,282
As it turns out, I've been a freeloader
in Kunihiko's room ever since then.

282
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:48,854
Miraculously he graduated,
and we got engaged.

283
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,984
We'll have our wedding in Welfenland.

284
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,828
What an amazing castle!

285
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:00,799
I'll be the crown prince of a whole country!
Maybe even King?

286
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,960
Lucky! Lucky!

287
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:17,012
Welcome to Welfenland.
As ruler of the country, I welcome you.

288
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,219
You're the ruler of the country?

289
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:25,679
Kunihiko, what are you saying? Of course
Mama is the ruler of the country!

290
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,595
Leadership of Welfenland is based on
a succession of women.

291
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:34,933
The kingship is too, but the high-ranking
positions are held by women.

292
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,369
It's not a custom of putting men over
women, but rather women over men.

293
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,036
That's right, the custom of putting
women above men.

294
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:38,570
Woman
That's right, the custom of putting
women above men.

295
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,571
Exalted
That's right, the custom of putting
women above men.

296
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,338
Man
That's right, the custom of putting
women above men.

297
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,439
Lowly
That's right, the custom of putting
women above men.

298
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,337
That's right, the custom of putting
women above men.

299
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,705
Didn't I tell you?

300
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:53,418
Well, Kunihiko, it's good that you've come.

301
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,785
Now, I no longer have to feel so lonely
and low.

302
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,388
Putting women above men?

303
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,855
Don't feel so bad!

304
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,736
