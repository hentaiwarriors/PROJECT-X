1
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,640
Mommy!

2
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,150
I feel so refreshed!

3
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,120
Well, that'll last me at least two weeks.

4
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:17,710
Trouble Evocation 2

5
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,770
Right there. Yes, it's amazing.

6
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,860
It's hitting me so deeply.

7
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,020
Does it feel that good?

8
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,400
Yes, it's absolutely amazing.

9
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,740
Ria!

10
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,660
Master, how do you like my pussy?

11
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,540
It's great.

12
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,500
Master, I'm reaching my limit.

13
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,000
No, I can't take it anymore!

14
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,920
Me too!
No, I can't take it anymore!

15
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,170
No, I can't take it anymore!

16
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,170
Master! Master!

17
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:57,960
Ria!
Master! Master!

18
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,650
Master!

19
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,690
Master!

20
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,210
I'm going!

21
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,010
Master, your bag!

22
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,010
Thanks, Ria.

23
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,390
Now, time to clean.

24
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,110
This is my Master's...

25
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,240
What am I thinking about?

26
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,420
Let's see.

27
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,220
I have lots of time today, so I'll make roast beef.

28
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,550
You never change, Ria.

29
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,390
Who's there?

30
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,310
Sadina? It's you, isn't it!?

31
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,730
I didn't expect you to come here.

32
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,610
Don't touch me like nothing has happened.

33
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,160
What?

34
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,830
Why? We've been friends since childhood.

35
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,540
Ria, what are you even thinking?

36
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,300
I came to this world right after you.

37
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,430
I've already carried out several contracts and been promoted to noble demon, fourth class.

38
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,930
And in the meantime, you haven't even finished one mission, much less been awarded a promotion.

39
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,940
It's already been several months since you made a contract with that human named Yoshino.

40
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,480
And yet...

41
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,320
You have no excuses.

42
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,410
Unlike me, you're the daughter of a grand noble.

43
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,530
You're the successor to the demon noble family of Godzuike.

44
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,540
Umm... Sading, I'm not sure I get your point.

45
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:48,380
Our mission is to fulfill the three wishes of the person who summoned us.

46
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,260
The reason I'm living here is that it's one of my Master's wishes.

47
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,398
And we already exchanged vows according to our custom,

48
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:02,018
and my Master satisfies me, so...

49
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,320
W-Wait a minute, Ria.

50
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,150
Do you actually understand the rules for missions and contracts?

51
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,950
Unless you take the human's soul,

52
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:16,830
withing six months, six days, and six hours of making a contract in that world's time,

53
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,080
you'll be disqualified.

54
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,790
And that's not all.

55
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,380
If you fail now, you'll lose your right to succeed the Godzuike family for eternity.

56
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,590
Did you know that?

57
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,630
That can't be.

58
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,850
It's all right. You still have time.

59
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,190
I guess I can help you, too.

60
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,270
Do whatever it takes to find out his last two wishes and take his soul.

61
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,860
What's wrong, Ria?

62
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,660
What exactly will happen to Master if I take his soul?

63
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:01,080
Who knows? Humans are pretty much the same whether they have a soul or not.

64
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,830
I'm being serious, Sadina!

65
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,000
To put it simply, they become zombies.

66
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,840
They go on living without any memories or emotions.

67
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,760
What does it matter?

68
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,260
Listen, Ria.

69
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,560
You have to be the heir to your family. It's you destiny.

70
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,230
You can't forget about your responsibilities as a noble for the sake of one human male.

71
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,440
I know that, but...

72
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,410
It's just as Auntie, I mean your mother, had feared.

73
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,870
She gave me a message for you.

74
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,830
From my mother? What is it?

75
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,790
She said that if you didn't want to come back, you could stay here.

76
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,520
My mother... said that?

77
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,190
My poor little Ria.

78
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,650
I'll cheer you up.

79
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,190
S-Sadina...

80
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,280
I'll make you forget that man.

81
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
You're really enjoying this.

82
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Just look at how you're reacting.

83
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,460
Make me feel good, too.

84
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,850
Yes, that's it! Do it harder, Ria!

85
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,940
Sadina...

86
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,860
How is it, Ria?

87
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,780
Isn't it better than doing it with a human?

88
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,000
Master...

89
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,160
Ria...

90
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,790
No!

91
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,420
What?

92
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,750
I'm sorry Sadina, but...

93
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,550
If that's your decision, then you leave me no choice.

94
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,890
Sadina?

95
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,850
I'll take over from here and finish the job.

96
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,780
You'd get in my way, so I'll make you wait in there.

97
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,780
What are you planning to do, Sadina?

98
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,410
It's useless. You can't break this barrier.

99
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,410
See ya.

100
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,490
This is a noble's mantle. Why am I wearing it?

101
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,830
You like it?

102
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,960
It was our dream to wear it, remember?

103
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,080
Sadina, where are we?

104
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,420
It's a barrier I made. Not too shabby, huh?

105
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,970
My magical power has grown a lot.

106
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:31,350
Using my magic, it will be easy to make Yoshino state his last two wishes and to fulfill them.

107
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,400
Then all you'll have to do is take his soul and go back to the demon world.

108
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,730
Don't do it, Sadina!

109
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,490
Then are you going make him cancel the contract,

110
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,320
and just wait for another human to summon you?

111
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,580
Make him cancel the contract?

112
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:55,330
But if I do that, I won't ever be able to see him again.

113
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,090
Enough of that already. I'm starting to get angry.

114
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,800
Take a look over there.

115
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,360
That's...

116
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,030
Mother!

117
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,950
I don't know why you're so fixated on that man.

118
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,040
But you can't go back to the demon world until you fulfill your mission.

119
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,790
Will you throw it all away?

120
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,460
Your homeland, and your mother?

121
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,090
I see.

122
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,300
I'm going.

123
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,930
You wait here.

124
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,140
Think about everything that's happened, and what will happen from now on.

125
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,320
Sadina!

126
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,510
You really saved me. Thanks!

127
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,810
I only did my duty, Master.

128
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,600
I see. I'm always in your care, Ria.

129
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,350
Sure.

130
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,570
Mom, Dad, hurry up!

131
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,820
Wait up, Konomi!

132
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,280
Hurry, let's go!

133
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,820
You shouldn't run off like that.

134
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,200
Sorry!

135
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,870
We'll eat something tasty today.

136
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,370
I want to eat omelet rice!

137
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,670
Maybe we'll be like that some day, too.

138
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,380
Don't be silly!

139
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,130
Humans are just humans!

140
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,640
They're deceptive, selfish, and cowardly, and despite all that, they're arrogant.

141
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,600
Why would Ria...

142
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,730
Excuse me.

143
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,520
You may be right that humans are pretty worthless in general.

144
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,990
But there are some good people among them.

145
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,410
Like me, for one!

146
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,830
Y-Yes, of course.

147
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,080
Ria, you're acting strange today.

148
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,670
Really? I think it's just your imagination.

149
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,130
My imagination?

150
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,130
Yeah, maybe that's it.

151
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,090
Let's lighten the mood.

152
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,090
Ria, come with me for a bit.

153
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,510
Huh? Where to?

154
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,350
Just come along.

155
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,030
Wow, I didn't know about this place.

156
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,700
Ria, I'd like you to fulfill that wish after all.

157
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,580
That second wish I told you about a while back.

158
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,620
Um, well...

159
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,870
What's wrong?

160
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,210
I'm sorry. Master, I forgot what it was.

161
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,420
You forgot?

162
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,720
Sorry.

163
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,340
There is that.

164
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,680
How could you remember something you never heard?

165
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,060
When did you notice?

166
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,560
At the very start.

167
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,980
I sensed a magic far more powerful than Ria's.

168
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,400
You were the one who gave me that charred newt earlier, too.

169
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,490
Correct. You're pretty sharp.

170
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,450
And you made another mistake.

171
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,160
The real Ria would've shared an umbrella with me.

172
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,120
Show your true self!

173
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,010
Where is Ria!?

174
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,260
She's in here.

175
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,220
She's trapped in here.

176
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,940
It's a barrier she can't possibly break.

177
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,440
Fool, do you think a human stands a chance against a devil?

178
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,030
Return Ria to me!

179
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,330
I already told you that you can't beat me.

180
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,330
We'll see about that.

181
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,380
Wh-What is this?

182
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,220
That's a holy powder used to exorcise devils.

183
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,810
I've carried it around ever since that encounter with the newt, just in case.

184
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,770
D-Damn you!

185
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,850
Where did you get that?

186
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,560
My father is an expert in this stuff.

187
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,770
He's a worthless father, but this time I'm grateful to him.

188
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,190
Now give Ria back to me!

189
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,820
You want her that badly?

190
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,280
I guess you would. She has quite the body.

191
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,200
What?

192
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,330
What have you done with Ria!?

193
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,410
What have you done!?

194
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,880
If you want to know that badly, I'll tell you.

195
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,760
You did that to her?

196
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,230
It was an interesting show. I wanted you to see it.

197
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,110
Also, she looked like she was enjoying it.

198
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,360
That girl loves sex.

199
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,360
You bitch!

200
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,780
Now you will feel what Ria felt!

201
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,620
No!

202
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,970
Ria...

203
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,590
Ria's a devil.

204
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,720
Do you really think she can live with a human?

205
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,390
I-I don't know.

206
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:32,150
Since she's a devil, she'll only be unhappy if she remains in this world.

207
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,820
All devils, including Ria, have to go back to the demon world eventually.

208
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,610
Don't you understand?

209
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,830
Why should that matter!?

210
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,920
Give me that jewel and release her!

211
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,540
Let her...

212
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:03,090
You fool. We demons can drain the vitality from a human we have sex with.

213
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,100
I didn't think you'd fall for my trap that easily.

214
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,570
And now that I've completely recovered my magic power, I'll have to thank you properly.

215
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Now cancel your contract with Ria.

216
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,910
I refuse!

217
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Oh, really?

218
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,950
I didn't want to do it the hard way, but...

219
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,880
There's another way to free her from you.

220
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,720
If the human with whom a contract is made dies for some reason,

221
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,850
the contract is automatically nullified.

222
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,560
It may not look like it now, but I'm usually a lucky guy.

223
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,030
Hurry up and say that you've nullified your contract with Ria!

224
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,570
Otherwise, I'll...

225
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,950
No!

226
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,680
Will you throw it all away?

227
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,140
Your homeland, and your mother?

228
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,540
My, my. What happened, Ria?

229
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,550
You know, everyone says I'm bad at flying.

230
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,130
They say I'm an embarrassment to the Godzuike family.

231
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:12,720
It's not being able to fly well that makes a noble.

232
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,770
But Mom, I want to be like you!

233
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:22,150
You should just be yourself, not try to be like someone else.

234
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,530
What's important is trying to be a better you than you were yesterday.

235
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:32,410
One day, you'll grow up, and you'll have to choose your own path.

236
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,040
When that time comes, follow what your true self tells you.

237
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,850
My true self...

238
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,350
Do what I say!

239
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,690
No!

240
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:03,150
<i>How? How can a mere human resist this long?</i>

241
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,570
Ria!

242
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,910
R-Ria! You managed to break my barrier?

243
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,870
Sadina.

244
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,250
Ria...

245
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,710
Master!

246
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,420
Are you all right?

247
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,710
Ria, this will be my second wish.

248
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,760
Don't leave my side!

249
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,430
Promise to stay with me forever!

250
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,890
I can't grant you that wish.

251
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,930
Is that because you're a devil and I'm a human!?

252
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,270
That's not it.

253
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,730
It's because it's the same as your first wish.

254
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,940
As long as you don't cancel the contract, I will always be by your side.

255
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,490
Forever, no matter what happens.

256
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,200
Ria, do you understand what you're saying?

257
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,700
I've decided, Sadina.

258
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,750
Is that so.

259
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,250
Then do as you wish.

260
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,420
Sadina...

261
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,030
Sadina.

262
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,780
We'll always be friends, right?

263
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,240
Goodbye, Ria.

264
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,790
Oh, that's right.

265
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,660
One last thing...

266
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,340
Be happy.

267
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,640
Thank you, Sadina.

268
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,160
Master! Master!

269
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,210
Could you stop calling me master?

270
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,920
But...

271
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,840
My second wish is that you call me by my name.

272
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,800
I can't do that.

273
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,180
But it's my wish.

274
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,220
You know my name, right?

275
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,350
Shuuya-san.

276
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,650
Speak up so I can hear you.

277
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,070
Shuuya-san...

278
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,480
Shuuya-san!

279
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,190
Louder.

280
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,950
Shuuya-san!

281
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,950
Shuuya-san!

282
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,700
I read your report.

283
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,710
I gave you a difficult mission.

284
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,590
Thank you for your hard work.

285
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,550
I'm grateful for your kind words.

286
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,930
Let's stop with the formalities.

287
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,050
Stand up.

288
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,010
Auntie...

289
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,390
Was Ria's decision for the best?

290
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,060
Sadina...

291
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,780
Just like humans, we demons can live our lives in many different ways.

292
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,700
Ria chose her path of her own free will.

293
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,540
I'm proud of her for doing that.

294
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,670
My wish is for her to be happy...

295
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,590
no matter where she is.

296
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,340
I couldn't forgive her.

297
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,470
I thought she would make you sad.

298
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,850
And...

299
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:47,350
I thought we would always be together.

300
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,560
Sadina.

301
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,810
Shuuya-san, hurry up.

302
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:38,440
Did you really have to buy all this stuff,

303
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,240
just because we haven't gone shopping together for a while?

304
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,240
But you do look good in that dress.

305
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,370
Thank you.

306
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,790
By the way, Shuuya-san...

307
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,790
What is it?

308
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,590
Have you thought of your third wish?

309
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,300
I have, but it can wait until the right time.

310
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,010
Okay.
