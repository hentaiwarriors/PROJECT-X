1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,200
l'm Kenta Ochiai.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,900
Distracted by thoughts of girls in bikinis,

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,890
l got tricked into a part-time job at a resort hotel.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,580
lt looks like it might collapse at any minute,

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,540
and it's run by some old loser.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,780
To top it off, l can't even pick up girls, because Suwatee and Shuree came along.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,790
l was attacked by the Amazon Gang and got beat up by a gangster.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,950
lt sucked.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,880
Then l met the adorable Mahoko!

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,050
l can feel waves of love in my heart!

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,230
Just don't let them become tidal waves!

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,170
Hey, everyone, come and get it!

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,590
Everyone who's hip eats hamburgers!

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,990
Kenta, two strawberry and three melon snow cones, please!

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,460
Okay! No problem!

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,590
So that kid is the rich old man's grandkid? Big deal.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,630
Typical Kenta, drooling all over her!

18
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, Mr. President?

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,310
Miss Namiya, come to my office immediately.

20
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,420
Thanks! You really helped out today!

21
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,790
lt's been a long time since l had this much fun!

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,430
ls it okay if l come help tomorrow too?

23
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,930
Of course! l'd love it!

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,030
Okay, Kenta, see you tomorrow!

25
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,080
That Mahoko. She's such a nice girl!

26
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,740
So sweet and cute too!

27
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,150
Don't you think?

28
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,150
Suwatee?

29
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,690
Shuree, what're you doing?!

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,250
You idiot.

31
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,300
You need a cold shower, so you can think about how much you just hurt Suwatee!

32
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,440
<i>An enormous typhoon is steadily growing stronger...</i>

33
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,000
<i>...and is headed toward Hokuoku lsland at 20km per hour.</i>

34
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,080
ls that typhoon headed for us?

35
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,380
Yeah. lt'll be here in four days.

36
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,320
We should get ready for it.

37
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,100
Suwatee, watch your step...

38
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,670
Are you all right, Mr. Sanada?

39
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,670
Seriously, for a moment...

40
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,870
Mr. Sanada, that's...

41
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,450
''Seiichi Sanada - Champion, All Japan Surf Competition''.

42
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,510
Mr. Sanada, were you a surfer?

43
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,320
Yeah, l was.

44
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,530
l thought it was a great way to pick up girls.

45
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,630
That's cool! You shouldn't be embarrassed!

46
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,380
Why?! Why can't l help Kenta and his friends?!

47
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,440
l put everything l have into this hotel.

48
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,780
l also invested considerable money on the beach.

49
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,360
Sanada is the only one who stands in my way.

50
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,190
Helping them and their hotel is betraying me.

51
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,270
You're so narrow-minded!

52
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,870
l'm not a kid anymore! l can do what l want!

53
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,180
Sir, she's at a difficult age.

54
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,280
lt may not be wise to try and control her too much.

55
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,190
Be quiet. This is between my granddaughter and l.

56
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,050
lt's none of your business.

57
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,340
Hey, Suwatee, cheer up!

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,840
They're having a Summer Festival at the temple.

59
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,100
Want to go with me?

60
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,840
She said she's not going, so leave her alone!

61
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,540
Kenta, why don't you and l go together?

62
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,450
Okay.

63
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,780
Let's go!

64
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,960
Tricked you!

65
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,500
ldiot! Now she's really mad!

66
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,570
Seems so...

67
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,560
Ta-da! How do l look?

68
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,860
l'm surprised.

69
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,730
Surprised?!

70
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,040
l asked you how l looked!

71
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,570
Don't you think l look good?

72
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,110
Ah, yeah.

73
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,480
Fine...

74
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,260
You're beautiful! Beautiful!

75
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,190
Jeez...

76
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,990
What?! Shuree took the best and cutest yukata!

77
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,770
That was the one l wanted!

78
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,760
Poor thing, l didn't know that was the one she had her eye on!

79
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,770
She can't wear the same one as Shuree!

80
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,610
Hey, Suwatee, can l come in?

81
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,070
Yes!

82
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,110
l was cleaning out a box, and l found this.

83
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,210
Would you like it?

84
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,410
l think it'll look good on you.

85
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,020
lt's beautiful!

86
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,390
Can l really have it?

87
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,190
lt's just gathering dust. You take it.

88
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,260
Thank you very much!

89
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,270
Clumsy...

90
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,020
Do you want me to buy one for you?

91
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,920
Really?

92
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,860
What do you want from me in return?

93
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,390
Nothing, it's just to be nice.

94
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,430
Just kidding! Sorry.

95
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,030
Yes, l'd love one.

96
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,660
Pick out the one you like.

97
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,790
Let's see...

98
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,540
You didn't have to get the cheapest one.

99
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,280
l wouldn't have minded spending more.

100
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,850
lt's not that. l just liked this one.

101
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,950
Sometimes you can be so cute.

102
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,320
Really. Spare me the sweet talk.

103
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,660
And l still deny anything happening between us!

104
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,330
What are you getting upset about?

105
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,070
l'm not upset!

106
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,050
Suwatee.

107
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,130
Don't blow it this time, lover boy!

108
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,960
Hey, Suwatee...

109
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,880
Can l buy you some takoyaki? Or maybe some cotton candy?

110
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,720
l'd like a snow cone.

111
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,370
They're such a pain in the ass.

112
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,850
That old guy was the All-Japan Surfing Champion?

113
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,810
l thought he was just some loser.

114
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,590
l was surprised, too.

115
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,960
Good! Those two are getting along well.

116
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,670
All it needs to be perfect is a little music.

117
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,930
Well then, how about we help them out?

118
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,600
Here goes!

119
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,940
Here goes!

120
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,210
What?

121
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,080
l'm hoping you've finally cheered up.

122
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,280
Kenta,

123
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,690
do you think of me as a little girl?

124
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,320
lt's okay to be honest.

125
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,300
l know l'm childish sometimes,

126
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,500
but l'm ready to grow up.

127
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,470
Don't rush things, Suwatee.

128
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,120
We're all overwhelmed by our feelings sometimes,

129
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,450
but basically life is pretty simple.

130
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,890
When you're unsure,

131
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,390
you can always find the truth in your own heart.

132
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,880
Kenta...

133
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,930
And so that's that.

134
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,960
Now how about we get it on?!

135
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,300
You totally ruined the mood!

136
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,400
He's sure no Prince Charming.

137
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,250
Hey, Kenta!

138
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,680
M-Miyuki?

139
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,380
l hear you're chasing little Miss Mahoko.

140
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,190
l knew you were dumb,

141
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,790
but that's really stupid even for you!

142
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,520
Uh, no!

143
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,890
lt's nothing like that!

144
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,300
She was really upset about her grandfather.

145
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,260
That's the problem!

146
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,810
He's really pissed that Mahoko is working at your hotel.

147
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,940
They got into a huge fight over it.

148
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,790
Remember, he's really protective of Mahoko.

149
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,980
That's right!

150
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,150
Mahoko.

151
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,230
Hey, Shuree? Are you still awake?

152
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,580
Maybe Kenta and l aren't meant to be.

153
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:14,810
He's always got some other girl and doesn't even notice me.

154
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,490
Maybe the gods are telling me to just give up.

155
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,360
Hey, Little Miss l-Used-To-Be-A-Goddess, what are you saying?

156
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,630
You can't really believe that.

157
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,830
But...

158
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,030
So, you'll just give up?

159
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,800
Forget him just like that?

160
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,710
lf not, you'll just have to try harder.

161
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,910
Shuree, why is it so important for you to get us together?

162
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,490
Shuree, you aren't...

163
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,820
For the last time, l am not interested!

164
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,530
He's not my type at all!

165
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,830
Now, let's go to sleep! Good night, Suwatee!

166
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,070
Good night, Shuree.

167
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,360
Another long day at work...

168
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,890
Do you have a boyfriend?

169
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,390
l hope not. You're so cute!

170
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,900
What's with them? Those guys are all over her!

171
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,690
Why don't you come out with us?

172
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,500
Hey, guys!

173
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,370
We're free tonight. Pick us up later.

174
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,140
Score! Yeah, okay!

175
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,280
Shuree, what are you doing?

176
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,340
lt's brilliant!

177
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,780
Make Kenta jealous by going out with another guy!

178
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,390
Pick us up here at seven, okay? Don't forget!

179
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:58,860
Okay! Pick us up here at seven, okay? Don't forget!

180
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,350
Okay!

181
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,830
Hey, Suwatee, what do you think of this outfit?

182
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,040
Jeez...

183
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,510
Quit worrying!

184
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,650
Right now he's so worried about you, that he can't think straight.

185
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,710
Sorry!

186
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,320
lt'll be okay!

187
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,130
You guys ready for the next outfit?

188
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,460
Hey! This isn't a fashion show!

189
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,070
Kenta...

190
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,840
Suwatee.

191
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,080
You're going dancing with Shuree, right?

192
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,150
Have fun!

193
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,490
But, l really...

194
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:37,190
Hey!

195
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,590
Hey! Suwatee, hurry up! Let's go!

196
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,730
Suwatee, hurry up! Let's go!

197
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,060
Suwatee! Suwatee, hurry up! Let's go!

198
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,220
Suwatee, hurry up! Let's go!

199
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,820
Hey!

200
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,200
Suwatee!

201
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,240
Suwatee, what are you doing?

202
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,470
Hurry up! Suwatee, what are you doing?

203
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,600
Hurry up!

204
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,610
Grandpa, how could you transfer me to a different school without even asking me?!

205
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,550
Seika Girls Academy is very strict.

206
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,110
lt's perfect for you!

207
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,160
l won't go!

208
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,990
That girls school... l'd rather be here, at the beach!

209
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,060
Mahoko!

210
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,340
Miss!

211
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,440
Sir, that was too much!

212
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,200
Damn it! What have l done?

213
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,060
lt's them. lt's their fault that Mahoko...

214
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,500
l'll make them pay for this!

215
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,260
l hate eating dinner all by myself.

216
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,270
Mahoko?

217
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,400
Kenta!

218
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,440
Hey, what's wrong?

219
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,860
So, your grandfather really did that?

220
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,220
l understand his feelings.

221
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,530
My parents died when l was four.

222
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,730
l'm the only family he has.

223
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,510
lt's not that l'm not interested in our hotel.

224
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:49,710
l just don't think we have to destroy everyone else!

225
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,560
And...

226
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,190
Mahoko...

227
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,660
lt'll be okay! Just try talking to him.

228
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,730
But he treats me like a baby!

229
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,770
There's no helping that... you are still a child.

230
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,040
You too, Kenta?!

231
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,040
You're awful!

232
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,910
Sorry.

233
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,740
Mahoko...

234
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,050
Kenta...

235
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,420
l'm not a child anymore.

236
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,940
l... lt's my first time.

237
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,480
Don't! lt feels strange.

238
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,790
No, don't stare at me!

239
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,120
lt's beautiful, Mahoko.

240
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,530
Oh, no!

241
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,680
No! No, l...

242
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,650
Mahoko...

243
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,160
Kenta...

244
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,450
Please be gentle!

245
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,370
Mahoko, you're so hot.

246
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,470
No, l'm so embarrassed!

247
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,400
You're such a drag!

248
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,530
There's nothing as depressing as a woman in love.

249
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,000
You're worried about Kenta, right?

250
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,000
l'll stay here with the guys. Go on home.

251
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,600
Shuree...

252
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,370
Thank you!

253
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:49,590
l can't argue with a woman in love.

254
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,140
Mina...

255
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,770
What was that about?

256
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,710
l'll walk you home.

257
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,360
Cheer up! l'll help you talk to your grandfather.

258
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,170
What is this?

259
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,920
Grandpa!

260
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,300
That guy's your grandfather?

261
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,660
Kenta!

262
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,840

263
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,450
Hey, what's going on?!

264
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,680
