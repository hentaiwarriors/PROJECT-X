1
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,030
As the years advance,
my hearing declines.

2
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,980
My legs are not
what they used to be.

3
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,110
I can't stop getting uglier.

4
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:03,150
The women I loved are getting
grey hair and wrinkles.

5
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,420
All this irritates me constantly.

6
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,560
If I go on living in this world...

7
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,800
I don't think things
will get any better.

8
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,450
Let's go!

18
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,650
Hey, I'll go in for a bit.

19
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,650
I'll wait.

20
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,390
Ah, Juzo the Tailor!

21
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,160
Yes, that's me.

22
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,660
So, is the master in?

23
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,960
He is.

24
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,270
I'm leaving for Edo,
so I came to greet him.

25
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,750
Hey, go and ask
the Master, if...

26
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,270
Yes!

27
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,260
Please don't bother him.
Would you just tell him so?

28
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,220
I'll be back soon.

29
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,490
Juzo?

30
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,620
Yonosuke
(aged 54)

31
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,400
Manager!

32
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:51,900
Yes.

33
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,170
Manager?

34
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:54,930
Yes!

35
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,440
Give him some money.

36
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,510
Yes, sir.

37
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,290
Master, I didn't come for that.

38
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,380
I know. I just want to help.

39
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,650
Take this.

40
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,390
Thank you very much.

41
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,660
What brings you to Edo?

42
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm going to sleep
with Komurasaki...

43
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,000
...the most renowned
courtesan.

44
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,910
Huh?
What?

45
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,040
I was drunk at a party...

46
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,920
I said I'd sleep with Komurasaki
at our first meeting.

47
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,990
Then the party host made me a bet.

48
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,290
At your first meeting?

49
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,590
Umm, yeah...

50
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,860
Uhei the Clown is with
me to watch the results.

51
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,380
Tell me, Juzo...

52
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,370
Yes.

53
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,010
What did you bet?

54
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,610
If I succeed, I'll get
one of the villas.

55
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,050
And if not?

56
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,360
Well...

57
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,650
What then?

58
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,030
Listen, Juzo!

59
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,390
Yes.

60
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,730
Those courtesans are special.

61
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,170
Once, they were only
for feudal lords...

62
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,940
They are well taught
and very proud.

63
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,310
They are versed in the arts,
very sophisticated.

64
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,980
Since recently, the also
receive us merchants...

65
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,920
...but certainly not into
their beds, right away!

66
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,430
No bed at the first meeting?!

67
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,430
No workers accepted.

68
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,770
Sorry to say, but you
can't even meet her!

69
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:10,070
He knew that and forced
me to bet my manhood!

70
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,940
Who is this malicious man?

71
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,750
He made me promise
not to tell his name.

72
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,190
What a shame!

73
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,750
Manager!

74
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,750
Manager, I'll accompany
him to Edo.

75
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,160
What?!

76
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,490
What?

77
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,070
His father had a silver mine.

78
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,910
He came to Kyoto
with a big fortune...

79
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,550
He liked wine
and women.

80
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,950
His name was
Mr. Dream.

81
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,390
He redeemed the courtesan
who gave him a son, Yonosuke.

82
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,290
Like his father, Yonosuke
was precocious...

83
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,740
At the age of seven he got laid...

84
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:34,680
At the age of nine, he started
learning business at a relative's...

85
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,210
He also learned homosexuality.

86
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,150
At the age of eleven,
he bought his first whores.

87
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,720
No night was spent alone, then.

88
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,760
Neighborhood girls, wives, whores...

89
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,560
As long as she was
a woman, he didn't care.

90
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,910
I came with you...

91
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,850
...because I pitied you probably
losing your manhood.

92
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,730
I thought I'd arrange that
you can see her, at least.

93
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,470
It sure won't be easy.

94
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,030
Even if you get
a chance and fail...

95
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,410
Accept your fate.

96
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,180
You know...

97
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,570
Y-yes.

98
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,080
Don't talk like that.

99
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,380
Behave like a rich merchant
in front of the others.

100
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,290
Yes.

101
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,860
This is the landmark tree.

102
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,620
The red light district
is over there.

103
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,290
So this is the famous gate to
Yoshiwara, the red light district.

104
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:18,090
Ordinary whores are
in every brothel here.

105
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,730
...but courtesans must be
called to a tea house.

106
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,830
Well, let's go!

107
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,950
Hey, wait for me!

108
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,050
You want Komurasaki?

109
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,220
Yes.

110
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,990
This gentleman has come
to Edo for the first time.

111
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,700
He wants her at any
cost to remember Edo.

112
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,790
We'll gladly be at your service.

113
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,970
However, Komurasaki
is so popular...

114
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:13,270
I'm afraid you'll have to
wait for four or five days.

115
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,870
We know that, right?

116
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,180
Y-yes!

117
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,940
At the age of 1 8, Yonosuke
was sent to the Edo branch

118
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,450
On his way, he bought a whore
at every post town.

119
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,650
He took a long time.

120
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,420
In Edo, he promptly
tried out all the brothels.

121
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,690
He went with boys and girls....

122
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:16,500
...and ended up staying weeks
at Yoshiwara.

123
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,770
Even his father disowned him.

124
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,880
So, he became a monk.

125
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,340
Be he wasn't religious
even for a week.

126
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,640
Lust overcame him.

127
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,820
He called peddlers and the like
into his temple day and night...

128
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,330
Gentlemen, the courtesan is
on the way here.

129
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,460
It won't be long now!

130
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,200
Thank you.

131
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,740
Welcome.

132
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,830
Yuzo, are you ready?

133
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,440
Yes.

134
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,770
I'm ready.

135
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,180
Not that. I mean the shroud
for your thing.

136
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,650
Are you wearing the red loin cloth
and rosary I gave you?

137
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,310
Yes.

138
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,250
Show me!

139
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,720
Here?

140
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,190
Yeah, go ahead!

141
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,790
Here, sir?

142
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,520
Great!

143
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,330
I'm leaving.

144
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,330
But Sir...

145
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,910
Brace up.
You're the customer.

146
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,800
At the age of 20, still disowned,
he went to Osaka...

147
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,780
...Ieading a poor laborer's life.

148
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,850
Lust didn't leave him alone
all this time.

149
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,590
He then started 15 years
of roaming.

150
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,260
At the age of 22, he was
peddling fish...

151
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,030
Whenever he wasn't
frequenting brothels.

152
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,360
At the age of 25, he worked
in a gold mine.

153
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,310
But his dream of making a fortune
didn't come true.

154
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,180
He roamed through Northern Japan,
making love to all kinds of women.

155
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,550
At the age of 27, he forced
himself on a shrine maiden.

156
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:14,890
As a penalty, half of his hair was shaven
off and he was thrown into jail.

157
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:24,800
He was released on amnesty
after a year.

158
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,140
Wow! This is real happiness!

159
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,170
You two are very beautiful.

160
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,080
Why is the courtesan so late?

161
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,800
What?

162
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,790
You mean me?!

163
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,470
All right! All right!

164
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,780
I'm afraid he is drunk.

165
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,740
Did you like that?

166
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,040
I'm generous!

167
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,410
My money!

168
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,520
Hehehe...

169
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,090
Oh, my!

170
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,200
Ahahaha!

171
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,300
I won't mind.

172
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,950
Gentlemen!

173
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,880
The courtesan is here!

174
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,780
Well, have a drink?

175
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,920
Whisper...

176
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,060
She won't accept his cup
at the first meeting.

177
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,330
Go ahead, take this!

178
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,820
Huh! Oh!

179
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,090
I'll pour you some.

180
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,620
Oh my god!

181
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,230
Please do relax.

182
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,740
Would you continue while
I go and change my clothes?

183
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:13,770
At the age of 33, his father
died, forgiving him.

184
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,470
He was left with
a huge legacy.

185
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,940
His mother let him be.

186
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:29,100
He then, as it were, conquered
the red light districts of Japan.

187
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,330
He slept with every
famous courtesan...

188
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,830
...attaining the very zenith
of sensuality.

189
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,540
Since the age of seven until that of sixty
he knew as many as 3742 women.

190
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:52,310
Also the men he touched add
up to as many as 725.

191
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,310
He is sophisticated now.

192
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,650
Yonosuke leaves no posterity.

193
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:08,230
He frittered away his fortune
on sensuality with women and men.

194
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:16,200
What?! You had another
identical kimono!

195
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:22,030
What consideration!
What preparedness!

196
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,330
Sir!

197
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,510
Would you follow me?

198
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,220
This way.

199
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,230
Uhhh... Where
are we going?

200
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,220
Well, then.

201
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,420
Ummm... Well...

202
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,820
Well, then!

203
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,230
Huh? No! Wait a second!
Hold on!

204
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:27,600
I didn't... I didn't do
that intentionally.

205
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,410
You don't have to apologize.
Why don't you come closer?

206
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,890
Thanks.

207
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,160
Thanks a lot.

208
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,890
Funny guy!
Weird guy!

209
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,050
Come closer.

210
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,880
Fashion Shop "Dream"
Edo Branch

211
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,810
Here!

212
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,030
So, the courtesan wrote this
on your loin-cloth.

213
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,370
Yes, as proof!

214
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,540
"Hereby, I admit that I slept with
Juzo. Signed Komurasaki"

215
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,880
Did you witness that?

216
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:41,580
Yes, sir.

217
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,380
Are you sure?

218
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,320
Yes, sir.

219
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:50,320
Both my honor and manhood
have been saved.

220
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,560
Thank you, sir.

221
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,500
I'm impressed...

222
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,800
Thank you very much.

223
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,110
Look, Komurasaki...

224
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:16,680
Yes?

225
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:27,160
You agreed to sleep with me only
at our third meeting.

226
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,800
Why did you favor Juzo?

227
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:35,830
He seemed simple enough to
accept a foolish bet.

228
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,610
I hated the one who put him on.

229
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,810
That's why I gave him
a special favor.

230
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:54,890
You were right. I also helped him
out of spite for the one.

231
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,360
You have sharp eyes,
Komurasaki.

232
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,960
You're beautiful, smart
and spirited.

233
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,800
You're the best of all,
I think I'm in...!

234
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,670
Love me now,
Yonosuke!

235
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,010
Komurasaki!

236
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,420
Komurasaki!

237
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,640
You want more?

238
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:16,880
Yes!

239
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,450
Me too!

240
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:24,420
Even if we end up in hell,
we'll be together forever!

241
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:27,620
Yes!

242
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,730
Yonusuke...

243
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,910
Sorry.

244
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,120
As the years advance,
my hearing declines.

245
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,820
I can't stop getting uglier.

246
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,260
The women I loved are getting
grey hair and wrinkles.

247
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,500
All this irritates me constantly.

248
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,030
If I go on living in this world...

249
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,540
I don't think things
will get any better.

250
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,460
The boat is ready, sir!

251
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,530
Good.

252
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:06,360
Let's have fun all the way.
There may be no returning.

253
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:11,130
Where are we going?

254
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,090
We'll go find
a women's island.

255
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:21,330
You shall have all the women
you like there.

256
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:27,000
Fine! I won't mind dying there,
after using up my juices!

257
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:33,210
That will be real pleasure
for a man!

258
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,890
Let's follow the master!
