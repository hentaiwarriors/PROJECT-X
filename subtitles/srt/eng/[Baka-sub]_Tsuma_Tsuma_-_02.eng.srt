1
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,550
We're here earlier than expected.

2
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,950
Yusuke-kun.

3
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,320
Yeah.

4
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,260
Um, sorry, but don't talk to me until we stop.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,990
Note: The symbol on the rear windscreen represents a driver who just acquired the license.

6
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,230
Oh, Yusuke-kun!

7
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,240
Too far. Stop, stop!

8
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,010
Phew, we're finally here...

9
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,080
Yusuke-kun, good job. You're sweating.

10
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,650
Thanks.

11
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,930
Orisaku-san and I...

12
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,210
I meant Akira and I are newlyweds as of today.

13
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,320
We had many obstacles, but we're finally starting a new and exciting life.

14
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,680
It's like a dream!

15
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,490
This is our treasure.

16
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,230
Yeah.

17
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,330
But, you are my most valuable treasure now.

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,670
Yusuke-kun...

19
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,640
Tonight, would you like to take a bath first?

20
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,740
Dinner?

21
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,810
Or... me?

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,360
Yes, this is our first night together!

23
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,330
Waiting in bed feels awkward.

24
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,210
Feeling a bit shy...

25
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,470
Soon... I am nervous!

26
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,880
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,180
There was a lot of work so I couldn't wash your back.

28
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,280
Don't worry about it.

29
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,550
We're going to spend the rest of our lives together.

30
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,720
<i>I wanted to...</i>

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,290
You're right, good job today.

32
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,930
Uh, well... you too...

33
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,730
<i>She must be tired.</i>

34
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,260
<i>I was hoping we would... but can't blame her.</i>

35
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Yusuke-kun, are you already sleeping?

36
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,640
Yes! I, I meant no, I'm awake.

37
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,510
I'm tired, but also very nervous and...

38
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,020
Well, I'm finally your wife.

39
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,680
And when I think you're finally my husband, my sleepiness went away.

40
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,920
You too, Orisaku-san?

41
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,020
Hey, you called me Orisaku-san!

42
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,750
I'm now Oshima Akira so call me Akira.

43
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,160
You're right, I'm sorry.

44
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,000
Um... Akira.

45
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,690
Yes!

46
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,470
Akira...

47
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,080
Yusuke-kun...

48
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,220
Yusuke-kun...

49
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,800
Akira!

50
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,260
It's OK...

51
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,460
<i>We're grownups... it's fine, right?</i>

52
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,130
<i>So this is Akira's...</i>

53
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,460
It hurts!

54
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,630
I, I'm sorry!

55
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,370
This time, gently...

56
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,350
I'm sorry I laughed.

57
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,910
I'll hold it in, so continue...

58
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,220
We were waiting for this day...

59
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,120
So please...

60
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,180
Yeah.

61
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,000
I can't... hold it!

62
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,490
Akira...

63
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,160
No...!

64
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,360
Don't stare at it.

65
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,970
<i>So cute...</i>

66
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,770
I'm going to stick it in... OK?

67
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,250
Huh?

68
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,520
Yusuke-kun... we have to make yours wet too...

69
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,020
I feel it!

70
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,480
...Why?

71
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,950
<i>It's starting to feel good...</i>

72
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,540
Sorry...

73
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,910
No, you were tired, Yusuke-kun.

74
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,920
Don't worry, there's always tomorrow...

75
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,650
If not, there's always the day after so don't worry.

76
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,920
<i>Day after tomorrow...</i>

77
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,490
Cheer up Yusuke-kun, fight!

78
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,500
Honey...

79
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,080
Wake up.

80
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,850
You're finally awake.

81
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,450
Good morning.

82
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,960
Good morning, Yusuke-kun.

83
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,460
Breakfast is ready, let's eat together.

84
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,690
You have to go to the studio today, right?

85
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,290
That's right, I can't be late!

86
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,630
I better dress.

87
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,500
This came out of the boxes, but who is she?

88
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,740
She's an old friend of mine who is a few years younger than me.

89
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,180
She was very sick and had to move to America for treatment.

90
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,420
Of course, I haven't seen her ever since.

91
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,850
I kept this picture as a memento.

92
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,130
I see, well I'm not worried...

93
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,860
Oh, are you jealous?

94
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,400
That's not it! And hurry up.

95
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,180
<i>Yusuke-kun, we're going to get married one day.

96
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,140
<i>Alright, Akko, I promise.</i>

97
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,950
I'm going to work.

98
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,750
Take care.

99
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,450
Yusuke-kun, lets do our best tonight.

100
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,420
Don't mind!

101
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,240
I'll do my best!

102
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,410
I am a housewife as of today.

103
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,010
Fight!

104
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,460
My dreams have come true, going to work on a movie!

105
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,070
Oi, Yusuke!

106
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,870
You must be happy!

107
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,180
<i>This person saw my 8mm movie and liked my work.</i>

108
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,620
<i>He even offered me a job here. He is the Vice President, Fujimiya Shizuma-san.</i>

109
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,590
Go easy, Shizuma-san.

110
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,590
Hey, I'm not going to go easy on you.

111
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,960
By the way, how is that white house?

112
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,570
It's good, thank you for letting us know about it.

113
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,700
Well, how is your sex life with Akira?

114
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,540
Well...

115
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,350
What to cook tonight?

116
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,550
Maybe something with meat?

117
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,550
Ma'am, today we have a big sale on steak.

118
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,820
Ma'am...?

119
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,020
Aren't you? I mean that ring...

120
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,860
Oh...

121
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,960
I'm sorry if I'm wrong.

122
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,700
But I usually get housewives here so I sense these things.

123
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,140
Um, well...

124
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,680
I knew it, movie directors are so demanding.

125
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,770
If I don't bring the actress, I'll get yelled at.

126
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,050
Misaki-san.

127
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,450
Please hurry to the studi...!

128
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,460
I'm sorry!

129
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,300
You must be new here.

130
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,870
You're lucky to see the naked body of an actress.

131
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,820
No...

132
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
I, I'm sorry.

133
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,950
You see!

134
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,790
You're still looking!

135
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,420
Uh, well...

136
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,550
We're going to start now, so please hurry!

137
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,200
That was close.

138
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,630
Better be more careful...

139
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,500
But, she had a great body...

140
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,770
Hey, I have a favor to ask you.

141
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,580
See you guys later, I gotta go.

142
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,490
I'm here.

143
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,430
Misaki-san, what is it?

144
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,020
Bringing me here all of a sudden?

145
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,490
How much do you know about me?

146
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,430
Huh?

147
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,300
<i>What the...?!</i>

148
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,990
You're Yusuke-kun, right?

149
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,870
What does she want...

150
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,270
I better hurry home to Akira.

151
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,310
I'm home!

152
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,020
Welcome back, Honey.

153
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,710
Would you like to have dinner first?

154
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,150
Take a bath?

155
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,320
Or me?

156
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,790
Orisaku... no, Akira!

157
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,360
I did my best coordinating for you.

158
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,270
So, what would you like to have first?

159
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,100
It's obvious!

160
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,910
Not here...

161
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,040
Don't mind!

162
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,120
Here comes Yusuke!

163
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,720
Yusuke-kun!

164
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,640
Let's try again tomorrow.

165
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,260
What is it?

166
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,800
What!?

167
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,900
Good morning, Assistant Director.

168
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,700
Why are you here, Misaki-san?

169
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,700
Is it me?

170
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,780
Wow, you're friends with the actress Misaki Atsuko-san?

171
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,480
But why are you here?

172
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,820
I thought you're going to help
her practice for the part, Yusuke-kun?

173
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,020
What?

174
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,720
Yusuke-kun, that's great! I'll cheer you on.

175
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,060
I'm counting on you, Director.

176
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,930
That's assistant director, besides what about today's shooting?

177
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,590
You didn't hear?

178
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,540
The director cancelled today's shoot.

179
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,300
What, really?

180
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,970
Sorry, but looks like the paparazzi got a picture of us yesterday.

181
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,910
I wanted to apologize to you and asked them to cancel today.

182
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,250
What?!

183
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,780
Well, I have some errands to run, so see you guys later.

184
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,050
Sorry about that.

185
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,400
I can't bother you.

186
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,190
This is the first step in your career.

187
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,260
I can't get in the way.

188
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,330
What do you...?

189
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,840
What!? This is...

190
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,680
This is the sacred grounds of husbands and wives.

191
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,420
So it has a meaning to me...

192
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,630
Stop it!

193
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,230
What are you thinking!?

194
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,070
I am an assistant director and just got married with Akira.

195
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:08,050
There may be some unspoken rules in this industry, but please don't drag me into it!

196
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,020
Besides, I thought you came here to apologize...?

197
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,900
Aren't you a man?

198
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,130
Show me what you got.

199
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,170
No, not right away...

200
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,900
Isn't this what you wanted!?

201
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,770
You're...

202
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,910
Please, continue...

203
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,480
OK...

204
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,910
Going to cum...

205
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,380
So am I!

206
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,220
Going to cum!

207
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,360
Akira!

208
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,510
So it was your first time... Atsuko-san.

209
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,480
I'm sorry, it's been a while I had some so I came inside...

210
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,680
What are you talking about, you do that with your wife all the time.

211
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,090
If you get pregnant, I can't take responsibility.

212
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,690
Since you seduced me.

213
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,890
You're so cold now.

214
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,730
Hey, do you...

215
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,890
Yeah?

216
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,470
No, it's nothing.

217
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,770
I'll be going.

218
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,870
I'm sorry to dirty your sheets.

219
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:51,870
Oh...

220
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,470
Let me use the shower.

221
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,780
<i>I don't feel right staying at home.</i>

222
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,790
<i>But there's nothing at the studio...</i>

223
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,320
<i>There's nothing to do...</i>

224
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,290
Um, excuse me.

225
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,200
Yes, who is it?

226
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,530
I'm a reporter from a station.

227
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,370
I have some questions about Misaki Atsuko's relationships...

228
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,570
I'm new here so I don't know anything!

229
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,630
See you!

230
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,980
<i>Sigh, there's nowhere else to go but stay at home...</i>

231
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,540
I'm home...

232
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,060
What happened!?

233
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,120
Yusuke-kun...

234
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,700
I slipped while cleaning.

235
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,630
Are you alright, are you hurt?

236
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,980
Be careful, I don't want you to get hurt.

237
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,840
Yusuke-kun...

238
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,570
Akira...

239
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,220
Akira!

240
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,390
Your clothes will get wet!

241
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,450
Akira...

242
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,160
Yusuke-kun.

243
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,060
Fine then.

244
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,550
<i>The fire within me ignites like never before.</i>

245
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,790
<i>I can't control the beast within me...</i>

246
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,960
Yusuke-kun...

247
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,560
Amazing, I feel strange, Yusuke-kun.

248
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,160
Me too.

249
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,880
Great, I'm going to cum...

250
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,580
But this time, I'll cum inside...

251
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,280
A lot.

252
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,220
But we have to plan these things...

253
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,890
We can overcome everything with love.

254
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,200
<i>Yes, our love...</i>

255
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,300
Don't be afraid, relax.

256
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,780
OK...

257
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,370
Here I go, stay still.

258
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,520
It's inside, Akira. It's inside!

259
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,380
Yusuke-kun!

260
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,150
It's wet and warm, feels good.

261
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,890
I'm going to move.

262
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,500
Akira, I love you. I love...

263
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,270
Me too, I love you, Yusuke-kun...

264
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,360
Feels good!

265
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,580
Yusuke-kun, it's hitting deep... deep inside!

266
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,010
Akira, you're so tight!

267
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,080
I'm glad you're mine, it's like a dream having sex with you everyday!

268
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,680
Me too... I'm glad that I'm yours!

269
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,970
I'm going to cum, inside!

270
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,740
Give me, give me your little babies!

271
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,350
<i>I have to thank Atsuko...

272
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,660
Good morning, Assistant Director.

273
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,660
Good morning, Atsuko-san.

274
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,660
There was one thing I wasn't pleased about with our practice.

275
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,600
Wasn't pleased?

276
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,170
Help me again.

277
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,140
I can't.

278
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,410
But I do have to thank you for making things smooth.

279
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,650
Anyway, you better keep your promise.

280
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,980
Promise?

281
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,890
As promised, I will marry you one day.

282
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,090
I will take you away from your wife.

283
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,140
Let me know when you're ready.

284
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,610
Akko?

285
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,410
Can't be...

286
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,510
<i>I'm not giving up...</i>

287
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,080
Akira, I'm home.

288
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,780
Would you like to have dinner?

289
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,520
A bath?

290
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,030
Or me?

291
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,870
You of course!

292
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,100
Good!

293
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,600
Yusuke-kun.

294
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,120
Yusuke-kun!

295
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,620
Akira!

296
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,400
Yusuke-kun!

297
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,230
<i>I can't betray Akira.</i>

298
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,570
<i>I love her deeply.</i>
