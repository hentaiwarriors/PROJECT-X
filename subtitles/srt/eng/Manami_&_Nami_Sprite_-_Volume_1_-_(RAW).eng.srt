1
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:34,978
Somebody...

2
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:38,344
It hurts...

3
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:42,914
It feels just as if...

4
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,120
somebody's inside my head.

5
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,353
Let me out.

6
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,261
Let me out, it's saying.

7
00:00:55,936 --> 00:01:02,273
Manami and Nami
Sprite

8
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,718
It's sweltering!

9
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:19,918
A guy like me from the
boondocks in the north...

10
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:21,859
can't put up with this heat!

11
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:25,388
I'm sure it's around here.

12
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:29,365
Oh, there it is.

13
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:40,407
My name's Toru Takamura.

14
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:43,679
My mom's in the hospital
for an extended stay...

15
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:47,187
so I ended up coming to
stay with relatives in Tokyo.

16
00:01:47,254 --> 00:01:48,551
Unreal, huh?

17
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:52,581
But I think I might even
be a bit excited about it.

18
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:54,016
Huh?

19
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,629
Oh, it looks like nobody's home.

20
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,563
Maybe I should've called
from the station.

21
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:08,265
Let's see...

22
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:13,702
Huh?

23
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,149
What?

24
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:34,466
Oh! Gee whiz!

25
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:43,632
Huh?

26
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,239
Um... er...

27
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:49,146
Boy, it sure is hot out!

28
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:00,723
Hey, look! I'm not
a pervert or anything!

29
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:03,862
Mom! Mom!
There's a weirdo here!

30
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:05,899
Somebody help me!!

31
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:07,600
I'm Toru Taka...

32
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,769
Honestly, Toru!

33
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:17,538
I would've picked you up
at the station if you'd called.

34
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:20,239
I'm sorry, I've been
a real pain.

35
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:22,475
Well, it sounds like you've
got your troubles.

36
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,449
Your mom's all right?

37
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:28,284
Yeah, she had her operation,
so she's feeling better.

38
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:33,287
Manami went upstairs
without even apologizing.

39
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:36,458
I don't mind her being quiet.

40
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:38,662
But she's a poor talker,
and timid.

41
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,997
Well, it's my fault for letting
myself into the yard.

42
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:49,433
Manami, I explained to you that
Toru would be coming, right?

43
00:03:50,344 --> 00:03:51,333
Yeah.

44
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:53,407
Um... Toru...

45
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:56,780
Sorry I was so rude to
you earlier!

46
00:03:57,217 --> 00:03:58,912
No problem.

47
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:02,312
You couldn't help mistake
me for a weirdo.

48
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:05,222
It's partly my fault, too, for
letting myself into the yard.

49
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:11,598
Manami, I'm going to make
dinner, so help me out, okay?

50
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:12,859
Sure thing!

51
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,720
Man, I was blown away to see
what a babe Manami'd become.

52
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:43,888
Look, Toru.

53
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:47,024
I'll squeeze you between these!

54
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:49,933
Look...

55
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:53,535
Look...

56
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:12,522
It hurts...

57
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:14,254
My head hurts...

58
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:44,881
What's wrong?

59
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,186
Don't like your uniform?

60
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,922
My last uniform had
a standup collar.

61
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:50,861
So this one's kind of drafty.

62
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:58,767
Man, college uniforms in
Tokyo sure have short skirts.

63
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,472
Summer time; a short skirt
blows in the breeze

64
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,109
Morning!

65
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:13,085
Hey, Chiaki.

66
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:14,620
Come here a sec.

67
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:18,317
That Manami chick has come
to college with a stranger!

68
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:24,257
Ooh, he's kinda cute.

69
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:28,092
But what's Manami doing
stuck to him like that?

70
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:29,897
I don't like the looks of this.

71
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,130
No kidding!

72
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:33,070
Things would've gone
so well with Masaya...

73
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,539
if it hadn't been for Manami!

74
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:35,267
What?

75
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:39,278
Was Chiaki jilted because
of Manami?

76
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:43,677
Probably because Manami
put on a real cutesy act.

77
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:47,276
Which isn't to say that
you're not cute, Chiaki.

78
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:48,548
Exactly!

79
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,624
Manami's not just cute,
she's got a great figure.

80
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:54,592
Uh-huh.

81
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:58,961
When we got changed in gym
she had quite the body!

82
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:00,693
Cheeky broad!

83
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:03,462
So that's how she
seduced Masaya!

84
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:05,368
That's disgusting!

85
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:08,268
I can't take it!

86
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:11,174
Um... Chiaki?

87
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:12,767
Cute or not...

88
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:15,940
you're wrong if you think
I'll let you get away with this!

89
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:26,048
I'll have to teach you a lesson;
that's all there is to it!

90
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:28,752
- Right!
- Yeah, good idea.

91
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:33,756
Women are such loose-lipped
beavers.

92
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,234
You're mixing your
metaphors, there.

93
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:50,650
Well?

94
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:52,582
How's your first day here going?

95
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:55,912
Well, let's see...

96
00:07:56,857 --> 00:08:01,556
It's a typical city college with
lots of cute babes, so it's fun!

97
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,361
Huh?

98
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,600
I didn't think I'd run into
you at lunch, Manami...

99
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,604
and here, you were eating
with this guy.

100
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:14,774
Sorry, were you looking for me?

101
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:19,577
Oh, she's gone out of her
way to hang out with me.

102
00:08:20,547 --> 00:08:22,947
Watch out, or you'll make
Masaya jealous!

103
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:25,849
No, wait!

104
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,910
He's my relative's son.

105
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:30,355
Give Masaya an excuse, too.

106
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:31,254
Come on...

107
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:32,019
Bye!

108
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:33,059
See ya later!

109
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:38,921
Uh, so is Masaya your
boyfriend, then?

110
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,103
No, it's really not like that.

111
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:46,104
I wonder about that.

112
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:50,234
But I'm not really in a position
to be making any judgments.

113
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:56,482
Physical Education
So, women have their
periods every month.

114
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,018
And I'm not talking about
punctuation, here.

115
00:08:59,086 --> 00:08:59,950
You listening?

116
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:16,365
Hey, I'm on to you, Manami.

117
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:20,497
You've spent the whole day
with a new transfer student?

118
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:23,906
You're gonna make me jealous.

119
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:25,877
It's not what it sounds like...

120
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:29,443
Yo, Masaya!

121
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:32,576
Better hurry to our club
or we'll be crushed again!

122
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:33,880
Right!

123
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:36,855
Wait for me in the cafeteria
till my club's over.

124
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:38,413
Uh-huh...

125
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:43,693
See ya!

126
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:09,451
Geez, sure is tough transferring
part way through college!

127
00:10:16,797 --> 00:10:18,697
Hurry and get over here!

128
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:20,426
Why don't you say something?

129
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,765
Just what I didn't need...
a cat fight.

130
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:27,898
Manami, didn't you know Chiaki
was going out with Masaya?

131
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:32,408
You went and seduced him,
and they'd been getting along!

132
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:33,535
No way!

133
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,106
Man, just because you're
not bad looking!

134
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:38,413
Then today, a transfer
student's after you.

135
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:39,850
You're unreal!

136
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,146
That's right!

137
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:42,483
Y-You're wrong!

138
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,319
He's just my...

139
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,390
What're we wrong about?

140
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:49,361
How about explaining yourself?

141
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:51,659
Oh, boy. This is trouble!

142
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:53,656
Hey! What're you're doing?

143
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,860
- Leave her alone!
- Huh?

144
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:16,180
What a lame ass!

145
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:18,690
Better rescue yourself first!

146
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:21,587
Aha! He's that transfer student!

147
00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:22,656
Toru!

148
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:25,028
Toru! Are you okay?

149
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,968
You slag!

150
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,305
That's how you trapped Masaya!

151
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:39,607
No, I didn't trap him!

152
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:43,310
He's the one who started
talking to me.

153
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,044
If you weren't around, I'd
be with him right now!

154
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:53,618
Tell me the truth!

155
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,718
You did it with Masaya here,
didn't you?

156
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:56,489
No!

157
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:59,360
You won't need those when
you meet with him today, right?

158
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,367
Hold her arms, Tomoko!

159
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:03,996
NOOO!

160
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:14,446
Ooh, look at those cute pubes!

161
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,243
Maybe I'll do something nasty.

162
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:17,947
No!

163
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:19,713
Somebody help me!

164
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:26,215
It feels like my head's
splitting in two again!

165
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:33,556
Manami...

166
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,323
Manami!

167
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:51,975
Let me go, fool.

168
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:52,711
Huh?

169
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:55,652
I told you, let go!

170
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:05,364
Maybe I'm being too
easy on you...

171
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:07,332
in paying back your tricks.

172
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:11,236
That's the same, quiet Manami?

173
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:13,305
I don't believe it!

174
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:16,803
Now you've gone too far!

175
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:19,242
Quit gawking and help
me out, you two!

176
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:20,568
What?

177
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:29,579
I'll get you!

178
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:39,962
Smash!!

179
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:51,003
Attack!!

180
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:04,217
Yay!

181
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:18,195
Yeah, right.

182
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:43,852
N-No way!

183
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:02,106
What're you gawking at,
bonehead?

184
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:04,472
M-Manami?

185
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:07,682
Don't call me that dumb name.

186
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:11,152
Just call me Nami.

187
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:13,120
Nami?

188
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:28,501
Man, that was quite the
grueling first day, yesterday.

189
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,205
Good morning.

190
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,674
Good morning.

191
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:37,510
Hey, where's your mom
and dad?

192
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:40,644
Dad's golfing, and mom's
at her culture class.

193
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,381
They just left.

194
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:45,552
Well, dig in!

195
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,420
Whoah! Unreal!

196
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:51,060
Yesterday was an incredible
day, huh?

197
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:54,198
Uh... um... Toru?

198
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:55,423
Yeah?

199
00:15:55,902 --> 00:15:58,803
Did I do anything strange
yesterday?

200
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:03,408
D-Don't you remember
what happened?

201
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,974
No...

202
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:09,673
I vaguely remember Chiaki
and the others...

203
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:11,842
calling me outside yesterday.

204
00:16:11,918 --> 00:16:15,376
But I can't even remember
how I got home after that.

205
00:16:15,922 --> 00:16:17,389
Give me a break!

206
00:16:17,457 --> 00:16:20,255
You can't tease me like that.

207
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:22,723
I'm not lying.

208
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:29,528
But you totally outmaneuvered
Chiaki and the others!

209
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:32,402
You took their panties and
put them on their heads!

210
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:35,839
There's no way I can believe
that you can't remember!

211
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:40,041
I really, really can't remember!

212
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,175
Something... something must
be wrong with my head!

213
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:48,354
You don't need to worry
about it, really!

214
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:52,255
Nami, you're so pretty
and strong, and cool.

215
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:54,355
It really knocked me out!

216
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:58,553
"Nami"? You mean me?

217
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:03,129
Yeah, that's what you
told me to call you.

218
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:04,236
Nami.

219
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:16,179
Man, if you can't remember
all that wild stuff you did...

220
00:17:16,249 --> 00:17:18,149
it's like a split
personality!

221
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:18,912
Precisely!

222
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:19,952
Huh?

223
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:23,386
I'm Manami's other
personality; Nami.

224
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:24,655
It's a pleasure.

225
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:26,490
Get lost!

226
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:30,493
The gentle beauty, Manami.

227
00:17:31,264 --> 00:17:35,200
I realized that hidden inside,
she had a split personality.

228
00:17:35,268 --> 00:17:39,170
The diametrically opposed
personality, called Nami.

229
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:42,172
But neither her mom or dad...

230
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:45,473
not to mention Manami
herself knew about it.

231
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:49,574
Sometimes she merely suffers
from memory loss...

232
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:52,447
but that alone seems to
have really shocked her.

233
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:55,112
There's no way I can tell
her the whole truth.

234
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:57,613
So what does that mean?

235
00:17:57,724 --> 00:18:00,124
Only I know this Nami person?

236
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:02,150
That's...

237
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:08,327
This is not amusing!!!

238
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:14,937
Manami and Nami
Sprite

239
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:29,420
Let's see... Huh?

240
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:30,955
That's strange.

241
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:34,155
What's the matter?

242
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:37,059
Nothing. No problem.

243
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:41,390
What'll I do? My bra and
panties are missing!

244
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:45,567
You don't seem very chipper,
Manami, what's wrong?

245
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:49,870
Oh, it's just that we have
swimming in gym tomorrow.

246
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:54,241
What, can't you swim or
something?

247
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:55,508
I can so!

248
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:57,048
Then what's the problem?

249
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,847
Well, you know...

250
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:03,381
I've gotta wear a swim
suit, right?

251
00:19:04,324 --> 00:19:05,348
Huh?

252
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:10,320
Yeah, not many people go into
the pool in their uniforms.

253
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,497
That's not what I meant.

254
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:13,725
It's just...

255
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,560
You mean you're shy, right?

256
00:19:18,504 --> 00:19:19,528
Mm-hm.

257
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,271
You don't have anything
to feel shy about, Manami.

258
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:25,743
You've got a great body!

259
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:28,110
You should be proud of it!

260
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:29,675
But still...

261
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:41,654
That's strange.

262
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:43,025
If this were Nami...

263
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:47,624
she'd have way more fun
in the pool than in a class.

264
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:53,997
Come off it, Toru!

265
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:56,337
What are you smiling about?

266
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:02,778
Oh, it's just that I'm a pretty
good swimmer myself!

267
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:11,555
She scared me, her eyes
look just like Nami's.

268
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:14,320
Well, they're one and
the same person, after all.

269
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,670
The shy Manami, and the
outgoing Nami.

270
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:34,036
They're both actually Manami.

271
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:38,647
She'd be the ideal woman if she
were a perfect blend of the two.

272
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:46,057
Or else if she could choose her
personality anytime she wanted...

273
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,020
Transform!

274
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:51,354
Yeah, right.

275
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:54,026
Nami's here!

276
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:58,529
Then she wouldn't have any
problems in the pool, either.

277
00:20:58,838 --> 00:21:00,271
Hey, wait a second.

278
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,636
The other day...

279
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:11,113
Was it when I called her Nami?

280
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,485
N-N-No way!

281
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:48,182
Seeing her like that,
Sakumoto's pretty hot, huh?

282
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:50,420
She's got a childlike face.

283
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,822
But her hooters are
surprisingly big!

284
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:55,360
And she's got a tiny waist!

285
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:06,033
You're so lucky, living with
a cute babe like her, Toru!

286
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:09,935
Well, it's not all fun and
games, you know.

287
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,780
You lame brain! You're
really pissing me off!

288
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:17,645
Strip!

289
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:19,116
No! Stop it!

290
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:21,644
Let's see your butt hole!

291
00:22:21,721 --> 00:22:23,621
Cut it out!

292
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,384
Those guys are such
loudmouths!

293
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:22,937
Huh?

294
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,142
That's strange.

295
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:28,276
What's the matter?

296
00:23:28,888 --> 00:23:31,220
Nothing. No problem.

297
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:38,689
What'll I do? My bra and
panties are missing!

298
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:47,329
What a drag.

299
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,170
And I just took my gym
clothes home, too.

300
00:23:50,443 --> 00:23:54,539
I hope I make it through last
class without anyone noticing.

301
00:23:54,614 --> 00:23:57,105
Oh, Miss Sakumoto!

302
00:23:58,985 --> 00:24:00,543
Something the matter?

303
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,316
Your chest seems a bit chilly.

304
00:24:07,526 --> 00:24:10,359
Going bra-less, even
with those big tits?

305
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,592
You like feeling liberated, huh?

306
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,225
How does she know?

307
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:18,834
Did she take my bra
and panties?

308
00:24:19,405 --> 00:24:21,771
Hey, you got something
to say?

309
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:24,404
Well, Miss Lib.

310
00:24:24,744 --> 00:24:28,236
Maybe you're liberated under
that skirt of yours, huh?

311
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,218
No, you couldn't have...

312
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,651
What?

313
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,278
Got something to say?

314
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:37,886
Well?

315
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:43,957
No, forget it.

316
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:47,623
Oh, I sure wish I could've
gone swimming, too.

317
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:50,665
But I've got my period,
so I was out of luck.

318
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:55,438
And now, I'll give her
a real taste of revenge!

319
00:25:18,698 --> 00:25:20,131
No...

320
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,468
Why's this happening
to me?

321
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:26,001
I wish I could just disappear!

322
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:30,137
No, you mustn't run away!

323
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:43,318
Aren't you upset about what
happened to you?

324
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,348
Now, do exactly as I say!

325
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:19,854
Lift up Manami's skirt
in front of everybody!

326
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:20,983
B-But...

327
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,826
If you don't, I'll throw out
these panties you stole!

328
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:27,765
- Give them back!
- See...

329
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:31,469
Okay, how about this?

330
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,505
If you do as I say, I'll
give these back to you.

331
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:38,936
And I'll also give you
my panties.

332
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:41,809
- Okay?
- I don't want yours...

333
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:48,713
If you don't want everyone
to know you're the panty thief...

334
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:50,779
then do it and don't
give me any lip!

335
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:52,721
Right...

336
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:54,884
Hey, did you hear?

337
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:56,626
Hear what?

338
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:58,697
About Sakumoto, in the
next class.

339
00:26:58,731 --> 00:27:02,531
She's going bra-less and
panty-less today!!

340
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,068
What? Seriously?

341
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,404
With her body?

342
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:07,531
You!

343
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:09,437
Quit being ridiculous!

344
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:11,567
What're you talking about?

345
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,235
Well, Chiaki told everybody.

346
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:15,903
What?

347
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,209
Chiaki did?

348
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:18,250
That hag!

349
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:20,747
Wait, Takamura!

350
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:22,686
Class is gonna start!

351
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:25,055
I'm skipping out today!

352
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:29,420
Figures. He's gotta get
a peek for himself!

353
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:34,659
Crap!

354
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:37,099
Chiaki skipped swimming
class...

355
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:39,763
to get even for
the other day!

356
00:27:42,141 --> 00:27:45,076
If Manami can't stop
Chiaki by herself...

357
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:46,702
and I show up all
nonchalant...

358
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,513
If there's one thing
I can do!

359
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:29,119
That triangle... that square...

360
00:28:32,124 --> 00:28:34,649
Square means tofu...

361
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,625
Tofu is white...

362
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:39,391
White means panties...

363
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:55,543
If everyone finds out
you're the panty thief...

364
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:57,343
you'll be kicked out
of college!

365
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:58,882
Kicked out!

366
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:43,888
What do you think you're
trying to pull?

367
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:46,094
OWWWW!!!!

368
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:50,066
Your class is over there!!

369
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:06,148
Quit whispering in the
shadows!

370
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:09,244
If you wanna check, like him,
then get over here and check!

371
00:30:13,392 --> 00:30:15,383
C-Cool!

372
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:16,893
That's right!

373
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:18,793
If she can stand up
there and say that...

374
00:30:18,864 --> 00:30:20,559
then it's gotta be a lie!

375
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:21,600
Yeah!

376
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,602
I won't let anyone say such
bad things about Manami!

377
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,969
You sure had a different
opinion of her a minute ago!

378
00:30:39,051 --> 00:30:42,145
I honestly didn't go because
I had my period!

379
00:30:42,655 --> 00:30:44,418
Let's see about that.

380
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:46,616
Toru, pin her down!

381
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:48,424
Who, me?

382
00:30:48,494 --> 00:30:50,086
Just shut up and do it!

383
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:51,957
Let me see!

384
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:55,631
No! What're you doing, idiot?

385
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:59,735
It does look like you've
got your period.

386
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:02,000
Then you've gotta believe me!

387
00:31:02,074 --> 00:31:05,373
I just happened to see old Flatfish
stealing your underwear!

388
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:09,311
Hey, get out of my bag!

389
00:31:09,748 --> 00:31:14,117
Then tell me just how these
got into your bag, Chiaki.

390
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:16,419
Well, uh...

391
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:18,319
I made him give them to me!

392
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:22,416
Then explain why you didn't
say anything about it.

393
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:24,318
I, uh...

394
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:28,456
I couldn't help it!

395
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:33,471
He threatened to steal mine
unless I kept quiet about it!

396
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:34,563
You liar!

397
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,607
Lie!

398
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:45,283
Ah, that feels better!

399
00:31:45,451 --> 00:31:48,682
Come on, how about cutting
back on the violence?

400
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:50,415
You'll get Manami in trouble.

401
00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:53,686
Then you should've called
me out sooner.

402
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,456
Yeah, but I didn't think things
would turn out that well.

403
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:01,488
They did because you skipped
class today and came to help.

404
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:03,194
Yeah, I guess.

405
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,294
We're home!

406
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:09,472
Oh, mom and dad aren't
home yet.

407
00:32:10,776 --> 00:32:14,405
By the way, how do I get
Nami to turn back into Manami?

408
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:18,577
I usually just turn back
by the morning.

409
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,407
I get it!

410
00:32:20,486 --> 00:32:23,182
Are you thinking of being
naughty with me...

411
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:24,552
while I'm Nami?

412
00:32:26,024 --> 00:32:27,958
D-Don't be ridiculous!

413
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,560
I'm just honestly worried,
that's all!

414
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:33,894
Geez, all I did was ask!

415
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:34,762
Huh?

416
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:38,901
Manami wouldn't do it
even if you asked her!

417
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:41,732
Quit teasing me!

418
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:43,699
You'll get Manami in trouble!

419
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:47,070
This is just my way
of saying thanks.

420
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:49,171
It'll be our little secret.

421
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:51,240
S-secret?

422
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:06,698
Wh-Wh-What are you doing
with a bare butt?

423
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,562
Chiaki gave them back,
right?

424
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:12,098
Yeah, but this way feels
a lot freer!

425
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:17,600
When Manami returned
to her self...

426
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:20,236
she couldn't remember this,
luckily.

427
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:22,644
That Nami!

428
00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:26,741
Quit acting, when you're
obviously thrilled!

429
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:36,760
Manami and Nami
Sprite

430
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:03,280
M-Manami!

431
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:08,759
What, isn't this what you
always do with Masaya?

432
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:12,292
It's not like that, Manami!

433
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:13,822
Toru...

434
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:15,160
Toru...

435
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:18,425
You idiot!

436
00:34:22,441 --> 00:34:24,409
Nami! Nami!

437
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:26,909
Come out! I'm begging you!

438
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:31,408
What's with all the groping?

439
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,608
You couldn't handle dealing
with Manami, so you called me.

440
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:37,454
B-Bingo.

441
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:41,853
Hate to disappoint you, but
you're not getting your way.

442
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:43,326
Because I'm pissed.

443
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:44,523
Huh?

444
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:46,223
How come you're mad, too?

445
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:47,996
Shut up!

446
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:49,624
Show some remorse!

447
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:51,191
You double-crosser!

448
00:34:51,637 --> 00:34:53,127
Wait... Nami!

449
00:34:57,209 --> 00:34:58,699
Hello, Miss Imai?

450
00:34:58,777 --> 00:35:00,005
This is Toru Takamura.

451
00:35:00,078 --> 00:35:01,875
Know where Manami is?

452
00:35:02,147 --> 00:35:03,341
She's not back yet...

453
00:35:03,415 --> 00:35:06,782
Well, she did come back
for a bit, but she's out again.

454
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:08,015
Yeah.

455
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:11,212
Let me know if you
hear from her.

456
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:16,717
Where could Nami have
gone to, anyway?

457
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,708
Nami!

458
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:50,350
What's gotten into you?
You're soaked!

459
00:35:51,863 --> 00:35:54,331
I... I...

460
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,362
I'm disappearing...

461
00:35:57,669 --> 00:35:58,931
What?

462
00:36:02,107 --> 00:36:03,574
Nami! Nami!

463
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:07,369
NAMI!!!!
