1
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,179
The target is a weapons technician.

2
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,759
He called in several prostitutes...

3
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,193
and impulsively started
to slaughter them.

4
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:48,805
It seems he is compulsively committing
crime, due to LMJP.

5
00:00:56,214 --> 00:01:01,584
Good. It feels good. Good.

6
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:04,952
Use your hands more.

7
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:11,017
Make me come hard, or I'll snuff you, too.

8
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:13,326
Don't stop!

9
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:26,735
All in position!

10
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:29,706
- Okay, let's go.
- Yes, sir!

11
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,891
One-o-three, report!
What happened, 103?

12
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:58,069
I can't feel anything. You suck!

13
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:05,340
No! Help!

14
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,816
Bastard! He's killed two!

15
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:10,082
We can't muscle our way in.
Give me A's ETA.

16
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,922
Who's next?

17
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,622
No!

18
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,978
Okay, where are you coming from?

19
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:01,061
Mission accomplished.

20
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,430
The target is dead.

21
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:05,403
It seems the perpetrator has been killed.

22
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:06,635
Storm in right away
and rescue the hostages.

23
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:09,077
Roger. Waiting for next command.

24
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,042
What is it? Someone's jamming it?

25
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:28,622
Xinn.

26
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,570
September 1st, 2039.

27
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:41,004
All the computers connected
to the Network froze.

28
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,106
All the computers repeated four letters...

29
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,981
X-I-N-N for 1 second...

30
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:52,317
and the phenomenon was over.

31
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:59,123
This one second blink by the Network,
an immense virtual organism...

32
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:03,027
caused immeasurable damage
to the human race.

33
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:06,861
A terror literally akin
to a frozen moment in time....

34
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,531
sent a shockwave throughout the world,

35
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,743
"Connect"

36
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:54,015
It's so good, Kaoru. Give me more.

37
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:22,010
If you keep up like this, I'll come.

38
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,248
I can't hold back anymore.

39
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:34,616
So good.

40
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:44,392
Go ahead, Kaoru. Come inside me.

41
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,502
I can't.

42
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:06,955
There is only one conclusion, Kaoru.

43
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:11,727
The question is, who am I?

44
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:13,161
What?

45
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,573
To me, Kaoru,
it's like we are a part of each other.

46
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:26,536
I love...

47
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,190
That dream again.

48
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,791
- Hello?
- Sorry to wake you up,

49
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,429
A request placed through
the American Embassy?

50
00:06:50,802 --> 00:06:52,793
Sounds complicated.

51
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,436
You don't need to
bother with reasons why.

52
00:07:00,078 --> 00:07:02,273
It's none of my business.

53
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:07,517
The main passage to the city's
upper Level will be crowded,

54
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:10,913
Use our special elevator,

55
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,424
One more thing,

56
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:17,686
As soon as you arrive at the scene,
retrieve the supply,

57
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:19,229
Supply?

58
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:24,130
The target is Massy Spector, 18 years old,

59
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:27,666
Requesting a refugee status,
He's hoping we'll assist him,

60
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:51,857
"Hoping we'll assist him..."

61
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:55,029
Too bad.

62
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,803
I'm Massy Spector.

63
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:02,196
I'm Ishikawa, from the Intelligence Division.

64
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,268
Have a seat.

65
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:11,548
Let's talk about your request for refugee
status in our nation.

66
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:15,045
Let's try not to read between the lines.

67
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,646
Or shall I say,
let's not play a three-penny opera.

68
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:25,658
You know, Japan and the States have been
in the same bed so a long time.

69
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:27,928
You!

70
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:33,899
I taught that sofa a little trick.

71
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:38,868
It's 8-G now. Shall I make you heavier?

72
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,817
I don't have such poor taste,
as to watch as your body is...

73
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:49,418
squashed like a tomato.

74
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,923
Imperial National Security
Investigation Agency.

75
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:57,824
Special Intelligence Force,
Kaoru Mikogami.

76
00:08:58,463 --> 00:08:59,828
What?

77
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:03,761
So you're an assassin
from the Imperial Intelligence.

78
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,860
How do you know?

79
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:09,131
I don't know how.

80
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:11,967
I just know, that's all.

81
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,201
Good bye.

82
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:21,916
What?

83
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:25,881
I shut off the Artificial Gravitational Field.

84
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:31,294
Are you hurt?

85
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:35,823
No, I'm fine.

86
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:38,196
Who are you?

87
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:40,362
Alice. Call me Alice.

88
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:42,906
I have been supplied for you, as of today.

89
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:45,132
Supplied?

90
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:47,142
Are you a robot?

91
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,938
Yes, Mr. Kaoru Mikogami.

92
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:53,949
No way. It's just an illusion.

93
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:01,958
Leaked?

94
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:05,194
Massy's assassination plan
had been leaked?

95
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:07,423
Yes. He knew about it.

96
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:09,926
Also he...

97
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:12,562
knew me.

98
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:17,669
I am a little suspicious of the client,
as a matter of fact.

99
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:21,439
So it was good idea that I send out Alice.

100
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:24,246
So, what is this?

101
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:28,014
It's a weapon developed
by the Untied States Army.

102
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,352
They loaned us one, and that's that.

103
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:36,457
And I remembered you wanted
help before, so here it is.

104
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:39,520
I wanted human help.

105
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:42,662
Not a sex toy. It's in a poor taste.

106
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:50,538
Sex toy. That'd be another way to use it.

107
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:52,608
Chief!

108
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:55,175
This has killed more people...

109
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,471
than you have.

110
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:59,678
That can't be.

111
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,980
Please use me like a firearm.

112
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,218
I was created for that purpose.

113
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:20,170
Mr. Mikogami.

114
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,269
Kanako, working late again?

115
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,601
I've been analyzing the XINN phenomenon.

116
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:31,811
The progress is so slow, it drives me crazy.

117
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:35,277
XINN. I remember that.

118
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:39,112
It happened only a month ago.

119
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,588
Why don't you leave that to the old man,
slouching in the chair next door?

120
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:45,222
You fought with Chief?

121
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:48,824
Because of that girl?

122
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,991
She is a very good girl.

123
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:54,495
There's no good or bad.

124
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,163
It's a machine, either it works or not.

125
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:01,673
How did a US Army toy come
to us in the first place?

126
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:04,081
It's not just for us.

127
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:10,212
Before she was sent over here,
Alice was stationed at...

128
00:12:10,454 --> 00:12:14,015
the Marines Corp,
a SWAT team and many other places.

129
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,284
I think they want it
to accumulate experiential data...

130
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,160
so they can use it as a basis
for mass production.

131
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,860
It's invincible.

132
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,027
Pedophiles will fall for it at once.

133
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:30,036
Like Chief says, when it is not in need...

134
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:33,307
it can help out our men's desire.

135
00:12:46,424 --> 00:12:48,654
I'm tired today.

136
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,721
I'm going home to bed.

137
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:29,789
Chief instructed me to await
your instructions here.

138
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,895
That old man, what's he thinking?

139
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:37,771
May I set up my maintenance
supplies over here?

140
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,841
Wait.

141
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:43,238
I don't like to clutter up my living room.

142
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,241
I understand.

143
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:48,814
Please instruct me where would be
the optimal location.

144
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,619
The open space right now
would be the kitchen.

145
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:55,820
I understand.

146
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,823
You have one mail,

147
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:07,527
Bro, been a while!

148
00:14:07,838 --> 00:14:08,805
Mamoru.

149
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:12,965
Are you alive and well?
You haven't called me in a while,

150
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,642
What, you got a girlfriend?

151
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:17,442
No way,

152
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:46,137
Good morning.

153
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:50,075
How long have you been there?

154
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,607
For about 15 seconds.

155
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:57,144
And I didn't notice?

156
00:14:59,056 --> 00:15:00,853
Is breakfast ready?

157
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,156
What? Breakfast?

158
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:06,058
I did not receive that order.

159
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:08,296
I was joking.

160
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,057
How can I expect company property
to do that?

161
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,503
Joking?

162
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:16,667
Joking?

163
00:15:16,907 --> 00:15:20,365
Yes. I do not understand Kaoru very well.

164
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:25,814
He was probably being shy
about what he'd said.

165
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,747
Shy. Blush. Embarrass.

166
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:34,121
I still do not understand.

167
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,755
Maybe it's still too difficult for you.

168
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,321
Yes, it is difficult.

169
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:44,726
J. H. Brooks. 36 years old.

170
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:48,265
An Al Software researcher
at Digital Demand Corp.

171
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:52,306
Digital Demand?

172
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,938
Their technician is our target?

173
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,043
For security purposes.

174
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:58,780
I see.

175
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:02,449
Who's the girl?

176
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:05,453
She's the key to this operation.

177
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:07,953
Brooks is extremely cautious.

178
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:11,318
His security system is perfect,
and he rarely goes out.

179
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,892
But he seems to have a bad habit.

180
00:16:18,903 --> 00:16:20,268
You're kidding.

181
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,629
A perfect operation for Alice.

182
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,605
Are you okay with this?

183
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:26,499
I have nothing against it.

184
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:29,474
Mr. Mikogami.

185
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:35,981
I researched various recipes.

186
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,778
This appeared to be the most
generic combination.

187
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,388
When did I order you to prepare
a breakfast?

188
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:46,086
This is my self-judgment.

189
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:47,557
Your what?

190
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:50,395
I judged this was within
the operative parameters...

191
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:54,262
that defines my non-operational
hour activities.

192
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:59,739
I don't intend to have a live-in maid.

193
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,334
Kaoru.

194
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,712
I'll eat. Let me wash my face first.

195
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:07,275
The Headquarters has contacted.

196
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:10,952
Commence the operation
today at 2300 hours.

197
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:19,024
A perfect Ninth Heaven.

198
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,630
I finally got it.

199
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:29,596
It's working!

200
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,908
So this is MJP.

201
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:42,918
One hour until full charge.

202
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:47,357
Why are you upset?

203
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,956
Alice has completed her missions...

204
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:53,359
but her emotional side is undeveloped.

205
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,958
In the States, they probably cared only
about her mission success rate...

206
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,628
and didn't concern themselves
with her emotions.

207
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:02,166
It's still the same.

208
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,866
It is not!

209
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:08,837
Take breakfast, for instance.
Alice is trying to get close to you.

210
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:11,848
I just can't stand this.

211
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:16,710
You're overreacting.

212
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,785
But, I know. My intuition tells me.

213
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,122
For someone working in this field,
you're surprisingly irrational.

214
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,631
Because I'm just like Alice.

215
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,662
Kanako?

216
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:39,402
You know what happened to me before...

217
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:46,209
Being raped, by the agents...

218
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:48,507
Sort of.

219
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,121
All I can say is that it was unfortunate.

220
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,624
Call us agents and it makes
us sound important...

221
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:58,355
but we're just murderers.

222
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,523
Something's wrong with us. Including me.

223
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:04,356
Kanako?

224
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:10,702
I love you, Kaoru.

225
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,229
I want to be with you, Mr. Mikogami.

226
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,838
You can rape me. Please.

227
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:48,878
Right there.

228
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,812
No.

229
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:54,082
Silly.

230
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:56,581
We don't call this rape.

231
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:03,884
Kaoru.

232
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:07,094
No.

233
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,641
- Does it hurt?
- A little.

234
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:21,968
It's been a while.

235
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:24,180
Then I'll go slow.

236
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,089
Okay now?

237
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:37,519
Yes, okay.

238
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,208
Wonderful, Kaoru.

239
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,546
Something's weird with my body.

240
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,114
I can't. No more.

241
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,888
I can't, Kaoru!

242
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:22,062
You're new. Come in.

243
00:21:45,462 --> 00:21:48,761
I can't stand your doll-like face.

244
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,519
Enemy System Check.

245
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,448
Multiple operatives confirmed.

246
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,990
Five operatives confirmed, all armed.

247
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:18,493
Armed? It's a trap!

248
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:24,464
Don't worry about me.
Complete the mission.

249
00:22:27,337 --> 00:22:29,032
Roger.

250
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:40,477
Brooks is aware of the operation.

251
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:43,811
Danger. Please retreat immediately.

252
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,249
Alice!

253
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,328
Mamoru?

254
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,169
Bro?

255
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:03,703
Freeze! Security Police!

256
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:05,739
Security Police?

257
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:09,006
What's going on? Why are you here?

258
00:23:09,713 --> 00:23:13,274
We got an information that armed
terrorists are hiding here.

259
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,080
Why are you here?

260
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:18,045
Armed terrorists?

261
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:20,248
Shit, they tricked us!

262
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:24,360
You guys wait here, okay?

263
00:23:25,062 --> 00:23:27,189
On whose authority?

264
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:29,357
They played you guys.

265
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:33,694
- There's no terrorist around here.
- What?

266
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,761
Listen, don't move.

267
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:37,900
Hey, wait!

268
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,700
Bro...

269
00:23:45,816 --> 00:23:47,044
Alice!

270
00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:48,812
Mr. Mikogami.

271
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,513
Please, retreat. This room is...

272
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,588
Game over.

273
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:57,155
A detonator? A bomb?

274
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,799
I've staged a scenario for you and the
Security Police to kill each other.

275
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:08,194
You manipulated information, didn't you?

276
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:12,865
That's very easy for me, Mr. Mikogami.

277
00:24:15,846 --> 00:24:18,041
This brainwave belongs to...

278
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,512
I never die.

279
00:24:22,552 --> 00:24:24,076
Massy.

280
00:24:24,554 --> 00:24:28,854
Even if this body dies,
I will come to see you again.

281
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:30,590
Spector.

282
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:32,194
No way.

283
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:36,259
That is, if you don't die now.

284
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:40,602
Raise your hands!

285
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,065
Alice!

286
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,198
Alice!

287
00:27:08,552 --> 00:27:10,679
Led by something mysterious...

288
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,212
Kaoru and Alice begin to share
their feelings,

289
00:27:15,492 --> 00:27:18,188
Meanwhile, Kaoru's sister Mamoru
follows a lead on...

290
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:22,129
Ninth Heaven, only to fall into the clutch
of an Underground Organization,

291
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:25,191
Luv Wave, the 2nd Process, "Protocol."

292
00:27:25,635 --> 00:27:28,069
Someone is sleeping there.
