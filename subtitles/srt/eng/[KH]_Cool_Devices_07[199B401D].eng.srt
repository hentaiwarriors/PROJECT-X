1
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,380
Mr. Fujisawa?

2
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,780
Sorry I'm so late.

3
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,919
It was only 2 or 3 minutes, Rieko.

4
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,354
I've got our table reserved, so let's go.

5
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,823
Before we go, Mr. Fujisawa,
let me introduce you.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,524
This is my daughter, Ayana.

7
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,402
How do you do?

8
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:20,271
Shook hands?

9
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,840
Yeah. Not really the usual
way to introduce yourself.

10
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,815
He was probably playing around.

11
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,215
Anything besides the handshake?

12
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:33,486
One other thing. He has
REALLY huge hands.

13
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,792
So, he's a real he-man, huh?

14
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:39,930
Yeah. Hard-boiled. A real authority figure.

15
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,534
A crime prevention
detective, huh? Is he cool?

16
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,302
Yeah, I guess on first
glance. He's just so big!

17
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,376
Go in!

18
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,679
So, she's remarrying a
detective. That's sorta unusual.

19
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,651
He's sort of famous, too.

20
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,387
They say he's a hero.

21
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,121
Have you seen his, you know...?

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,058
I have. I've even held it.

23
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,594
Really?! That's so cool!

24
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,897
But he brought it home.

25
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:20,672
Mom was out and he was cleaning
it on the dining room table.

26
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,430
I hated it, but just had to watch.

27
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,009
It was yesterday.

28
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,642
Now don't be so tense.

29
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,915
Relax your shoulders a little more, Ayana.

30
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,476
Invite me over next time!

31
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,211
I can't do that.

32
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,586
All right, then, I'll just have to get bigger!

33
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,652
Forget it!

34
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,104
Now, where did it go?

35
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:19,088
I didn't tell anyone about
the Yellow Star case. Relax.

36
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,279
What the hell is this?

37
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,276
Don't be too showy when you sell it.

38
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,678
I hear you.

39
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,125
I have one left over. You can have it back.

40
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,160
You can keep it. It'll come
in handy for something.

41
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,429
I'm sure.

42
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:29,732
Yeah.

43
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,931
So, Fujisawa, how's the new family?

44
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,598
Must be fun everyday.

45
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,275
We only just got married.
Haven't had a chance yet.

46
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,244
She hasn't seen what an animal you are yet.

47
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,106
See this?

48
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,453
My new daughter.

49
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,221
Cute...

50
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,998
Call us next time and
let us in on the fun, too.

51
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,025
When I get the chance.

52
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,880
STUDYING! KEEP OUT!

53
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,947
Please, just wait a little longer.

54
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,245
You always do this just
as we're getting ready!

55
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,581
After exams... We can do it then.

56
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,857
Will you keep your promise this time?

57
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:31,462
Maybe...

58
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:32,995
Ayana!

59
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,263
Don't look at me like that!

60
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,463
I'll keep my promise, Kohei!

61
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,996
God, she's cute!

62
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,104
You better keep it!

63
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,202
If you don't, I might have to force you!

64
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,813
If you did, you'd drown
in here from all the tears!

65
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,762
Well, see you tomorrow.

66
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,199
Has he gone home?

67
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,067
You were home?!

68
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,339
But mom said you'd be home late tonight!

69
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,042
I wasn't feeling well and
slept in my basement office.

70
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:26,941
Are you all right?

71
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,019
Yeah.

72
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,213
Finals are coming up. Do your best.

73
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,386
I'm working on it. Don't worry.

74
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,467
A promise, huh?

75
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,751
Ayana, do you remember your promise?

76
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:09,988
I do.

77
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,097
I'm coming over today.

78
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,428
All right.

79
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,301
She'll be out of the country for a week.

80
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,697
Mom's such a workaholic.

81
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,667
I'll enjoy it.

82
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,202
Won't you be lonely by yourself?

83
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:31,274
Nope. A wonderful show is about to start.

84
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:35,585
And the stars are you and me, Ayana.

85
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,119
What's that supposed to mean?

86
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,356
You'll know soon.

87
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:44,957
He'll be here soon!

88
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,232
Exams are over, right?

89
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,235
Yeah, but Kohei and I will be
studying together tonight.

90
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,600
He's coming over?

91
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,174
I can't let you.

92
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,947
We're going to have some
fun downstairs, Ayana.

93
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,756
Wh- Wha...?

94
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,569
It's a mild hallucinogen with a stimulant.

95
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,806
It'll just take away your
strength for about an hour.

96
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,738
Don't worry. You'll be back
to normal in 4 or 5 hours.

97
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,949
Today, for sure!

98
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,294
No!

99
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,563
I can't stand it... You smell so good!

100
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,000
Please, let me go!

101
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,100
No!

102
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,072
No!

103
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,618
Does it feel nice?

104
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,280
I can make you feel even better.

105
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,990
Yellow Star magnifies
the feeling several times.

106
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,518
She's not home. For crying out loud!

107
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,234
You've got a nice body.

108
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,945
Way too nice for Kohei.

109
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,390
Wet so soon, Ayana?

110
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,661
No!

111
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,459
First, the fingers...

112
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,698
Don't!

113
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,670
No!

114
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,558
No! No! No!

115
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,204
Forglve me, Kohel!

116
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:15,958
I'm coming!

117
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,179
This is our little secret.

118
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:38,818
Got that?

119
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,390
I came by yesterday.

120
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,265
Something came up. Sorry...

121
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,663
What do you mean something came up?

122
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,583
Can I come today?

123
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,931
I'm busy today, too.

124
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,775
What's with her?

125
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,172
Swallow it.

126
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:09,813
Do it.

127
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,885
Don't let your teeth hit it.

128
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,053
Your tongue. Use your tongue.

129
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,296
That feels good.

130
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,097
Where are we going?

131
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,465
For a change of pace.

132
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,076
This is strange. Aren't we
going to have sex like usual?

133
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:52,277
There are special relationships
to keep up in my sideline.

134
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:59,150
They're complaining about
me keeping you to myself.

135
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:01,793
Swallow this.

136
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:35,784
Who are you?!

137
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,695
Have I got a sight for you two.

138
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,934
We've been waiting for this, Miss.

139
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,212
I can't do that again.

140
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,889
You reacted like you always do.

141
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,594
Especially when you're with me.

142
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,024
Because of the drug.

143
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,261
Should I call your boyfriend next time, too?

144
00:17:55,641 --> 00:18:01,136
Lt'd be funny to tell him about
our warm little relationship.

145
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,842
Next time we should try
doing it in front of him.

146
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:35,807
You took my gun... Are you nuts?!

147
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,248
Give it back.

148
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,086
Are you serious, Ayana?

149
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,314
You...!

150
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,366
Oh, you're shittin' me...

151
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:12,209
MYSTERIOUS EXPLOSION
ROCKS APARTMENT BUILDING!

152
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,108
POLICE SUSPECT DRUG RING

153
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:19,047
DETECTIVE KILLED IN EXPLOSION

154
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,719
It's not like it was your fault.

155
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,047
Don't beat yourself up over it.

156
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:32,792
Right... Kohei, he and I...

157
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,224
It's nothing.

158
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,766
Thanks for coming today.

159
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,273
What's keeping him?!

160
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,587
So, here you are. Remember us?

161
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,429
What, you can't recognize
us with our clothes on?

162
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,664
This time you'll be partying with us.

163
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,965
For a long, long time.

164
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:28,319
Huh?
