1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,430
I remember Shinya-kun's face.

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,110
I couldn't bear to look at it.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,910
He blamed himself for Narumi-chan's death.

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,310
He deserves to!

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,910
If only he hadn't played around with Narumi and her feelings...

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,630
I know you're not really thinking that.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,230
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,750
I-I mean every word of it!

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,950
However, you can't blame a person for someone else's death.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,750
Mao-chan!

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,830
Death is a destiny you can't escape.

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,870
Thanks for coming.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,270
The important thing is to live a happy life.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,070
Narumi lived her life the way she wanted to.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,070
She came to know happiness.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,190
You're just trying to excuse your helplessness!

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,030
You know it was going to happen. You can tell the future!

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,790
You knew that she was sick...

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,190
and you knew she was going to die!

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,150
I won't deny it!

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,270
That's my power.

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,750
The bow's fortune telling shows a destiny none can avoid.

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,590
Mao-chan was always there for Narumi-chan,

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,310
even though she knew that
Narumi-chan's life would be short.

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,590
I know, but that's what makes me mad.

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,550
She was about to find happiness.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,110
Why was fate so cruel to her?

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,790
Yes, fate is cruel.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,470
Both for those who die, and those who are left behind.

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,070
Shinya also cursed her fate.

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,070
That was when I met him.

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,230
It was destiny that led me to him.

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,790
Did you also foresee that?

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,910
I simply allowed my fortune telling and destiny to guide me.

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,270
The destiny I was entrusted with.

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,670
Flutter of Birds
Wings of Angel

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,750
Part 2: Fate

38
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,350
One Year Ago

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,990
Narumi-chan...

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,150
Shinya, you're going to catch a cold.

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,230
Let's go inside.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,390
Leave me alone!

43
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,870
I knew nothing about her --

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,710
neither the kind of illness she had,

45
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,310
nor her feelings when she gave her body to me.

46
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,790
I didn't know anything.

47
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,710
I had no right to be loved by her.

48
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,110
Shinya...

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,110
Shinya...

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,590
I'm making stew for dinner tonight.

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,510
So please, do come back.

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,470
I'll be waiting.

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,550
I'm so bored.

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,430
Neither Kazura-chan nor Shinya have come here in a while.

55
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,470
Can you blame them after what happened?

56
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,030
This must be hard for them.

57
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,710
I still wish Kazura-chan would come.

58
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,110
Although whenever she's here,

59
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,070
she complains that the tea is too hot,

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,910
or that the cake is too sweet.

61
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,110
Nothing but complaints.

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,990
Still, the place feels empty without her.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,990
Sorry for being such a bother to you.

64
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,590
H-How long have you been there?

65
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,030
Well, now I know what you think of me.

66
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,790
I was only joking.

67
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,710
I'll have some tea, preferably not too hot.

68
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,550
R-Right away.

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,390
I see you're doing better.

70
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,870
Well, I can't be sad forever.

71
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,950
Narumi would laugh at me.

72
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,070
I guess so.

73
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,510
What's wrong?

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,910
Why are you here?

75
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,070
I only wanted to...

76
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,350
Get out of here!

77
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,110
You just played with her feelings!

78
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,790
You have no right to be here!

79
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,270
You're right.

80
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,350
You're right. I have no right to be here.

81
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,190
H-Hey...

82
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,590
Wait!

83
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,030
Shinya-kun is taking a bit too long.

84
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,590
Shinya...

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,350
What's wrong?

86
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,430
I'm going to go find him.

87
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,350
You can't! It's late, and the snow's started.

88
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,870
I heard it! I heard Shinya's voice calling for help.

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,990
Yuzu...

90
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,270
It's really cold.

91
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,270
If I fall asleep here, I'll surely die.

92
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,790
That's not so bad, though.

93
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,790
If I die, I could see Narumi-chan again.

94
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,910
Oh, yeah. Yuzu is making stew for dinner.

95
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,150
Forgive me, Yuzu. I...

96
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,230
Naru--

97
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,830
Ah...

98
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,230
Awake now, are you?

99
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,270
I-I'm sorry. Um, did you save me out there?

100
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,190
Would it be better if I hadn't?

101
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,630
N-No, that's not what I meant.

102
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,550
I had no intention of saving you.

103
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,030
I'm not the kind of person who would stop someone from trying to die.

104
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,310
If your fate had been to die, I wouldn't have saved you.

105
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,310
My fate?

106
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,310
Death is a destiny no one can escape.

107
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,870
Just like Narumi.

108
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,910
You knew Narumi-chan!?

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,830
My bow foresaw what was going to happen,

110
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,150
but Narumi already knew her fate.

111
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,830
She didn't try to escape and accepted her lot.

112
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,030
She followed her own fate.

113
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,350
Are you telling me death was her fate?

114
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,150
I've told you already. No one can escape death.

115
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,270
That doesn't justify the death of a good girl like Narumi-chan!

116
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,230
Good or bad has nothing to do with it.

117
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,310
It was simply her fate.

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,470
You don't know what you're talking about!

119
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,390
What is fate? Who decides that fate?

120
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,350
Narumi-chan was finally able to leave her cage of a room!

121
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,630
She was about to live a life of happiness!

122
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,310
But despite that...

123
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,070
She was denied even the slightest joy!

124
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,510
I won't accept a fate like that!

125
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,790
I never will!

126
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,830
However, Narumi's death is real.

127
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,390
Humans can't change fate.

128
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,830
That can't be! We can change our fate!

129
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,950
There has to be more than one!

130
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,670
It's too late now, but Narumi must have had another one as well!

131
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,910
I-I'm sorry.

132
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,070
Don't worry,

133
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,470
I don't mind being with you, Shinya.

134
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,870
So please, look at me.

135
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,110
I have another reason for bringing you here.

136
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,670
I have a destiny to fulfill as well.

137
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,990
Your body doesn't lie.

138
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,310
Well, that's...

139
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,950
It's all right.

140
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,190
This may be my fate, but it's also my desire.

141
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,430
I carried you here to free you of your past with Narumi.

142
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,790
There's no need to hesitate. Please, sleep with me.

143
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,790
B-But that would just be cruel to you.

144
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,830
I'm Mao, Makimura Mao. That's my name.

145
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,150
Mao-chan?

146
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,350
Yes, Mao.

147
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,830
B-But I don't know anything about you.

148
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,390
If I sleep with you, I'll be going back on my word.

149
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,270
You're more stubborn than I thought, Shinya.

150
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,190
I'm not stubborn.

151
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,270
Relax. Like I said, this is what I want.

152
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,950
If this helps you move on from your past with Narumi and into the future...

153
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,870
I want you to show me.

154
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,150
Show me that fate can be changed.

155
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,550
Does that mean you know what will happen to me in the future?

156
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,990
I'm also looking for another destiny.

157
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,830
Do you think I can do that?

158
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,070
I do, and that's why I want you to prove it.

159
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,710
You can take responsibility for your own words, right?

160
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,510
You have me there.

161
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,390
Are you sure about this?

162
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,790
Are you cold?

163
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,870
A bit.

164
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,190
Shinya, come with me.

165
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,430
Here?

166
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,710
Don't embarrass me too much, okay?

167
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,790
Of course not.

168
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,590
You're so eager.

169
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,470
If you do that, I'll... I'll...

170
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,470
Do you like it?

171
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,150
Don't ask me that.

172
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,950
Looks like you like it, too.

173
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,390
A-Ah...

174
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,950
M-Mao...

175
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,390
Enjoy it. Enjoy it enough to forget about anything else.

176
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,270
Wait. If you keep going, I'll...

177
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,950
Come to me.

178
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,190
The two of us will become one, just like our destinies.

179
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,590
Mao...

180
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,710
Hurry, come inside.

181
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,430
Wonderful.

182
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,350
Amazing. You're all the way in!

183
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,270
Yes, so strong! More!

184
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,190
It's all the way in, Shinya...

185
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,870
Shinya! You're so good! It's all the way in!

186
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,030
So good! You're too good!

187
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,990
Mao! Mao!

188
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,750
Shinya...

189
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,390
Mao... Mao... I... I can't hold back anymore.

190
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,190
Yes, Shinya, cum. Give me your fate.

191
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,310
I'm almost... I'm almost there!

192
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,550
Mao!

193
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,190
Shinya! Shinya!

194
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,910
So much cum...

195
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,230
Feeling better?

196
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,550
I've done what I can.

197
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,830
Wh-What do you mean?

198
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,270
I can only show you the way.

199
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,910
Someone else must open the door and share your future.

200
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,030
What's that supposed to mean?

201
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,190
You haven't noticed, but that someone is already close to you.

202
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,030
Always looking after you...

203
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,990
Looking after me?

204
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,670
Shinya!

205
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,830
What's wrong?

206
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,870
I heard something. I heard a voice.

207
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,430
In this blizzard?

208
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,590
That voice... It's...

209
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,190
Mao!

210
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,070
Over there!

211
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,670
Where? I can't see anything.

212
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,270
Yuzu!

213
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,830
Yuzu, wake up! What are you doing here!?

214
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,510
Sh-Shinya...

215
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,950
I'm so glad. I finally found you.

216
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,190
Yuzu, hang on.

217
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,350
Yuzu! Don't go to sleep!

218
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,910
Open your eyes!

219
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,390
Yuzu! wake up!

220
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,550
Yuzu!

221
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,190
Yuzu...

222
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,150
Doctor, what's wrong with her?

223
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,990
She'll recover once her body warms up,

224
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,670
but there's a problem.

225
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,910
It can't be...

226
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,070
Wh-What is it?

227
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,510
You see, Yuzu has a form of amnesia.

228
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,910
Amnesia!?

229
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,950
Yuzu can't remember anything about her childhood.

230
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,470
But that's not all.

231
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,350
There's another aspect to her amnesia as well.

232
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,550
If something happens to her, it could trigger another lapse in memory.

233
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,110
Y-You mean her memory might disappear?

234
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,230
This time she might forget everything.

235
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,470
I can't believe this! Can't you do something?

236
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,550
I'm sorry, Sinclair-kun.

237
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,350
There's nothing I can do to help her.

238
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,630
Yuzu, open your eyes.

239
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,670
You promised to make stew for dinner, didn't you?

240
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,630
Don't sleep, okay? Wake up!

241
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,550
Please, wake up! Yuzu!

242
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,510
This is her fate.

243
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,550
Is this really the way it's supposed to be?

244
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,950
It's way too harsh on Shinya.

245
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,790
<i>Excuse me. This is the last stop.

246
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,030
<i>The last stop.

247
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,950
[Shinya Sinclair | Pick up Shinya at Kuramachi Station]
[Go with him to the church | Shinya          Wonderful]

248
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,870
<i>Shinya, you're wonderful.

249
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,590
<i>What?

250
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,390
<i>You're wonderful.

251
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,590
<i>Thank you.

252
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,350
<i>I'm Doll-Yuzu! I'll take over speaking for Yuzu!

253
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,350
<i>Why are you laughing?

254
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,070
[Shinya is sad... | I'm also sad.]
[I want to help him. What can I do? | Make him happy.]

255
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,990
[Dinner tonight. | Make stew for Shinya.]
[I hope it will cheer him up.]

256
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,230
Is this what Mao-chan was talking about?

257
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,070
Why didn't I realize it?

258
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,390
Yuzu, I'm here with you.

259
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,910
I'm by your side.

260
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,030
So, please come back.

261
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,630
Shinya-kun, did you stay up all night?

262
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,070
It's my fault this happened to her.

263
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,150
You're wrong. It's not your fault.

264
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,070
Her amnesia started long before she met you!

265
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,190
That doesn't matter.

266
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,830
Ever since I first came to this town, she's been looking after me.

267
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,030
Even so, I failed to realize it.

268
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,390
Shinya-kun...

269
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,910
Yuzu is still alive.

270
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,190
I don't want to lose anyone else... not again...

271
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,750
When Yuzu wakes up, there's a chance she won't remember you.

272
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,190
Can you handle that?

273
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,670
Even if she loses her memory and forgets about me,

274
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,070
she'll still be the same.

275
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,070
I see.

276
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,390
<i>Shinya-kun, now that I know how you feel,

277
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,910
<i>I'll leave her in your hands,

278
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,870
<i>but no matter what happens, don't run away again.

279
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,470
<i>Face whatever happens and accept it.

280
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,150
I wonder if there's something we can do to help them.

281
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,270
I've got it! Hey, Suzuha-chan, give me a hand!

282
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,950
Okay.

283
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,790
Come here!

284
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,550
Yes, come in.

285
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,070
Hello, we're from the cafeteria!

286
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,950
Room service at your disposal...

287
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,390
I haven't asked for anything, though.

288
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,190
Ta-da!

289
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,390
It's a gift from us.

290
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,310
We hope you'll like it.

291
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,270
You're very kind. I'm grateful.

292
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,710
It's been three months.

293
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,270
She still hasn't woken up.

294
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,030
This is a bad sign.

295
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,310
Is this her fate?

296
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,870
Of course, fate can change.

297
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,270
Shinya, show me.

298
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,270
Show me that the two of you can change fate.

299
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,630
Yuzu...

300
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,270
<i>There's nothing. I can't see anything. I feel nothing.

301
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,470
<i>I see, I'm locked in my own mind.

302
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,110
<i>The forgotten past, the vanished memories...

303
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,310
<i>I'll lose everything.

304
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,750
<i>Stil, if that's my fate... I...

305
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,830
<i>I won't be sad.

306
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,830
<i>I have nothing left to be sad about.

307
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,710
<i>No past left to lose.

308
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,590
<i>No precious memories.

309
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,110
Yuzu...

310
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,550
Who are you?

311
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,950
<i>Shinya!

312
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,430
<i>These are my memories of Shinya!

313
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,230
<i>Shinya is inside me!

314
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,910
<i>No, Shinya is disappearing!

315
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,270
My memories of Shinya!

316
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,390
My memories...

317
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,070
Yuzu!

318
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,470
<i>I have wonderful memories.

319
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,070
<i>Memories I don't want to lose or forget.

320
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,710
Yuzu, let's go home.

321
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,190
<i>Shinya! You're my future.

322
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,390
<i>Shinya!

323
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,590
No reaction. Maybe she's tired.

324
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,630
Yuzu!

325
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,910
Shin... ya...

326
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,870
Yuzu!

327
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,870
I'm not dreaming, right?

328
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,550
You've woken up.

329
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,270
Yes, I heard your voice.

330
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,750
Thank goodness. You haven't forgotten me.

331
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,070
I haven't.

332
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,750
Shinya, I have wonderful memories of you,

333
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,950
and you are my future as well.

334
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,630
Shinya, when I had nothing, you gave me memories.

335
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,750
I want to do more memorable things with you.

336
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,830
I want to be by your side forever.

337
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,830
Yuzu...

338
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,030
Shinya, I love you.

339
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,230
I love you too, Yuzu.

340
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,230
I don't want to be alone anymore, Shinya.

341
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,270
Yuzu.

342
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,670
Does it hurt?

343
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,710
No, I'm just nervous.

344
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,830
Don't worry. Leave everything to me.

345
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,110
Okay.

346
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,470
I'm embarrassed.

347
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,990
Why?

348
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,950
My breasts... are small.

349
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,910
Don't worry.

350
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,830
I want to see them because they're yours.

351
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,150
You're beautiful, Yuzu.

352
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,630
You really mean that?

353
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,070
I got hard just from looking at you.

354
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,990
A-Amazing. I didn't know it could get this big.

355
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,630
It only gets like that when someone I love touches me.

356
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,550
Yuzu!

357
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,510
No... No, stop!

358
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,150
Don't worry, Yuzu.

359
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,190
Shinya...

360
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,550
My body... My body feels strange!

361
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,950
Do you like it?

362
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,390
I don't know. I can't control my body!

363
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,270
I-Incredible!

364
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,870
It's so big.

365
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,590
Don't do it if you don't want to.

366
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,870
Don't worry. I'm a grown woman now.

367
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,350
Shinya, how is it? Does it feel good?

368
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,550
Yes, I love it!

369
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,190
Not it's my turn.

370
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,870
No. Stop.

371
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,430
Relax. I want to see it.

372
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,070
Show me everything.

373
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,750
No, stop it. Don't look at me up close.

374
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,390
You're beautiful, Yuzu. I want to lick you.

375
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,430
No, don't.

376
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:53,550
Shinya, not there! No... Shinya! I... I...

377
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,350
Shinya!

378
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,510
Yuzu, here I go.

379
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,030
Okay.

380
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,670
Are you all right?

381
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,470
I'm fine. Now we are one.

382
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,350
That's right. Can you feel me inside of you?

383
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,870
Yes. I can feel you inside me.

384
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,630
Sh-Shinya. Shinya!

385
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,510
Yuzu!

386
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,230
This is so embarrassing. My body... I'm losing my mind.

387
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,790
Does it feel good?

388
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,870
I don't know.

389
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,150
I can feel you inside me, all the way inside me.

390
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,150
— You're opening me up all the way.

391
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,830
— Yuzu...
— You're opening me up all the way.

392
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,590
Yuzu, I love you! I love you, Yuzu!

393
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,470
I love you too, more than anyone else.

394
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,110
I love you, Shinya!

395
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,510
I can't hold back anymore. Yuzu, I'm cumming!

396
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,550
Yes, cum inside me.

397
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,550
Shinya...

398
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,790
Shinya!

399
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,190
Yuzu!

400
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,430
<i>I can feel Shinya. I can feel him inside me.

401
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,470
Shinya...

402
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,990
Yuzu.

403
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,230
Now I have another memory with you.

404
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,950
Thank you, Shinya.

405
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,470
Yuzu...

406
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,550
So what's the story with her illness?

407
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,590
Well, since then, it hasn't happened again.

408
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,670
The doctor is amazed.

409
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,030
Because her illness has no cure, he said it was like a miracle.

410
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,710
Like a miracle...

411
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,030
Where is he anyway? It's getting late.

412
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,030
Sorry to keep you waiting!

413
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,070
Sorry, sorry.

414
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,830
There was so much snow to shovel that we were delayed.

415
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,870
You're too late, moron!

416
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,510
Hurry up and go to Narumi!

417
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,070
Are you okay, Shinya?

418
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,110
Shinya!

419
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,430
They haven't changed at all.

420
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,310
Maybe...

421
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,710
No, it's nothing.
