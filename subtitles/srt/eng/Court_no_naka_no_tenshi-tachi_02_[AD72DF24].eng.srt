1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,610
<i>We the Volleyball Team at Aota Academy...</i>

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,910
<i>... aim to be victorious</i>
<i>at the City Championship.</i>

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,320
<i>We've got a new player.</i>
<i>Nanase Morimura.</i>

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,750
<i>Sometimes she makes easy mistakes.</i>
<i>Other times she shows incredible talent.</i>

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,820
<i>She's rather mysterious.</i>

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,230
<i>We won the semi-final.</i>

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,360
<i>In the final, we face our rival, O-Ring.</i>

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,870
<i>We should focus on the game, but...</i>

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,500
<i>... we are too distracted</i>
<i>by our coach and Nanase.</i>

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,060
<i>Trouble! It's the Coach!</i>

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,640
<i>It's my fault.</i>
<i>He got attacked by a gang.</i>

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,310
<i>O- Ring is so strong.</i>

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,550
<i>How can we beat them without our coach?</i>

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,490
Angels in the Court

15
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,120
Coach.

16
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,620
<i>Hi, it's Motoura.</i>

17
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,560
<i>Yo, how you've been?</i>
<i>What? I can't hear you.</i>

18
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,820
<i>Oops, sorry, I'm out.</i>

19
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,200
He<i>'</i>s not back yet.

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,500
What can I do?
He was protecting me.

21
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,870
Kozue.

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,040
His cock was out.
He was at a disadvantage.

23
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,950
Maybe the gang beat up
our coach.

24
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,340
- And drowned him?
- No.

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,920
It hurts.

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,020
Natalie

27
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,820
Heaven. I<i>'</i>m in heaven.

28
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,480
Mister, are you rich?

29
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,410
For now.

30
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,490
<i>Sorry, I'm out.</i>

31
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,830
- Not home yet.
- Where<i>'</i>s he gone?

32
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,200
He<i>'</i>ll be all right.

33
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,400
Right, Captain?

34
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,450
There is no point in hanging around.

35
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,490
Coach is fine. Tomorrow is the final.

36
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,390
Let<i>'</i>s go home and sleep.

37
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,070
Coach.

38
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,370
The Championship Final
at O-Ring Academy

39
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,250
They<i>'</i>re in no hurry.

40
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,190
Where is he?

41
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,790
What<i>'</i>s going on?

42
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,840
Kumi Marui

43
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,370
<i>- Kumi?</i>
<i>- Nanase? Where are you?</i>

44
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,880
- Well, I<i>'</i>m at home.
<i>- Come over to O-Ring right away.</i>

45
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,110
<i>- We lost the Coach and my sister.</i>
- What?

46
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,740
<i>We need you. We'll be waiting.</i>
<i>Hey, what're you doing?</i>

47
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,250
<i>If she's not serious,</i>
<i>she'll only be trouble.</i>

48
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,550
<i>Hey, Nao, give it to me.</i>

49
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,160
- Nanase. You<i>'</i>re here.
- Why are you here?

50
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,560
Nao.

51
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,740
- Nanase.
- Nanase.

52
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,710
Morning.

53
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,270
- What time is it?
- Well. Dawn, maybe.

54
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,990
- You have such stamina.
- Do I?

55
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,090
- Yes.
- What time is it?

56
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,200
Morning.

57
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,040
Morning.

58
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,910
Hey, where is Motoura?

59
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,280
You don<i>'</i>t mean to play
without a coach?

60
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,250
Where is Sho Marui?

61
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,580
You don<i>'</i>t need your ace spiker
against us?

62
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,060
- No, what happened was...
- Exactly.

63
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,150
- I see. You got tits.
- You mean, I got guts.

64
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,430
Soon you won<i>'</i>t be able to turn up
your nostrils at us.

65
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,330
- You mean, turn up my nose at you.
- Gosh, you bitch.

66
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,360
Don<i>'</i>t.

67
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,510
Ready for the Lust Judgment.

68
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,100
Last, right?

69
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,440
Motoura

70
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,410
Hey. What time is it?

71
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,320
Hey.

72
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,100
I<i>'</i>m scared.

73
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,000
O-Ring - Aota

74
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,200
No more.

75
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,770
Welcome to <i>Hello, Housewife</i>,
It<i>'</i>s 12:15 pm. I<i>'</i>m your host<i>...</i>

76
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,300
12:15? You gotta be kidding.

77
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,900
What<i>'</i>s wrong?

78
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,570
The game has started.

79
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,010
This is bad. This is bad.

80
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,820
- What am I going to do?
- You don<i>'</i>t have to come to the game?

81
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,050
I have to come, of course.

82
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,040
<i>Back attack.</i>

83
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,490
Give me all you<i>'</i>ve got.
So long as I<i>'</i>m in the front.

84
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,220
You<i>'</i>ve stopped only one.
Nothing to be proud about.

85
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,020
I am proud.

86
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,140
- Nao.
- Nao.

87
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,330
She landed on the ball.

88
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,710
Nao.

89
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,120
Here we are.

90
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,190
You got a fever or something?

91
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,800
Don<i>'</i>t overreact.

92
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,590
I just twisted it a little.

93
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,140
Why don<i>'</i>t you forfeit?

94
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,150
This stupid slut won<i>'</i>t play for a while.
You have no other player.

95
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,150
- This is no way to win, but...
- Not yet.

96
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,960
- Sis!
- Captain!

97
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,200
Sis.

98
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,140
So you<i>'</i>re here. Sho Marui.

99
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,920
What<i>'</i>re you doing?

100
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,190
Fuck, that full monty bastard.

101
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,220
I underestimated him,
because he was full monty.

102
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,770
Next time, we<i>'</i>ll beat him up.

103
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,770
No, kill him.

104
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,780
I<i>'</i>m flying.

105
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,340
No way.

106
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,740
- Sis.
- Captain.

107
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,380
I knew it.

108
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,550
Captain.

109
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,720
This is it.
You only have five left.

110
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,590
What to do?
We<i>'</i>ll end up forfeiting.

111
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,800
I<i>'</i>m in.

112
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,360
Who is she?
Aota<i>'</i>s secret weapon?

113
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,590
I can<i>'</i>t do it.

114
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,980
I told you.

115
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,820
If you<i>'</i>re not serious,
you<i>'</i>re only trouble.

116
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,630
- I<i>'</i>m sorry.
- No more, Nao.

117
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,690
Why, Nanase, why? You<i>'</i>re so good.

118
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,670
Nanase, go away.

119
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,000
- Nao.
- Nao, no.

120
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,130
You can<i>'</i>t. You<i>'</i>re injured.

121
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,540
I<i>'</i>m not the type to get excited.
But I don<i>'</i>t want to lose today.

122
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,940
Nao.

123
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,450
Let<i>'</i>s win for our stupid missing coach!

124
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,280
Nao.

125
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,020
- Sis.
- Captain.

126
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,820
I<i>'</i>ll do it.
I<i>'</i>m sorry about the trouble.

127
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,160
As the captain,
I shouldn<i>'</i>t have stayed out all night...

128
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,170
...Iooking for the coach.

129
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,460
I can do it.

130
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,900
Let<i>'</i>s go.

131
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,280
- Coach.
- Nanase, you?

132
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,590
How<i>'</i>s the game going?

133
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,860
We can still make it.

134
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,070
<i>Nanase needs to be loved.</i>
<i>Only then can she relax.</i>

135
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,670
<i>Only then can she let herself go</i>
<i>and play to her full potential.</i>

136
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,980
Coach.

137
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,860
This is too much.

138
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,400
Okay, let<i>'</i>s go.

139
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,540
Nanase, it<i>'</i>s about time. Hey.

140
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,410
Coach, do it to me.

141
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,820
They<i>'</i>re very good. I need more power.

142
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,190
But...

143
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,960
I want you, Coach. Only you.
It has to be.

144
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,660
Nanase.

145
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,400
O-Ring - Aota

146
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,910
- Coach, I<i>'</i>m scared.
- It<i>'</i>s all right.

147
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,110
My first time, and in this position.
I<i>'</i>m embarrassed.

148
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,310
Does it hurt?

149
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,210
Just a little. But...

150
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,110
...it<i>'</i>s good.

151
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,550
We<i>'</i>ll do it.

152
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,860
Multiple-strike attack.

153
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,840
- Sis.
- I<i>'</i>m sorry, Kumi.

154
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,160
This is not a victory.

155
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,060
We<i>'</i>ve only just begun.

156
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,770
Sho Marui. What a disappointment.

157
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,640
- Sis.
- Captain.

158
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,280
O-One more point.
One more point.

159
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,150
Is this it?

160
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,490
<i>Time out. Time out!</i>

161
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,350
Coach!

162
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,350
Motoura.

163
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,880
Coach.

164
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,550
Coach.

165
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,750
- What have you been doing?
- Where have you been?

166
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,060
- We were so scared.
- Whose bra is this?

167
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,890
Die, die, die.

168
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,430
Hey, hey, hey. You<i>'</i>re so late, stupid.

169
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,640
Who the hell are you?

170
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,400
- Captain.
- Nanase. Good luck.

171
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,330
Substitution!

172
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,960
Let<i>'</i>s go.

173
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,080
There.

174
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,870
- Give it to me.
- O-Here.

175
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,420
Kumi.

176
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,620
She read my ball.

177
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,050
- Nanase.
- Yes.

178
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,300
I never knew about her.

179
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,860
Motoura, is she your secret weapon?

180
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,240
Yeah!

181
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,730
No.

182
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,040
We did it!

183
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,590
We did it!

184
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,760
Infirmary

185
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,690
I<i>'</i>m sorry I made you worry.

186
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,170
You<i>'</i>re awake.

187
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,610
I<i>'</i>m so glad you<i>'</i>re safe.

188
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,310
Next is the National Championship, Sho.

189
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,380
<i>I don't have a single drop left.</i>

190
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:18,020
<i>It's the National Championship next,</i>
<i>Coach!</i>

191
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,020
<i>Yeah.</i>
