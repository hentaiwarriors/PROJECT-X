1
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,490
You've got to be kidding!

2
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,560
Our college has no problems that
warrant an investigation!

3
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,190
There's no need for such frivolity!

4
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,860
It's up to us...

5
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,670
to decide whether it's necessary.

6
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,880
We've received information
that one of your students...

7
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,140
works for an escort service.

8
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,750
Moreover, the clientele
aren't even students.

9
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,090
Even if there were such a problem...

10
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,680
we would address it ourselves!

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,750
We don't want you to come here.

12
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,390
Actually, we're already here.

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,600
What the heck's going on?

14
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,740
I'm with the Special Office of
the Education Committee.

15
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,750
Sara Iijima. At your service!

16
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,610
Sara Iijima is a brilliant
psychotherapist.

17
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,830
She opens the doors to the
souls of troubled students...

18
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,870
and confronts their anxieties.

19
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,840
She probes deep into their insecurities.

20
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,800
To challenge their demons...

21
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,210
she encourages them to
use their own strengths...

22
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,270
so they can understand
and overcome their problems.

23
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,490
Sara uses the psychofeed method...

24
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,450
to help them unlock their true selves.

25
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,630
The lesson is over.

26
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,870
Today, Sara is at a college
with such troubled students.

27
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,880
And together with her
assistant, Tamine...

28
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,980
she'll save the souls of the students.

29
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,780
A student at this reputable college...

30
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,120
prostituting herself for an
escort service! What a shame!

31
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,430
<i>Here she comes! Our Kranke.</i>

32
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,360
<i>Come on, Tamine.
Don't say things like Kranke.</i>

33
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,840
Why not? It's German for patient.

34
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,570
It's the proper term, isn't it?

35
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,570
I just don't like it.

36
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,610
Sorry.

37
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,110
Yuri Saito, freshman at Saint
Sakuragaoka College.

38
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,310
Works for the escort service every day.

39
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,990
Sure is a cutie.

40
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,460
White! Thought so!

41
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,960
What's that supposed to mean?!

42
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,970
Just that white's proper.

43
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,230
She certainly doesn't
seem out of the ordinary.

44
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,670
Hard to believe she's a prostitute.

45
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,230
Appearances can be deceiving
with women these days.

46
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,250
That's strange. That bra's
way too big for her.

47
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,220
It'd be just about
right for you though.

48
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,620
Yup, perfect fit.

49
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,430
Remember what you're here for?

50
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,090
Yes!

51
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,140
Oh no!

52
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,520
Off to work she goes.

53
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,170
Did she do this?!

54
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,450
One... two... three... four...

55
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,950
five... six... seven... eight...

56
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,480
It's so good.

57
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,750
Oh yeah!

58
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,520
Yes! Yes!

59
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,370
That was delicious!

60
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,640
Why would she do it?

61
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,620
She looks so innocent.

62
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,990
Couldn't be for the money.

63
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,520
I wonder why.

64
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,800
What would make her do it?!

65
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,230
Panties!

66
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,140
Sara! Should we go in?

67
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,680
Let's leave that to the police.

68
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,740
I'm more interested in
that incident with the bra.

69
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,840
What could have gotten into her?

70
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,550
Maybe it's her small bust.

71
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,490
She could have a complex.

72
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,320
She's not exactly small.

73
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,960
Couldn't be that.

74
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,400
There must be another reason.

75
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,640
Telling me to come to
the gym, wearing gym clothes...

76
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,840
I'm not into weird fetishes.

77
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,240
Really? Well, sorry.

78
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,280
You're my client?

79
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,110
That's right.

80
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,750
Alright. I don't have
a problem with that.

81
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,750
Let's have fun.

82
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,930
Yes, let's get to know each other.

83
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,620
Deep into our souls.

84
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,370
You really know what you're doing.

85
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,080
No one knows a woman's
body like a woman.

86
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,680
My God!

87
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:05,410
Not there! That's my
most sensitive part!

88
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,250
There's nothing to be
shy about. Just let go.

89
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,150
If you keep licking me so hard...

90
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,060
I don't know what...

91
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,860
You mustn't feel a thing.
Not a thing.

92
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,090
You're a psychotherapist.

93
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,870
You're her counselor.

94
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,970
It feels so good!

95
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,320
This is terrible!

96
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,410
I shouldn't be doing this!

97
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,620
I'm supposed to be helping her!

98
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,430
Sara's taking a long time.

99
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,160
Shouldn't take her that long!

100
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,180
Good. I'll make you cum
over and over again.

101
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,610
How come your breasts are so big?

102
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,380
Know what?

103
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,080
Big breasts like these...

104
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,060
I hate them!

105
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,630
What are you doing?!

106
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,760
Stop it!

107
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,760
I'm gonna slash those big tits of yours!

108
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,380
Sara!

109
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,780
Tamine...

110
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,030
I've done something awful.

111
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,800
Sara! Are you okay?

112
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,840
I've done something awful.

113
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,270
Sure you're alright?

114
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,110
Positive. Don't worry.

115
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,810
Go home.

116
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,250
Okay.

117
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,520
Her eyes told me she
was in need of help.

118
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,200
I lost control.

119
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,100
I was overcome by my feelings.

120
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,900
I'm a failure as a psychotherapist!

121
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,670
How can I have a
crisis in this racket!

122
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,740
What an ungodly hour!

123
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,250
It's Dr. Chang!

124
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,250
Professor! Huh?

125
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,790
Down here!

126
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,790
My beloved student!

127
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,960
Been a long time!

128
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,590
David Chang! We haven't met
since my Ph.D. At Stunford!

129
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,400
I'm here for the international
psychotherapy conference.

130
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,570
Professor, your hand!

131
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,270
Never mind that.

132
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,610
Since I'm here, I thought I'd see
my best student's boobs...

133
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,450
I mean face.

134
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,090
Your "best student"?

135
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,550
I'm afraid I can't live
up to that anymore.

136
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,290
I see.

137
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,530
A great psychotherapist like
you made your first mistake.

138
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,230
I've lost confidence and
I'm thinking of just quitting.

139
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,440
What?!

140
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,170
What are you being so childish for?

141
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,210
You can't worry about
every little mistake you make.

142
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,650
That student's troubles run
much deeper than your own.

143
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,590
And the person to help
her is Sara Iijima!

144
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,690
Only your psychofeed
method can help her now!

145
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,590
Professor...

146
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,590
Think back, Sara.

147
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,760
Remember when you
were studying at Stunford?

148
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,970
Back then, you had
a real breast complex.

149
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,530
You were so pessimistic.

150
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,570
You couldn't reach your full potential.

151
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,710
I helped you overcome that complex.

152
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,310
We used my psychotherapy
method to explore your mind.

153
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,480
Even as a child,
you had large breasts...

154
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,080
and you were almost
raped by a breast fiend.

155
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,060
Fortunately, a policeman
came and saved you.

156
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,300
Before you knew it,
you had subconsciously...

157
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,890
repressed the memory of the assault.

158
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,430
But you were left
with a breast complex.

159
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,450
Thanks to you, I was able
to overcome my complex.

160
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,720
I studied the psychotherapy
methods you developed...

161
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,450
so that I could help others like me.

162
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,150
Think back to that enthusiasm.

163
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,520
Don't think of them as
sick people or patients.

164
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,930
But as individual people.

165
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,660
Yes, Professor!

166
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,500
What's most important is
to confront that person's soul.

167
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,160
You have a certain
compassion with people.

168
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,170
People recognize that in you.

169
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,950
What matters most with our
philosophy is a warm heart.

170
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,540
Yes, Professor.

171
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,410
Right, a warm heart.

172
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,680
Let them feel your heart.

173
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,190
Thank you, Professor!

174
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,990
As long as you understand.

175
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,160
Let's start with the secret of
psychofeed therapy.

176
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,230
What?

177
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,930
The secret?

178
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,560
I thought I was gonna die.

179
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,310
Watch me closely and do as I do.

180
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,090
Right. Close... open... close... open...

181
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,730
Close... open... close... open.

182
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,800
That's right, now open wider!

183
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,730
Professor. Sure you're not
enjoying this too much?

184
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,610
Concentrate! Forget my gaze,
or you won't grasp the secret!

185
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,440
One, two, three, four.

186
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,150
Put your hips into it! Yes, that's it!

187
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,780
Good! Hold it right there!

188

<i>The secret Omote Sando!</i>

189
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,440
You again.

190
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,880
You got it.

191
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,250
This time we can have a good
time and nobody will interrupt.

192
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,080
I thought I told you
I hate breasts like yours.

193
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,710
Doesn't matter.
I can't forget your technique.

194
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,720
Do it to me again,
just the same way.

195
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,120
Only this time, forget the Exacto knife.

196
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,140
Alright. I'll give you the full
treatment this time.

197
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,340
Follow me.

198
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,110
In here.

199
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,450
No one will bother us here.

200
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,450
This is well thought-out.

201
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,410
Hurry!

202
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,860
That's good!

203
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, that's good!

204
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,310
I can't let her get to me!

<i>The secret Omote Sando psychofeed

206
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,420
Feel the sexual energy from my body!

207
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,200
Okay Yuri.

208
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,930
Now it's my turn to give you pleasure.

209
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,370
That feels so good.

210
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,550
I've never felt this way before.

211
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,530
Oh my God!

212
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,330
This is the moment for my psychotherapy.

213
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,270
Yuri, why do you hate big breasts?

214
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,050
Nobody likes me because
my breasts are small.

215
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,880
Everybody hates me.

216
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,390
Nobody hates you.

217
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,850
Besides, your breasts aren't small.

218
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,330
They are. That's why they hate me.

219
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,770
Large breasts are a symbol of maternity.

220
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,270
You must have been traumatized.

221
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,280
We're going back in time now, Yuri.

222
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,040
How old are you, Yuri?

223
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,600
Three.

224
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,480
Daddy, you promised
to take me to Playland.

225
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,960
Sorry, Yuri. I have to work today.

226
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,890
It's Parents Day at kindergarten today.

227
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,400
You're coming, right?

228
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,370
I have to work today. Sorry Yuri.

229
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,270
Daddy hates me.

230
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,340
He doesn't think I'm pretty.

231
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,740
Or is it because I killed my mommy?

232
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,480
She didn't receive enough
love when she was a child.

233
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,480
She subconsciously blames
herself for her mother's death.

234
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,030
That's why she feels she's hated.

235
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,630
Her disdain for large
breasts is actually...

236
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,330
an expression of the feelings
for the mother that left her.

237
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,940
She prostitutes herself as punishment...

238
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,840
in an act of self-destruction.

239
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,670
By getting strangers to
show her physical love...

240
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,550
she tries to make up for
the lost love of her parents.

241
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,220
Yuri, your mother died
because she was sick.

242
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,150
You didn't kill her.

243
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,520
And your father doesn't hate you.

244
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,550
When your mom died, he was
so upset he couldn't think.

245
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,600
You're wrong!

246
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,030
Both your parents loved you
when you were born.

247
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,540
There are no parents
who don't love their children.

248
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,830
You should know that.

249
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,610
What a cutie!

250
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,020
Hi sweetheart!

251
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,960
I'm your mommy!
You're finally here!

252
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,190
I'm so glad!

253
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,260
I'm so glad you're here!

254
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,070
We love you so much!
More than anyone!

255
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:11,070
You're my jewel!
You're our precious little jewel.

256
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,640
See Yuri?

257
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,050
Remember how blessed you
were when you were born?

258
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,050
Mommy.

259
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,750
Thank you mommy and daddy!

260
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,030
The lesson is over.

261
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,830
Those are expensive.
Sure you wanna do that?

262
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,260
I'm sure. I don't need it.

263
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,270
What?

264
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,500
You have such big breasts.

265
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,380
Sorry.

266
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,240
I love women with large breasts.

267
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,250
Uh, have we met before?

268
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,740
No.

269
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,010
Well, goodbye.

270
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,120
She doesn't seem to remember you.

271
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,900
I erased her memory of me.

272
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,160
That reminds me. How about
we teach that Dean a lesson?

273
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,360
Good idea.

274
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm telling you to do whatever it takes!

275
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
I just want you to get rid of those two!

276
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,710
I'm running this college to make money!

277
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,310
If word gets out, this college
will lose its standing!

278
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,320
I just got all of that on tape!

279
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,380
You're a failure as an educator!

280
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,760
I suggest you submit
your resignation, Dean.

281
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,250
Wait!

282
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,960
See you!

283
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,230
I'll change my ways!
Don't tell anyone about this!

284
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,410
I'll pay anything! How much?

285
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,670
How much do you want?

286
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,440
My, my! That Dean never gives up!

287
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,450
This is what I think of people like him.

288
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,550
Here goes.

289
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,300
Oh, that feels good! I'm coming!

290
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,240
On to the next job!

291
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,280
Oh no! I'll have to explain this.

292
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,080
She did it again! My best disciple!
