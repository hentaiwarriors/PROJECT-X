try to set the mood more?

172
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,910
You know what I mean...

173
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,209
Shut up!

174
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,400
How is it going? Are you
going to finish in time?

175
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,070
Oh, Miss Ebizuka.

176
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,170
I just have to put these menus
on the tables, and we're done.

177
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,845
I see, so you made it, somehow.

178
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,543
Hosokawa and Kasumi stayed so...

179
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,379
That's good.

180
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,450
Yes.

181
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,228
I love you, Narifumi.

182
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,557
Kasumi.

183
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,561
So please, will you...

184
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,508
Kasumi, I...

185
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,712
You don't like me?

186
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,407
That's...

187
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,780
That's not it.

188
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,657
What's wrong, Kasumi?

189
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,749
Kasumi, what's wrong?

190
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,653
Who is it?

191
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,172
Shizuku.

192
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,246
It took you long enough.

193
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,138
What are you doing?

194
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,478
Can't you tell?

195
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,075
I'm going through the gate.

196
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,346
What are you saying?

197
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,115
I need power.

198
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,322
You don't get it, I'm sure.

199
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,864
Goodbye, Sister.

200
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,194
Shizuku!

201
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,198
What the...

202
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,752
What happened?

203
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,082
Shizuku...

204
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,354
Shizuku...

205
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,396
It can't be...

206
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,760
We have to get in
contact with the Elders.

207
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:26,937
Wait!

208
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,066
Let's go after her.

209
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,235
What are they doing?

210
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,437
What is that?

211
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,451
I know you haven't forgotten.

212
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,578
It's forbidden to go to the other side.

213
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,521
But maybe we can still catch up to her.

214
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,559
And once we catch up to her, then what
are we going to do? Bring her back?

215
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:52,427
The fact that she broke
the rules won't change.

216
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:58,567
But we're the only
ones who know about it.

217
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,168
What are you saying, Miharu?

218
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,374
The true heir to the
Kanomori lineage is Kasumi.

219
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:09,540
The destiny of the branch families of the
Kanomori is to follow Kasumi's orders.

220
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,114
We don't have the right to complain.

221
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,412
That's right.

222
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,916
I'm not taking responsibility for this.

223
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,888
What are they talking about?

224
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,857
So, Kasumi!

225
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:21,683
Kasumi!

226
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,115
Kasumi!

227
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,422
Narifumi?

228
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,331
No! Don't break your concentration!

229
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:40,831
Earthquake?

230
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,242
It's out of control.

231
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:53,882
No!

232
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,490
What is this?

233
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,023
Narifumi...

234
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,797
What is this place?

235
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:40,887
Watch out!

236
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,834
W-What is this?

237
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,301
What's that?

238
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,816
Who are these people?

239
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,475
Our welcoming committee, but I
don't think they're happy to see us.

240
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,549
Let's go back.

241
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,246
What about Shizuku?

242
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,963
What the hell is going on?

243
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:23,932
I'm sorry, Narifumi.

244
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,074
It's all my fault.

245
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,041
What?

246
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:34,279
There's no time to explain right
now, it should be safe here.

247
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,386
I have to get back to everyone.

248
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:37,854
Kasumi.

249
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,557
She's so fast.

250
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,928
Was that really Kasumi?

251
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,686
Who are you?

252
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,983
Do you want to save the others
who are fighting out there?

253
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:25,163
I have the power...

254
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,757
Power?

255
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:30,460
If you want the power, do as I say.

256
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,389
Seek...

257
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:02,593
If you do, then I will give
you the power to rule the world.

258
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:06,568
If you are worthy of it.

259
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,178
Yes, that's it.

260
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,761
Yes, harder.

261
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,767
Faster.

262
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,834
Yes! It feels good!

263
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,571
I'm coming!

264
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,967
I'm coming!

265
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,846
Release your essence!

266
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:14,971
Why am I naked?

267
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,805
Who are you?

268
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:28,776
Who are you?

269
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,856
What is going on?

270
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,921
Someone tell me.
