1
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,140
I'm worried about you.

2
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,020
It'll be fine. I'll finish my mission like I'm supposed to.

3
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,440
I hope so.

4
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,330
Well, I should go now.

5
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,420
Be careful.

6
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,720
The human world is a tougher place than you think.

7
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,380
Thank you, Sadina.

8
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,850
Oh, by the way, tell my mom that...

9
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,110
You stupid girl!

10
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,770
You shouldn't turn around when you're that close to it!

11
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,670

Trouble Evocation

13
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,400
Shuuya-kun, do you believe in magic?

14
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,740
Magic?

15
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,910
I'm already under your spell.

16
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:06,830
Rei-san, your beauty is the magic you used to take my heart hostage.

17
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,920
Since the first time I saw you at the university library, I...

18
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,790
I'm so happy.

19
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,340
I wasn't expecting you to say that.

20
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,560
Rei-san!

21
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,690
There's nothing to be afraid of.

22
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,610
I'll show you a whole new world.

23
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,120
You're so mean!

24
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,250
I thought you were the type who'd accept a guy like me.

25
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,600
One Month Later

26
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,860
Wh-Who are you?!

27
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,110
How did you get in here?!

28
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,620
Nice to meet you. I'm a devil named Ria.

29
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,540
I'm sorry I'm a month late.

30
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,580
A month late? A devil?

31
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,500
Yes, that's right!

32
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,510
Right, right, right, right. Get out of here.

33
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,140
I'm not into weird cults like that.

34
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,020
You've got it all wrong. I'm the real thing.

35
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,690
Didn't you summon a devil a month ago?

36
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,920
Now that you mention it, I did do a summoning a month ago.

37
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,590
I was just trying to follow along as I was reading my old man's books.

38
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,340
Did I do it right?

39
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,680
Did you finally remember?

40
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,810
Although a little late, I'm here to grant you three wishes.

41
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,770
Thanks, but I don't care any more.

42
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,730
<i>I don't care anymore. I don't care anymore.</i>

43
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,730
<i>I don't care anymore.</i>

44
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,070
And that's how it is.

45
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,950
Please, now that you've summoned me, I can't leave until you tell me your three wishes!

46
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,830
Come on, you had to have wanted something if you summoned a devil.

47
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,630
Get out of here!

48
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,380
I'll grant any wish you desire!

49
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,140
I don't need that wish to be made anymore, so leave me alone.

50
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,640
So you had a wish after all!

51
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,140
Please tell me what it was.

52
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,600
I'll make sure it comes true.

53
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,820
I wanted to go out with a certain girl.

54
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,910
But it turns out that girl was actually a guy.

55
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,880
There's nothing to be afraid of.

56
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,750
I'll show you a whole new world.

57
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,850
So now you can see why I don't need that wish any more.

58
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,230
Sorry to disappoint you.

59
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,530
H-Hey!

60
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,780
You're so mean!

61
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,570
You summoned this poor little devil,

62
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,160
and now that I'm finally here, you're just sending me away?

63
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,240
I-It's nothing to cry about.

64
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,290
You're terrible!

65
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,040
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

66
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,090
What kind of place sends out a devil a whole month after it's been summoned?

67
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,510
It's obvious that people will change their minds if that much time passes.

68
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,970
I'm sorry!

69
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,970
Please!

70
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,850
I can't go back to the demon world until I've completed my mission!

71
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,350
That's not my problem!

72
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,730
I'm not wasting my soul over something like that!

73
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,490
I'll grant you any wish at all!

74
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,200
Shut up. Go home.

75

Are you telling the truth?

77
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,880
Can you really grant any wish?

78
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,340
Yes!

79
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,340
In that case, become my servant.

80
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,930
What?!

81
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,800
You said you'd grant anything!

82
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,180
But I don't wanna do that.

83
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,600
Oh, really? Well, then...

84
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,100
W-Well, then?

85
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,860
First, summon the Archangel Michael!

86
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,450
Second, summon Lucifer!

87
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,630
And third, make them dance cheek to cheek!

88
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,230
Go ahead and grant those right now.

89
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,690
I can't do that. I'm sorry!

90
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,280
Well, you can't do what you can't do.

91
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,120
Then it seems you'll have to go.

92
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,740
See ya. Bye bye.

93
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,120
I understand.

94
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,390
Wh-What are you doing?

95
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,440
We demons have a special custom to make a contract with a new master.

96
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,570
Really, you don't have to...

103

All right.

104
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,950
Amazing.

105

Amazing.

106
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,460

00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,510
Hurry up and say it!

167
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,260
Ria.

168
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,100
<i>Wh-What's going on!? What am I saying!?</i>

169
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,560
It feels... so good...

170
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,690
This is my second wish.

171
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,980
<i>Shit!</i>

172
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,710
My contract with you...

173
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,460
<i>S-Stop!</i>

174
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,050
What's taking so long?

175
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,930
Hurry up and nullify the contract!

176
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,970
I nullify... my contract...

177
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,410
You were amazing today.

178
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,130
Master!

179
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,470
So that charred newt I ate increased my libido,

180
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,890
and by absorbing that libido you were able to use magic?

181
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,400
I'm very sorry.

182
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,360
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

183
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,570
But...

184
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,200
You stopped me just in time.

185
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,780
And besides, this means...

186
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,330
you've leveled up!

187
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,870
Ria learned the lightning strike!

188
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,750
Or something like that.

189
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,920
Stop it already.

190
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,210
Don't be embarrassed.

191
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,680
I wanted this to end peacefully, but I guess it can't be helped.

192
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,800

196

[I've already graduated from that long ago.]

197
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:33,790

[Don't laugh at me so exaggeratedly,]

198

204

205
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:17,170

[No one will be able to stop this passion.]
