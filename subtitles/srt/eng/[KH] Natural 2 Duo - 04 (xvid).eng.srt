1
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,300
Hurry! Hurry!

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,100
Hey! Hey! Wait a minuite!

3
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,940
This way! This way!

4
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,280
Teacher! Teacher! Hurry up!

5
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,820
Nagahashi-sensei!

6
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,160
Ezaki Hinami, what are you photographing?

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,090
A picture for the schooI newspaper of a student-teacher standing in a fieId of sunflowers!

8
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,340
That's nice...

9
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,340
l can see your panties.

10
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,670
What?

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,300
Yaaaaah!

12
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,760
Obscene, dirty, sex-crazed, pervert teacher!

13
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,040
What are you grinning about?

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,130
Nothing...

15
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,630
Where's Sakaguchi-san?

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,840
The desk editor isn't here.

17
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,550
Huh?

18
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,930
His bad back laid him up.

19
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,890
A bad back?

20
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,520
So... Senpai, please go out with me.

21
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,400
Go out with you?

22
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,530
It's for research! research!

23
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,160
That was hard work.

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,880
Senpai, you're getting old.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,720
Why the hell, do I have to be in charge of a project Iike ''Best Date Spots"?

26
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,220
It's just until the desk editor's back is better.

27
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,430
Until then, you get to go on dates with the beauty of this century.

28
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,890
And, the company pays for it all!

29
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,480
You should consider yourself lucky!

30
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,860
Dummy, l'm going home.

31
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,950
Wait! Senpai! There's still one location left!

32
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,410
There's more?

33
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,160
Yes!

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,590
Um... the climax of the date is a "petite hotel".

35
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,460
What the heIl is that?

36
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,710
It's what they call a love hotel.

37
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,720
For Senpai, the pIayboy, it should be a great pIace!

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,480
Owww! The least you couId do is to make a sarcastic comment before you hit!

39
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,150
So, this means what? That you're going with me to a love hotel?

40
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,540
Well, of course, it's understandable that an over-sexed man like you...

41
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,540
wouldn't be able to control yourseIf

42
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,790
if you went to a love hotel with a super cute and sexy woman Iike me.

43
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,300
But! This is research! research!

44
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,760
Huh?

45
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,050
Forget the super cute, and let's finish this.

46
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,180
But, I don't want you to forget...

47
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,850
Waaah! Senpai, take a look!

48
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,780
Hey, why did you pay to get in here?

49
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,740
You got permission to use this for the story, right?

50
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:09,200
WeII, that is... it's what's known as a undercover report.

51
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,160
Dummy.

52
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,500
There's no point to getting in here undercover.

53
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,340
What are you planning?

54
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,090
Planning? Noway!

55
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,010
Is that right? Well, go ahead and finish this yourself.

56
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,480
Aaaaah! Wait, Senpai!

57
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,310
Give me a reason.

58
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,900
Um... Well, I thought a place like this might get you in the mood.

59
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,450
Huh? In the mood?

60
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,580
A lady can't just say "seduce me".

61
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,160
You just did.

62
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,790
l-l've played around a lot, too, you know!

63
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,790
This is nothing!

64
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,340
But, I wanted you to feel important so...

65
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,510
Waaaaah! Senpai!

66
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,760
Wait!

67
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,760
Then let's do it, Hina-the-pIaygirl...!

68
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,810
You're beautiful, Hinami.

69
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,230
Trust me, and reIax, okay?

70
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,860
Thank you Senpai, l'm really happy.

71
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,610
l am, too. l was waiting for this day.

72
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,170
That's a nice pose, Hina-chan.

73
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,880
ls this what lovers do together?

74
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,220
I didn't know...

75
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,930
WeII, damn, you want to quit already?

76
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,230
l'm perfectly fine! l've done this a million times.

77
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,650
That aside, you're covered in that stuff.

78
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,700
Senpai, you really are nice.

79
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,450
I almost believed you weren't.

80
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,990
Hmm...?

81
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,330
There you go!

82
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,460
Senpai, you're terrible!

83
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,170
Am I?

84
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,010
Please be more considerate.

85
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,390
What are you doing?!

86
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,140
I'm going to shave this damn hair. lt doesn't suit you.

87
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,270
What? Oh, no...

88
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,900
Don't move, or something important might get cut.

89
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,990
Oh? Did you like that?

90
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,240
No! That's not it!

91
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,240
Aaah! My hair...

92
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,500
l can see everything.

93
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,500
It's nothing to Iaugh about. It's too embarassing...

94
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:15,090
Now. Even if you've played around, l bet you've never had this inside you.

95
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,930
Of course, not! Please, turn off the microphone!

96
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,020
But, you're making some good sounds.

97
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,980
Now, I'm putting it in.

98
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,860
Hey! Wait! Time-out!

99
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,490
Ah! Wait Senpai! l'm sorry! l'm sorry!

100
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,040
What is it Hina-the-playgirl?

101
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,660
You already know!

102
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,710
Know what?

103
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,380
It's my first time to have sex.

104
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,880
You should have said that from the start, you and your stupid pride.

105
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:58,970
I'm sorry! I thought if l said I'd played around, it wouId be Iess pressure on you.

106
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,350
lts all the same to me.

107
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,600
You're a brute! A heartIess beast! You're going to rape a virgin like it's nothing?!

108
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,560
Who asked who out?

109
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,730
I did...

110
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,280
It hurts!

111
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:29,380
l didn't know it hurt this much! It was a mistake in my pIan...!

112
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,100
They will see you soon

113
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,270
This coffee is coId.

114
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,230
l'm sorry, I'II bring you another!

115
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,900
She's kind of nasty...

116
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,150
Hinami. Did a writer recommended by Professor Akiyama, come by?

117
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,910
Senpai!

118
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,780
lt's been a long time, Shouma.

119
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,750
Ayane! Why is she here?

120
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,500
Oh, didn't you know? Right now, l'm an assistant for Professor Akiyama.

121
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,680
Senpai! ln a place Iike this?!

122
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,100
A place like this can be a turn on, too.

123
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,520
You're a real sex maniac.

124
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,520
Your mouth isn't working.

125
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,040
You're easily aroused.

126
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,710
How would l know when l was aIone?

127
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,300
I'm cuming!

128
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,730
Drink it all.

129
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,940
Good girl. l'll give you a IittIe extra.

130
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,900
Huh?

131
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,460
I can't believe you were a virgin untiI just the other day.

132
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,300
l'm embarassed.

133
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,420
Looks like youre grooming yourself down there.

134
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,420
I'II give you a prize.

135
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,340
Yes, please.

136
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,930
It's stiIl tight.

137
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,600
ln time, it will be perfectly my size.

138
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,980
That makes me happy.

139
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,320
Ayane, what are you thinking?

140
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,110
But, people dont change Shouma...

141
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,660
You are the same as before.

142
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,580
The reaI character of a person can't change.

143
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,000
You can't Iove another person.

144
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:15,960
Shut up!

145
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,630
Because you can't trust anyone.

146
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,510
Shut upl You whore!

147
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,590
W-wait!

148
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,440
AII you're good for is a hole!

149
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,900
That's mean.

150
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,790
I don't want to. PIease, no more!

151
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,930
Shit! Shit!

152
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,360
Shit! Shit! Shit!

153
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,990
I can't hold back anymore, cum inside me, cum inside me please!

154
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:00,730
That's why the Japanese music world must continue to change.

155
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,900
Will that do?

156
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,870
Thank you. lt should make a good story.

157
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,960
And, the photos are great, too! Looking like a nice intelIigent oIder man type.

158
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,210
Make a quick withdraw.

159
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,800
Yes, sir!

160
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,970
By the way, Narahashi-kun. Can I have a IittIe of your time?

161
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:34,930
Yes?

162
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,930
l have something l want to ask you.

163
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,530
Huh. Aren't you Ezaki-san? What are you doing?

164
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,540
Shibazaki-sensai...

165
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,370
Me? But that is...

166
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,290
I think this is a good opportunity for you.

167
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,710
How about it?

168
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,300
Please, give me time to think about it.

169
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,050
There's not a Iot of time. I hope you'lI give me a good answer.

170
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,350
Excuse me...

171
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,810
What?

172
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,110
Why are you still here?

173
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,530
No reason I was bored.

174
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,120
She was supposed to become my sister.

175
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,370
Supposed to?

176
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,920
My mother and her father were going to get married...

177
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,130
but in the end, it didn't get as far as marriage...

178
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,510
How about you? What are you doing?

179
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,350
I'm waiting for Senpai.

180
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,060
That's his sister.

181
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,360
Looks Iike you were dumped.

182
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,860
What are you saying?!

183
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,370
I work under him, so I can't just leave without him.

184
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,740
That's why l will always...

185
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,580
Since both of us got dumped, why don't we go have a drink?

186
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,080
That why I said...

187
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,000
Both of us got dumped...?

188
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,260
Probably, Shouma is going to America

189
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:45,940
Don't call him "Shouma'' like that! You don't know him!

190
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,690
His kindness is just a mask to hide his true seIf.

191
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,320
The reaI Shouma is not kind at all.

192
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,950
PIease, don't do anymore, Shouma...

193
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,170
l leave you tied up for onIy one day, and you're aIready begging.

194
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,460
You just pissed where you sat... It's perfect for a whore Iike you...

195
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:20,310
Don't say that. l was bad, Master Shouma. Please touch me kindIy...

196
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,810
What a sight, you whore. I'm gonna do you thoroughly!

197
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,030
Why are you acting all cool at an Oden shop?

198
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,570
Senpai is always mean to me, and enjoys it.

199
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:42,750
He's not the least kind... But, that's really...

200
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,130
is way of showing his love for me, Not!

201
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,800
She can't hold her liquor.

202
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,640
What about the beautiful sister...

203
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:13,480
No way he's leaving his cute little Hina alone and going to America.

204
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,400
You don't know anything, do you?

205
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,200
Hmmm... if you look closely, she's actually kind of pretty.

206
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,680
Huh? Shibazaki-sensai...

207
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,260
Stay still, and l'll make you feel good.

208
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,760
Good?

209
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,200
That tickles!

210
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,990
Hmmm... ls that the way it is?

211
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,120
l've thought of an interesting idea, Shouma.

212
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,130
But, it was a relief that it wasn't so bad.

213
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,510
lt is so bad. l have to stay for a week.

214
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,050
But, since you're here, Iets have them check you completely, okay?

215
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,390
Kuu, you're mean.

216
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,850
Nii-sama...!

217
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,020
Huh?

218
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,190
They want somebody over there.

219
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,030
l wanted to recommend you, who was one of my top students.

220
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,910
For you to stay in Japan not using your talents is a waste for the entire music world.

221
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,720
Ahhh! I'm finaIIy home!

222
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,640
I'm home again, front door!

223
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,060
She's over doing it.

224
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,100
lt can't be heIped. She was supposed to be gone a week, but it turned into a month.

225
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,020
It was to be expected when the test resuIts were bad.

226
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,740
Anyway, Chi-chan is better, so tonight we'll celebrate with a party!

227
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:34,230
America? At least a year? Nii-sama just came home. l don't want him to go...!

228
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,610
Last night, Chisato was reaIIy excited.

229
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,400
Yeah

230
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,740
What's the matter?

231
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,400
You saw us Iast night, didn't you?

232
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,420
You've turned into a bitch in heat, Kuu.

233
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,750
Don't say that...

234
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,090
You've completely turned into my bitch.

235
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,670
lts so embarassing.

236
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,170
Hinami! What's the meaning of this?!

237
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,850
You've caIIed in sick for two weeks! That devil of a desk editor made me do your work!

238
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,150
How fierce! Sounds like you really like this girl.

239
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Ayane...!

240
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,620
l'm cuming! l'm cuming! l'm cuming! I'm cuming...!

241
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,810
Ayane! What are you doing here?!

242
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,640
Just what it looks like.

243
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,190
The same thing you're aIways doing.

244
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,320
That hurt...!

245
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,070
I dont know what you're thinking, but stay away from Hinami!

246
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,030
That's rich, coming from you!

247
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,990
Shut up!

248
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,340
Don't ever come here again. Understand?!

249
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,800
Egotist...

250
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,560
Wow... You must be really good at photography.

251
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,220
That's a manual camera, isn't it?

252
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,230
Ah! Can you teII?

253
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:25,270
That's a good angle, and you've framed it weIl. Ezaki, you may have taIent.

254
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,360
Hinami... Hinami...!

255
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,410
Wake up. Hinami...

256
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,790
Senpai...

257
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,170
Shouma... People can't change their true selves.

258
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,420
Neither you... or l...

259
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,520
Yeah, I remember now.

260
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:06,480
Yes... The reason l became a photographer was because you praised me.

261
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:12,110
Of course, since it was my first love who paised me, I was traumatized.

262
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,830
Do you know the correct meaning of trauma?

263
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,330
Did l make a mistake? Wait, don't you feel something at the "first love" part?

264
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,500
Not really.

265
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,630
This man is my first love, l have the worst luck.

266
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,850
l'm thinking of going to America.

267
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,650
Senpai is making Iove to me tenderly...

268
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,650
Tenderly for the first time...

269
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,910
Senpai...

270
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Senpai...

271
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,830
Senpai...

272
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,580
From now on, where ever he might go

273
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,340
or what ever might become of him, I have

274
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
and l will always

275
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,010
No matter what, Senpai will...
