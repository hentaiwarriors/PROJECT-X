1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:02,768
It is a turbulent age of war...

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,637
A man has nothing to rely
on but his own skills.

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:10,065
And only by using those skills to
the utmost can he hope to survive!

4
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:48,781
That's amazing...

5
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,146
I can't believe how delicious this is!

6
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:59,516
There's no need to hurry,
I'm not going anywhere.

7
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,287
But you're so popular...

8
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,431
I have no way of knowing
when you'll come see me next.

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,261
Well, since the war's been going on...

10
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,566
...I have more and more widows
like you to tend to, that I do.

11
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,195
It really can't be helped.

12
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,983
That's amazing!

13
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,155
L-I can't take it anymore!

14
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,163
That's a lot for you to shoot out.

15
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,164
But I don't want this
to be over already!

16
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,634
Never fear.

17
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,208
Haven't heard the rumors about me?

18
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,345
"Matagoro the Stallion"...

19
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,177
...and "Matagoro the
Bottomless Reservoir"!

20
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,462
L-It's huge!

21
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,949
You're going to smash me to pieces!

22
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:36,880
Not to worry.

23
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,027
This thing of mine is
nothing compared to a newborn!

24
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,667
My husband was killed before I
had the chance to get pregnant...

25
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,793
...so I don't know about that.

26
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,571
I am so sorry, that I am.

27
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,837
I shouldn't have said that.

28
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,580
It's all right...

29
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,780
If my husband were still alive, I
wouldn't be having such a good time now!

30
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,521
So please, I want you
to thrust even harder!

31
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,586
Just pound me to smithereens,
and make me forget everything!

32
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,724
T-That's amazing!

33
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,061
I'm in heaven!

34
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:24,537
Not yet...

35
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,405
I don't know what's happening to me!
Not yet...

36
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,599
I don't know what's happening to me!

37
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,168
Not yet!

38
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,609
I feel like I'm burning up inside!

39
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,246
I feel amazing too!

40
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,898
It's like a stallion's,
it's so big and hard!

41
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,803
And it's all the way
inside me, hitting my spot!

42
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,573
You are wonderful.

43
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,576
You are such a beautiful
woman.

44
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,839
That makes me happy!

45
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:13,848
That feels great!

46
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:14,851
I want more!

47
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,149
I want more! More!

48
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,249
Whatever you wish!

49
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,194
That feels so good!

50
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,320
I'm coming, I'm coming!

51
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,124
I'm coming...

52
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,161
I'm going to come!

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,468
Can't take it anymore,
I'm going to come!

54
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,626
Then let us come together!

55
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,704
Please, come!

56
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,296
Who the hell are you?

57
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,801
Filthy wretch, don't come near me!

58
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,697
Please, I need to see
Lord Akiyama right away...

59
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:32,363
According to my spy,
there's treasure in Takigawa...

60
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,398
...buried for generations...

61
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,169
If that's the hidden goldmine
we've heard so much about...

62
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,435
...it might bring an end
to our long-standing war.

63
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,710
But how much truth is
there to this information?

64
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:49,543
With your spy now dead, we have
no way of verifying his story...

65
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,977
He said that the tattoos of...

66
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,781
...certain female ninjas would
form the map of the treasure.

67
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,151
It's too preposterous for words!

68
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,225
Not only that, but he also said that
the only time these tattoos were...

69
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,692
...even visible was
when the women climaxed!

70
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:07,755
Are we supposed to believe
such a ridiculous story?

71
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:18,672
Wait!

72
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,644
I've heard that it was a trick
devised by Muhousai Tenni...

73
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,410
Sir!

74
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,247
If a monster like Muhousai
is behind all this...

75
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,483
...we can't very well
dismiss it as a fabrication...

76
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:39,221
My lord, Muhousai died 150 years ago.

77
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,766
I would caution you against
sending forth troops based on...

78
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,531
...unreliable intelligence, especially
at such a time of financial strife.

79
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,336
I see...

80
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,532
Sir, if I may...

81
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,340
What is it?

82
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,239
Lord Akiyama, I have an idea.

83
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,211
I ask that you leave this matter to me.

84
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,518
Stop!

85
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,886
Come back here!

86
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,587
Hey, I said come back!

87
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,863
All right. Leave Sayo alone.

88
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,864
I'll take you all on!

89
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,864
You think you can beat us
crouched over like that?

90
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,129
Who do you think you are, anyway?

91
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,274
Bring it on!

92
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,173
You asked for it!

93
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,259
Big Brother, help me!

94
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,794
Help!

95
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:51,560
Father...

96
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,004
What do you want from me at this late
hour?

97
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:59,471
There's a job that no
one else but you can do!

98
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:05,615
All my life you've said I was a
failure both as a scholar and a warrior...

99
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,352
There's no job in the world that
your bumbling son could accomplish!

100
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,544
Actually, there is!

101
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,251
We Yoshimuras have long
been regarded as outcasts...

102
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,328
...but this is the chance of a lifetime!

103
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,694
If we do this right, it might even give
us the opportunity to bring in a bride.

104
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,321
Huh?

105
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,626
Tomorrow morning at first light,
you must head for Takigawa!

106
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,899
That's ridiculous!

107
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,632
I'll be killed with one stroke
by the first enemy I run into.

108
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,941
And besides, why does it have to be me?

109
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,080
Well, son...

110
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,582
Father, are you serious?

111
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,860
Well, I suppose I am the ideal
man for the job.

112
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,497
Even so...

113
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,034
Listen, Matagoro.

114
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,964
I'm pretty sure that
Sayo is in Takigawa...

115
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,103
Sayo!

116
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,066
While you're fulfilling
your mission there...

117
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,508
...you might be able to
find out something about her.

118
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,107
It's been ten years since
those enemy spies kidnapped her.

119
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,184
If you're going to look for her, this
might be your last chance to do it...

120
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,519
Sayo is my younger sister.

121
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:25,492
But since she was adopted from distant
relatives, we're not related by blood.

122
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,200
Even so, we had a relationship far
stronger than that of brother and sister.

123
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,540
Nobody doubted that someday...

124
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,445
...she and I would marry and take
over as head of the Yoshimura clan.

125
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,525
Big Brother, help me!

126
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,860
Sayo, I'm coming right now!

127
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,768
Big Brother!

128
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,839
You're safe now!

129
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,038
Big Brother?

130
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:11,768
What?

131
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:17,273
Big Brother, will you always
be there when I'm in danger?

132
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,049
Of course, I'm going to protect you
for the rest of my life, that I am.

133
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,142
I promise!

134
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,556
Of course, that's assuming
Sayo is still alive, of course...

135
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,794
Sayo is still alive.

136
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,862
I know she's still alive!

137
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,896
Matagoro...

138
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,594
I can't make any
promises about my mission...

139
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,402
...but I'm going to find
Sayo no matter what it takes!

140
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,845
And with those words, I shared
a farewell drink with my father.

141
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,122
I should have crossed the border by now.

142
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,988
According to our spy, there
should be a female ninja...

143
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,293
...around here somewhere on guard...

144
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,012
Okay, where did she go?

145
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,858
Hmm, what a piece of...

146
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,394
Uh, I wasn't peeping.

147
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,498
Oh yes you were!

148
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,537
You don't look like a
member of the Takigawa clan.

149
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,041
But why are you cutting through the
woods instead of taking the pass?

150
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,045
Oh, I just lost my way, that I did.

151
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,275
You have no reason to suspect me!

152
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,680
Here, I'll prove it...

153
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:06,742
See?

154
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,748
I don't understand...

155
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,983
You're far too much
of a wimp to be a spy!

156
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,495
L-I told you already! I'm not a spy!

157
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,298
Then who are you?

158
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,795
Where did you come from?

159
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:28,473
Um, before I tell you, is there any way
you could put down that horrible sword?

160
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:32,005
L-I'm trembling, I couldn't
talk if I wanted to!

161
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,246
Enough, lame-ass!

162
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,510
I usually just get rid of
suspicious characters like you.

163
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,378
Die!

164
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,452
Such magnificent breasts!

165
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,283
You fool!

166
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,633
So you're burning with desire
even as you're about to die!

167
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,098
Oh my, how embarrassing!

168
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,136
I should've made sure I
tightened my loincloth!

169
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,937
But is it supposed to get like this?

170
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,780
W-What is this?

171
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,388
P-Please, forgive me!

172
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,988
Got her! Now I'm in control!

173
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:41,371
On second thought, it would be too pitiful
for you to end your life so abruptly.

174
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,614
As a parting gift, let me indulge you!

175
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,663
I can't believe there's still so much
left when you're all the way inside!

176
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,726
That feels so good!

177
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,965
I knew you weren't just anyone!

178
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,038
Yes!

179
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,869
Oh really, it's nothing special...

180
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,117
M-My God!

181
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,196
I have endured the
most Spartan training...

182
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,893
...and here I am, wrestled to
the ground by a man like this...

183
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:41,269
As long as it makes you feel good,
there are no winners or losers!

184
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,171
It's hot!

185
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,767
I feel as though I'm going to
burst into flames any second!

186
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,814
This fire is going to melt me away!

187
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,745
Amazing...

188
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,820
Unbelievable!

189
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,117
Unbelievable!

190
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,276
I can't take it anymore!
I'm going to come!

191
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,109
I'm going to come now...

192
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,526
I can't take it anymore.

193
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,989
Oh, I could die...

194
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,789
No, you can't die
yet. See? Look at this.

195
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,459
See how much energy I still have!

196
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,002
H-How can that be?

197
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,998
If you've worn yourself out down
there, why don't we use your other hole?

198
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,069
M-My other hole?

199
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,008
Your penis is way too big!

200
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,039
Too bad, because I'm going
to do it anyway, that I am!

201
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,777
Ow that hurt!

202
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,646
Didn't you say that you'd
gone through Spartan training?

203
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,157
I'm sure this is nothing compared
to that! You really shouldn't whine.

204
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,589
B-But!

205
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,267
That training really did you a lot of
good, you're amazingly tight, that you are!

206
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,097
See, it doesn't hurt anymore, does it?

207
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,172
It still hurts!

208
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,712
My body's going to rip apart!

209
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,450
I guess that's enough for today...

210
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,464
This is what I was looking for!

211
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,180
I managed to get one of them...

212
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,130
That was just luck...

213
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,157
I got this piece of the
map by accident, but...

214
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:30,099
...how am I going to get my hands on the
rest when I'm no good at martial arts?

215
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,301
The most important
thing is Sayo, though...

216
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,781
She must be all grown up by now.

217
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,344
Just thinking about
it makes my nose bleed!

218
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,052
Calm down, calm down!

219
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,796
Life isn't that easy, after all!

220
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,841
I'm going to sleep.

221
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,508
I have some long days
ahead of me, that I do.

222
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,459
Someone's there...

223
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,488
What a fool to invade my home!

224
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,055
I said I was finished...

225
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,458
Come on, let me get some
sleep, for god's sake!

226
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,902
Another female ninja!

227
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,682
Not to mention another babe!

228
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,255
Who the hell are you?

229
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,296
I was suffocating.

230
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,027
I thought I was going to die!

231
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,599
I'll ask you one more time.

232
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,833
Who the hell are you?

233
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,475
L-I'm just a traveler, that I am.

234
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,038
I'm spending the night here, that's all...

235
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,547
I'm not going to let you
make free with my home!

236
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,707
Oh, I understand!

237
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,649
I'm very, very sorry, I'll be on my way.

238
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,550
So if you'll forgive me...

239
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:58,750
You wish!

240
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,552
I wish? You mean you'll let me stay?

241
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:06,721
I've never before allowed anyone under
my spell to leave this place alive!

242
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,432
Oh, so you mean...

243
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,556
...I'll have to kill you!

244
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,272
Suffer!

245
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,571
Suffer, and bid
this world farewell!

246
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:24,409
Your mangled flesh and bones
will be all that's left of you.

247
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,949
I'll feed you to my darling children!

248
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,284
C-Can't take it anymore...

249
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,120
Wait, I can't just give up!

250
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:41,221
Didn't I promise to find Sayo and return
home with her, or was that just a lie?

251
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,363
Somehow I've got to find a way
to escape from this monster...

252
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,969
There just has to be a way!

253
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,700
Wait a second...

254
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,877
I've got it!

255
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:57,539
Snakes are the same as humans,
they must have erogenous zones too!

256
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,197
L-Is this the end?

257
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,168
So she and the snake are one?

258
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,899
I see, that's all I need to know!

259
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,529
That feels amazing!

260
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,551
What delicious juice you're secreting!

261
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,518
Not only that, but
this smell is so divine!

262
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,081
Y-You're full of it!

263
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,086
That's what you say,
but you're turning red!

264
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,964
You like it, don't you?

265
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,995
I'm so embarrassed!

266
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:33,701
Yes!

267
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,508
I can see you're a lot
more naÏÏve than you look!

268
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,812
Look at me.

269
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:48,787
See? Your juice is all over my mouth.

270
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,787
What a filthy body!

271
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,004
Put me into your mouth...

272
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,604
I can't do that...

273
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,477
Oh, then you want me to stop right now?

274
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,846
No! No!

275
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,381
You can't stop!

276
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,184
Well, make up your mind!

277
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,817
L-I want this...

278
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,122
What do you mean by "this"?

279
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,422
I mean this!

280
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:27,896
You'll have to say the word!

281
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,023
I don't want to!

282
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,101
No, I actually I do!

283
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,834
What are you talking about?

284
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,437
I want this, put it in me now!

285
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,568
As you wish!

286
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,941
This slimy texture...

287
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,848
How reptilian!

288
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,695
A burning snake is
slithering throughout my body...

289
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,871
So amazing!

290
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,383
I can feel it...

291
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,924
It's so huge, I can feel it inside me.

292
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:35,363
Go ahead and do whatever
you want to yourself.

293
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,233
Don't stop, just turn around...

294
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,835
I'm about to come...

295
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:46,706
Oh, please come!

296
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,445
Please, I can't take it anymore!

297
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,978
I'm going to explode!

298
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,193
That makes two...

299
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,358
Another one...

300
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,437
Another one of my disciples
has fallen, I hear.

301
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,072
Whose doing is this?

302
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:59,445
Someone has been
disturbing the peace here.

303
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,415
It must be one of Saotome's spies.

304
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:06,319
Since I've lost two of my
disciples, I cannot let this go...

305
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:07,453
Hanakage!

306
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,184
Sir!

307
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,985
Mugen!

308
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,651
Sir!

309
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,796
Find this man and kill him!

310
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:12,590
Yes, sir!

311
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,964
You've improved immensely.

312
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:20,162
All that rigorous training I put
you through has come to fruition!

313
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:24,970
You have made Sayo very happy with
your words of praise, Lord Muhousai...

314
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,356
How many more pieces do I
need to get the whole map?

315
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:45,852
More importantly, Sayo...

316
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,657
I have to find her as soon
as possible, that I do!

317
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:59,007
Who will next try to thwart
him as he continues on his way?
