1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,460
Hey, Tomomi-kun...

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,630
Are you hiding something from me?

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,390
Huh? Have you ever known me
to keep something from you?

4
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,890
You've got a point there.

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,770
Have faith in me.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,650
I do have faith in you.

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,730
But I'm worried about that secretary.

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,400
Oh, her. She's still sleeping at home.

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,030
She's still at our house?

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,750
Yeah. She said something about all
the huge debts we have to pay off.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,080
I figured we'd ask her to explain
everything in detail after school.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,130
So I let her stay at our place until then.

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,670
Idiot! Why didn't you tell me?

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,380
Because I think she's making
the whole thing up anyway.

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,970
Tomomi-kun, let me handle her.

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,230
I don't want you poking your nose
into strange places. Okay?

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,770
S-Sure.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,010
Amy to Yobanaide
Don't call me Amy! - episode 2

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,290
Good morning.

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,540
Hitomi-san!

21
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,380
Did you talk to Tomomi-kun about me?

22
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,460
Talk about what?

23
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,300
And that reminds me,

24
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,430
what the hell did you say to the
Commissioner yesterday?

25
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,810
Hayami-san, the Commissioner wants
you in her office right away.

26
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,650
Hayami Emi reporting.

27
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,240
Enter, please.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,530
Excuse me.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,660
S-Sensei?

30
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,630
Ouch!

31
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,260
So you've made your decision, Amy.

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,840
Kyoko-sensei!

33
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,010
Come forth, my cute little beasts.

34
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,520
What?

35
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,320
Amy, let me come in you.

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,700
She's struggling.

37
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,200
We'll make you feel good real soon, Amy.

38
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,080
No! I am not Amy!

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,380
Stop it!

40
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,340
No!

41
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,350
Someone, help me!

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,150
We will now awaken the lewd spirit within you, Amy.

43
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,110
But I'm not Amy.

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,740
No!

45
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,210
<i>Why? Why are you doing this to me?</i>

46
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,050
Stop it!

47
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,010
I'll make you feel even better now.

48
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,850
Ouch! Stop it.

49
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,820
That pain will feel good in time, Amy.

50
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,830
Come, show us your true nature, Amy.

51
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,050
Down here, you're telling me you're
soft and wet and want me inside.

52
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,810
No! Someone save me!

53
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,650
Come on, come on.

54
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,570
Forgive me!

55
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,040
<i>No... I was saving my body for Tomomi-kun...</i>

56
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,420
That s very good, Amy.

57
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,340
Be honest about who you really are.

58
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,850
<i>No. No. I'm not lewd.</i>

59
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,770
<i>But. But.</i>

60
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,740
<i>this feels so good!</i>

61
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,110
<i>This isn't the real me. That's right</i>

62
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,160
<i>I'm just having one of my ridiculous fantasies. And I...</i>

63
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,660
<i>I feel like I'm going insane!</i>

64
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,710
<i>More... I want more!</i>

65
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,680
Call me Amy!

66
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,980
A-Amy!

67
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,810
Amy.

68
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,070
<i>That feels great!</i>

69
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,000
Even though it's her first time,

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,500
thanks to all the dirty fantasies she's had,

71
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,460
her body knows exactly what to do.

72
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,180
Amy, tell me. Does it feel good?

73
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,640
It... It feels good!

74
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,480
And you owe it all to me, Amy!

75
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,150
More! More!

76
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,610
You'll become a sacred Flesh Slave.

77
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,000
You're under my control now. There is no escape.

78
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,510
<i>My body has become a soiled beast.</i>

79
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,510
<i>It's true.</i>

80
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,550
<i>No matter how much my heart
rejects it my body loves it.</i>

81
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,470
<i>How can I face Tomomi-kun now?</i>

82
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,900
<i>But no matter how soiled I am, Tomomi,
I'll still take care of you.</i>

83
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,740
Hayami-san!

84
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,120
Are you okay?

85
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey!

86
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,170
Hitomi-san...

87
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,680
You poor thing. What did she do to you?

88
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,600
Thanks, Hitomi-san.

89
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,150
Stay still. This will sting a little.

90
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,910
We'd better get along, for Tomomi-san's sake.

91
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,920
That's right! I have to find Tomomi-kun.

92
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,540
Do you know where he is?

93
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,750
He's wandering around looking for you.

94
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,050
He turned me down.

95
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,300
I wonder...

96
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,550
if you're the one Tomomi-kun really loves.

97
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,140
So when I saw you yesterday
with Tomomi-kun, that was...

98
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,060
Look how dirty you are!

99
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,900
I'll lick you clean.

100
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,910
Hitomi-san!

101
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,210
Who did this to you?

102
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,130
In the Commissioner's office...

103
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,460
Kyoko-sensei did.

104
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,590
She did?

105
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,880
She said I was a "Flesh Slave'' or something.

106
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,180
Then these men she called her "cute beasts" came in.

107
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,680
Hitomi-san?

108
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,790
What a messed up school.

109
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,210
I can't leave Tomomi-kun here by himself.

110
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,710
<i>We'd better find a new school to attend together.</i>

111
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,670
<i>I hope he's home when I get there.</i>

112
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,720
Oh, hi there.

113
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,890
It's you.

114
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,010
I'm sorry.

115
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,310
When the bank heard the good Hayami
name, it erased your father's debts.

116
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,310
Did I do that?

117
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,610
Oh? Then Tomomi-sama might have done it.

118
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,440
No way! He couldn't do something like that.

119
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,490
Tell me, where is he right now?

120
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,990
He's not home at the moment.

121
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,160
Not at home?

122
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,370
Is it possible...

123
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,000
Is he trying to take care of our tuition?

124
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,750
Tomomi-kun! Stay away from the Commissioner!

125
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:38,090
<i>Perhaps Tomomi-sama surrendered to the
Hayami corporation of his own free will,</i>

126
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,680
<i>just as I planned.</i>

127
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,770
Tomomi-kun. Tomomi-kun!

128
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,190
Where did he go?

129
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,490
Ah! Forgive me, please!

130
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,610
That voice...

131
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,120
Come now. Crawl along for me.

132
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,220
Good! Now crawl around some more!

133
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,140
<i>It's Hitomi-san! And Kyoko-sensei as well.</i>

134
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,800
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

135
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,360
The infirmary?

136
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,240
Forgive me, please!

137
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,330
Well done, Hitomi-chan!

138
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,330
Don't forget what I taught you.

139
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,670
I won't, Onee-sama!

140
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,760
<i>Sumirie-sensei and Hitomi-san are sisters?</i>

141
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,600
Forgive me.

142
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,140
Harder, whip her harder!

143
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,230
That's what you get for going after
someone else when I'm all you need!

144
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,660
I hear you were trying to keep Amy to yourself.

145
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,320
Confess now!

146
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,910
S-Stop it!

147
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,710
You abandoned our mission!

148
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,210
Our mission is to defend the sacred secret!

149
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,590
I'm so sorry.

150
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,800
How could this happen!?

151
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,510
I'm sure she secretly wanted to keep
Tomomi-sama all to herself.

152
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,890
Please, forgive me!

153
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,070
We've been so careful to protect this until
his birthday, and you've ruined it all!

154
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,700
Tomomi-kun?

155
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,660
I drank some of Tomomi-sama's bodily
fluids yesterday by the shed.

156
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:18,040
If we leave things the way they are,
his once-in-a-century body will explode!

157
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,130
Kyoko!

158
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,250
That special body type belongs exclusively to our clan!

159
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,420
Where did you hide Tomomi-sama!?

160
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,300
I swear, I don't know!

161
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,970
Hey, you!

162
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,010
Amy!

163
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,100
I am not Amy!

164
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,140
I knew that she'd followed me here.

165
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,770
Onee-sama, we should tell Amy
the secret of the Hayami clan.

166
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,650
Don't call me Amy!

167
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,780
I'll make it impossible for you to
approach Tomomi-sama again.

168
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,070
Your body will learn to obey us!

169
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,080
Onee-chan!

170
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,920
<i>Tomomi-kun... Tomomi,</i>

171
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,960
<i>I promise I'll save you.</i>

172
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,560
If Tomomi-sama comes between those thighs,

173
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,980
do you have any idea what will happen?

174
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,150
His once-in-a-century special body type
will be lost and destroyed forever!

175
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,280
Yes, Onee-sama.

176
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,950
Yesterday at the shed, I did behold
some of his sacred body.

177
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,990
Really?

178
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,120
I want it. I want it.

179
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,130
I want the person who will melt into my hot body.

180
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,000
I want Amy!

181
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,630
- No, you shouldn't, Tomomi-sama!
- Move! You're in my way!

182
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,390
This is my clan's treasure!

183
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,050
It's a precious family heirloom!

184
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,770
Let go of me! I can't contain myself anymore!

185
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,560
Please calm down.

186
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,440
I will partake of your overflowing energy.

187
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,460
I only swallowed a little,

188
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,290
but l still feel the effects strongly within me.

189
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,010
It took all my strength to carry Emi to the infirmary

190
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,180
and to prevent her from seeing him.

191
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,470
And I know what happened
after that. You traitor, Kyoko.

192
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,430
You stole Amy while we weren't looking

193
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,310
and tried to make Tomomi-sama exclusively yours!

194
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,060
That will not go unpunished!

195
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,650
Where did you hide Tomomi-sama?

196
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,410
Come! Confess now.

197
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,990
I-I don't know.

198
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,160
Silence! I will not tolerate feigned ignorance!

199
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,760
Let Tomomi-kun go!

200
00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:00,350
Amy, it seems you still don't understand
the position you're in.

201
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,430
You're a beast who can't think of anything but sex!

202
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,190
How mean! Now I'm really pissed!

203
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,270
Shut up, Amy!

204
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,120
My!

205
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,580
Amy wants it.

206
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,670
You want this, don't you, Amy?

207
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,090
Stop it!

208
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,730
I will protect Tomomi-kun from you beasts!

209
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,280
Stop it now!

210
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,550
Okay!

211
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,220
Untie me now if you know what's good for you!

212
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,310
Unless you want to be electrocuted, that is!

213
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,480
<i>Tomomi-kun!</i>

214
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,580
S-Sumirie-sama!

215
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,040
Wake up, Sumirie-sama!

216
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,660
Rie!

217
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,750
Amy got away.

218
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,750
Where is Tomomi-sama?

219
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,130
Don't worry.

220
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,250
Tomomi-sama is aware of everything now.

221
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,380
He is?

222
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,720
He went to Hayami headquarters on his own.

223
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
So he...

224
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,100
Correct. He's going to give his sacred body to us.

225
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,810
To our clan?

226
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,940
Yes.

227
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,650
He signed the will of his own accord,

228
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:20,200
and received the legacy we set aside for
him to pay for his tuition and housing.

229
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,450
Onee-sama!

230
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,780
It's like a dream come true!

231
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,950
Yeah.

232
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,540
Then, does that mean he and Amy won't...

233
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,710
Yes. The two of them will fight, and she will lose.

234
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,220
I must get ready to meet Tomomi-sama
when he comes to us!

235
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,760
She's right! This isn't a time to stand around.

236
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,680
As soon as possible, we must join the Hayami clan!

237
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,600
The Hayami clan!

238
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,620
Tomomi! He did come home!

239
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,410
Tomomi-kun!

240
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,620
Onee-chan! Happy birthday!

241
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,000
Tomomi-kun!

242
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Onee-chan...

243
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,646
I was so worried about you!

244
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:22,997
I'm sorry. Where were you?

245
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,930
That's right! That's something I wanted to ask you.

246
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,480
I wanted to see if that debt was real
or not so I went to ask about it.

247
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,640
But the debt..

248
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,820
Don't worry about it. It was all a lie.

249
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,440
Really? For sure?

250
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,860
Really, for sure.

251
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,320
That lady who called herself your fathers
secretary was just spewing lies.

252
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,790
Nothing makes sense anymore.

253
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,960
So you don't have to worry about a
place to stay or your school tuition.

254
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:03,630
Tomomi, did someone do something weird to you?

255
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,130
Something?

256
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,300
Onee-chan, what are you worried about?

257
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,770
Then I guess that's okay.

258
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:17,100
<i>That hurricane of crazy things that happened
to me today were just illusions?</i>

259
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,320
Get a hold of yourself, Onee-chan.

260
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,740
I'm sure you're just confusing fantasy
with reality, like you always do.

261
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,490
Don't be stupid. I'm not confused.

262
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,410
And technically you're younger than me.

263
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,160
Don't worry about me.

264
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,540
Sorry, sorry, Onee-chan.

265
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,040
Huh? Do you smell something weird, Onee-chan?

266
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,380
Stupid, stupid! That tickles.

267
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,220
I've been running around all day too.

268
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,890
You're probably smelling my sweat.

269
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,060
Well, go take a quick shower then.

270
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,773
Everything's decorated, and the curry's ready too.

271
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,319
Thanks. I'm looking forward to a delicious dinner.

272
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,820
You can count on me.

273
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,080
I feel like I'm possessed or something.

274
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,362
There's Hitomi-san and Sumirie-sensei...

275
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,000
and Kyoko-sensei and that lady who
called herself Dad's secretary.

276
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,330
I wonder who they really are?

277
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,960
I guess my daydreams have gotten
too elaborate. I must really be sick.

278
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,920
Onee-chan?

279
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,670
Don't stay in there forever. Your curry's getting cold.

280
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,130
Ah, sorry.

281
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,270
Onee-chan, are you okay?

282
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,070
Hey...

283
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,410
Will you promise to stay with me forever?

284
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,990
Of course I will.

285
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,410
Then, will you kiss me?

286
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,160
Eh, that's kinda embarrassing.

287
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,790
You're silly.

288
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,170
My heart and body belong to you.

289
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,960
B-But..

290
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,840
Aw, you coward. If you can't do it, then let me.

291
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,470
Ow-ow-ow-ow.

292
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,890
Huh? Morning?

293
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,520
What a big bump. Did that happen
when I was in the bath?

294
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,990
Which means these pajamas...

295
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,950
and panties...

296
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,120
Tomomi-kun put them on?

297
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,420
Wow.

298
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,300
You'll catch cold, Onee-chan.

299
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,050
I'm coming in.

300
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,720
Tomomi-kun!

301
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,760
Onee-chan...

302
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,270
Tomomi!

303
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,900
I wonder if he's okay?

304
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,190
I hope he didn't pass out from shock!

305
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,110
Tomomi-kun!

306
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,870
Tomomi-kun?

307
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,720
<i>Onee-chan, thanks for everyhing.</i>

308
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,100
<i>For reasons I'd rather not explain, I've moved out.</i>

309
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,430
<i>Don't worry. I'll be okay.</i>

310
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,400
<i>I know you'll have a hard time alone, but stay strong.</i>

311
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,110
<i>I'll never forget my happy days living
with you as long as I live.</i>

312
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,490
<i>Thank you...</i>

313
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,610
<i>and goodbye. To my beloved Onee-chan. Tomomi.</i>

314
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,450
How? Why?

315
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,810
What is the Hayami main estate?

316
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,720
Kyoko!

317
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,560
That special body type belongs exclusively to our clan!

318
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,600
Where did you hide Tomomi-sama!?

319
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,980
That wasn't a daydream.

320
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,280
It really happened!

321
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,900
Then, that also...

322
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,110
No! Stop it!

323
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,750
And that too?

324
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,920
And also that?

325
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,550
Stop it!

326
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,390
It all happened for real?

327
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,810
You look great Amy.

328
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,560
