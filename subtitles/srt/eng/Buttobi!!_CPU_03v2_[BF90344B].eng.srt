1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,570
Welcome Mimi!

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,250
Welcome Mimi!
Mimi, did you come from Colombia
just to study in Japan?

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,850
Yes.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,080
How do you like Japan
compared to Colombia?

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,490
I think it's really nice here.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,760
Then which do you like better?
Colombian or Japanese men?

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,200
Of course she likes Colombian men.
Isn't that right, Mimi?

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,800
Mimi is amazing.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,470
She's suddenly become so popular.

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,130
It's only for a little while.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:30,800
What?

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,200
Everybody's just curious about a
new student from a foreign country.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,040
Hey Shimada, are you
jealous of Mimi again?

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,440
Hey, I'm not like that.

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,180
I've got an idea.
I... I'll show Mimi around the campus.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,790
S... Shimada, I'll go with you, too.

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,320
Hey, Akira!

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,030
Let's go to the Electric Brain
Study Club later...

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,190
I've got something
interesting to show you.

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,800
Something interesting?

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:18,640
Forgive me I keep you riding
on uneasy feelings all the time.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,990
Cause I wanna know
everything about you

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,690
My heart starts to
drive itself uncontrollably

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,490
And I can't help
feeling great joy.

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,230
More nervous than before
because I can't tell you

26
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,260
I have a desire to
love you more and more

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,130
But this emptiness
is the other side of love

28
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,100
Only if you take us
to a more extreme level

29
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,810
Your hot access

30
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,910
Is what I am really waiting for

31
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,040
Most likely I will get
you in more trouble

32
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,120
But please accept my wholeness

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,460
With my heart kept innocent
like I'm bare naked in front of you

34
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,190
As I stand close to you

35
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,970
Your hot access

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,200
Is what I am longing for

37
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,010
Graceful Reset

38
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,250
That's the gym.

39
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,020
There are athletic
clubhouses behind the gym.

40
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,450
Mimi, you should join some clubs
if you want to enjoy college life.

41
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,290
What happened to you, Shimada?

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,160
You're somehow too nice to Mimi.
Completely different from before.

43
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,990
Well, I'm always nice to everybody.

44
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,770
Besides, we are very good friends.

45
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,400
Aren't we, Mimi?

46
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,230
Yes.

47
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,270
Oh?

48
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,140
What's this?

49
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,870
Mimi has a ring on her ring finger.

50
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,340
Let me see.

51
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,980
It's true.

52
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,310
Maybe Mimi has a
boyfriend in Colombia.

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,590
Oh, is it true, Mimi?

54
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,190
No, this is a write protect ring
that my master used...

55
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,760
Yeah!! That's right!!

56
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,490
Somebody in Colombia,
is waiting for Mimi!

57
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,090
Huh?

58
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,000
That's nice, Mimi.
It sounds very romantic.

59
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,230
I want to have a boyfriend
who can give me a ring, too.

60
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:17,870
Huh?

61
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,240
Did something get
in your eye, Shimada?

62
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,270
Yes, but there's no wind today.

63
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,380
Akira!!

64
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,540
W... what's wrong, Mimi?

65
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,280
I willjoin the same clubs that you
belong to and enjoy college life.

66
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,920
The same clubs as me?

67
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,750
You're going to join
the Electric Brain Club?

68
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,520
Yes... Yes.
Do you want tojoin the club?

69
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,460
Let's invite Mimi to our
Electric Brain Study Club meeting.

70
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,630
Wait for me!

71
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,510
Centris.

72
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,980
I know Quadra, my dear sister.

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,780
But I don't like that our
little Sister Performa...

74
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,340
is telling us what to do!

75
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,480
We don't have any choice.

76
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,020
Last time we were defeated
by an AX named Mimi.

77
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,890
That's because we
weren't fighting seriously!

78
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,830
But defeat is defeat.

79
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,170
We just have to do it.

80
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,940
Then, shall we go?

81
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,260
Our target is the
Japanese bio-types!

82
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,230
Anyway, the Electric Brain Study
Club has only three members...

83
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,010
Akira, Futoshi and me.

84
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,040
It's just a computer lover's club.

85
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,910
By the way Junpei, what's
on the disk you just had?

86
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,740
Thanks for reminding me about that.

87
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,780
Ta-Daa! This is a computer virus.

88
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,680
Oh, a computer virus.

89
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,560
Oh no, a virus?
Are there any germs inside?

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,260
You are really stupid when
it comes to computers.

91
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,630
Listen, Shimada...

92
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,070
this is a virus to destroy
data inside a computer.

93
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,610
Actually, this is a germ
for a computer, though.

94
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,850
It's a new virus called worm.

95
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,710
It's just like a worm
but it eats up data.

96
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,710
Worm eats up data?

97
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,980
Shimada, perhaps you've got it wrong.

98
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,860
She definitely misunderstood.

99
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,390
What's wrong, Mimi?

100
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,420
She looks pale.

101
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,430
I'm not feeling well.

102
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,070
Mimi!?

103
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,700
Mimi!?

104
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,070
What was that sound?

105
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,340
Hey Mimi, what's wrong?

106
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,440
Hey, Mimi!

107
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,440
Master, let's do it.

108
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,210
Memory expansion, let's do it here.

109
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,890
What are you talking about?!

110
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,650
We already did it twice last night.

111
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,490
But, I want it.

112
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,690
Don't be stupid!

113
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,530
What?

114
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,100
Who's being stupid?

115
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,940
Mimi is acting really silly.

116
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,430
She must have
eaten something weird.

117
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,800
Are you all right Mimi?

118
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,840
She's all right.

119
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,570
I forgot I have to
go someplace today!

120
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,840
See you!!!

121
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,050
What's wrong with him?

122
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,990
Next is...?

123
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,500
N... no way!

124
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,430
This security protection
is completely broken.

125
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,830
Security protection?

126
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,700
Is it?

127
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,040
You should be more careful.

128
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,670
Your rear is completely
unprotected from outside input.

129
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,010
Hey, I'm trying to
be more serious here.

130
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,490
Are you two here
to bother me again...

131
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,950
Nac sisters?

132
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,560
You won't beat me
so easily this time!

133
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,710
Don't even bother.

134
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,920
You better listen to us.

135
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,220
You'll pay for last time!

136
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,430
I told you, don't even bother.

137
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,100
That's right.

138
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,580
Fight! Fight!

139
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,290
Thank you master.

140
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,890
Then I will carry
you and run this time.

141
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,520
Just sit here!

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,590
Mimi!

143
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,790
What's the matter with you?

144
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,530
I guess I've hung up.

145
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,000
Hung up? I see.

146
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,240
Mimi, you must have a
reset switch on you somewhere.

147
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,070
Yes! I have!

148
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,570
Where is it?

149
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,350
I'll have to whisper it to you.

150
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,010
Really?

151
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,980
Yes.

152
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,790
Tricked you! Tricked you!

153
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,330
Mimi!

154
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,000
Akira!

155
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,460
It's Shimada!

156
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,770
This is bad!

157
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,900
Takaoka, where are you?

158
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,430
It's strange, I thought
he was around here.

159
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,380
Shimada, you run very fast.

160
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,350
Of course, I am the
co-captain of the tennis club.

161
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,080
But why did you guys follow me?

162
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,650
We thought we might
have a chance to see bloodshed.

163
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,890
What?

164
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,520
Don't be stupid!

165
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,820
You guys give me a headache!

166
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,420
Hey, wait Shimada!

167
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,060
I can't relax yet.

168
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,970
Is there any place
to hide around here?

169
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,540
Oh, yeah!

170
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,480
Bootobi Electronic Store

171
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,880
Hello.

172
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,150
Hey Takaoka, how are you doing?

173
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,120
Where is the bathroom?

174
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,280
All the way down to the left.

175
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,560
Thank you.

176
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,240
Are we expanding the
memory in the toilet today?

177
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,300
No!!

178
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,600
Now tell me Mimi,
where is the reset switch?!

179
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,270
OK, I'll show you now.

180
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,440
Not again!

181
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,880
You don't have to
take off your clothes.

182
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,990
But... the reset switch is here.

183
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,820
Here, you mean your bellybutton?

184
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,360
That's right!

185
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,120
Alright.

186
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,400
Mimi?

187
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,770
Hey, what's the matter?

188
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,570
Mimi?

189
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,440
Are you...?

190
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,850
Hey, Mimi!

191
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,710
Yes, Master!

192
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,980
What was I doing?

193
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,650
I'm the one who should be
asking you that question.

194
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,400
When you reset my bellybutton, the
previous 24 hours of memory is erased.

195
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,500
What?

196
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,890
Then the memory
expansion last night is?

197
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,670
Yes... it's all gone.

198
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,400
So, I need to have more memory...

199
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,110
otherwise my performance
will be substandard.

200
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,050
Sorry we were using
the bathroom so long.

201
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,120
But it really helped.

202
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,320
Don't worry.

203
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,190
But, Takaoka, are you all right?

204
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,250
You look pale.

205
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,160
I'm fine!
Just a little tired.

206
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,820
Takaoka!

207
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,430
I was right.

208
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,560
I thought you might stop by here.

209
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,970
We were worried about you
and started looking around.

210
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,370
I guess Mimi got better.

211
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,370
Yes.

212
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,740
Akira reset my bellybutton.

213
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,540
Yes, yes!

214
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,170
She means I got her some medicine.

215
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,180
Right, Mimi?

216
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,080
What?

217
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,520
Why are you saying such weird things?

218
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,020
Takaoka, do you know how
much we worried about you?

219
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,180
You disappeared all of a sudden!

220
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,650
Well, because...

221
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,160
We're finally gonna
see some bloodshed.

222
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,230
What?

223
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,230
What's this?

224
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,440
Junpei!

225
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,300
Did you use the computer virus?

226
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,200
Why would I do such a thing?

227
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,440
I have the disk in here.

228
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,340
Then what's going on here?

229
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,010
Look out!

230
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,150
What the hell is going on?

231
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,760
What happened?

232
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,740
You did well, evading
my hypnotic beam.

233
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,230
Even though you're an older model...

234
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,240
I guess you must have some
skill since you beat my sisters.

235
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,380
Although, you seemed rather weak
when I hacked into your data.

236
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,110
Mimi was acting
strangely because of you?!

237
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,840
I am the third sister of the Nac sisters,
Performa Nackintosh.

238
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,820
We're not naked this time.

239
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,520
Last time, I was lacking in memory.

240
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,920
I see!

241
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,460
If Mimi's memory is fully expanded,
then we don't have to be naked.

242
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,030
Master, you're embarrassing me.

243
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,090
So you like doing full uploads.

244
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,770
Why aren't you listening to me?!!

245
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,550
Mimi!

246
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,720
Is that all you've got?

247
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,350
You're boring me!

248
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,380
Performa!

249
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,630
Sisters, you are so slow.

250
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,670
Why do you always
talk to us like that!?

251
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,830
We did everything
that you told us to do.

252
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,870
Thank you for your hard work.
Then how did everything go?

253
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,440
No problems, of course.

254
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,340
Once we do something,
we do it right, just like this.

255
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,310
Forte!

256
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,480
And, so many other
Japanese bio-types are here.

257
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,220
Not bad, but the two of you should've
been able to do this very easily.

258
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,060
She is really getting stuck up.

259
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,500
What are you doing collecting
so many Japanese bio-types?

260
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,970
Performa!

261
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,260
What's next?

262
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,610
We must copy all of
the data from them.

263
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,510
Can't you figure out
these things on your own?

264
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,970
Hey, Performa!

265
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,140
Why the rude attitude
towards your sisters?!

266
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,680
I'm the one in charge
of this operation...

267
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,980
so why don't you
just follow my orders.

268
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,450
They seem like they hate each other.

269
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,720
Especially Performa,
she looks really mean.

270
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,220
That's enough!

271
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,560
Centris, you better
follow Performa's orders.

272
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,290
Big sister Quadra, as usual,
you are very sensible.

273
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,370
Now, I want you to copy
all the data from them.

274
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,810
I can'tjust sit here and watch.

275
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,740
Mimi, let's beat up the Nacs
and help everybody.

276
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,710
You're wonderful, Akira!

277
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,720
I said your name right!

278
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,390
Please be quick, sisters.

279
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,090
OK, OK.

280
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,000
So, you're going to show me
all your data this time.

281
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,300
Security protection released.

282
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,770
OK.

283
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,780
Now let's take a look
at what's inside.

284
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,650
W... what is this?

285
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,120
Nippon Bank and
the Ministry of Finance.

286
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,150
Almost all the
government data is here.

287
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,460
That looks really useful.

288
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,100
Quadra, why don't you
hurry and copy the data?

289
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,100
All right.

290
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,730
My breasts have 1000
terabytes of memory...

291
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,140
and can take anything
that you might want.

292
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,450
Now, let's start.

293
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,610
That's too heavy.

294
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,550
Akira!

295
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,290
You better decide
what we should do!

296
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:49,950
Sure!

297
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,840
Shit!

298
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,970
Oh well, I can buy
another computer.

299
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,780
Data transfer is completed
from all the bio-types.

300
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,980
Now please dispose of them.

301
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,290
I will take care of that AX.

302
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,550
What do you mean by "dispose"?

303
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,320
Don't ask me such
an obvious question!

304
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,830
We've no need
of worthless junk.

305
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,270
You mean throw them away?

306
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,930
But we can still
use them for something.

307
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,800
That's your character flaw,
dear sisters.

308
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,040
Worthless things should be
thrown away immediately.

309
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,210
It's also important to study
your enemy thoroughly!

310
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,380
Rather than just kill them!

311
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,510
The data we extracted from them
is more than enough information!

312
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,350
But we're all computers!

313
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,120
They may be like you,
but don't associate them with me!

314
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,450
Don't act so rude!
You're the youngest sister!

315
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,160
Data load completed!

316
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,290
Attack and defense motion stage 5!

317
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,030
Mimi, beat the Nacs
and save us all!

318
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,930
Yes!

319
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,590
Run armor device!

320
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,710
Setup completed!

321
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,190
Let's go Nackintosh!

322
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,610
Performa!!

323
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,690
I'm still talking to you!

324
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,550
Can't multi-task.

325
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,830
Are you all right, Forte?

326
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,960
We came here to save you.

327
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,740
Mimi's here, too.

328
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,840
So you don't have
to worry anymore.

329
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,600
We'll help you.

330
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,910
Mimi will take care of the Nacs.

331
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,450
I said wait!

332
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,760
Performa!

333
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,020
I want to settle this right now!

334
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,260
Are you listening to me, Performa?!

335
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,450
This is the easiest way
to avoid the beam attack.

336
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,430
What happened to me?

337
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,610
Where are Akira and Mimi?

338
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,670
Hey, Junpei, Futoshi!

339
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,880
It's no use,
they're out cold.

340
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,320
Oh, Junpei what did you do?!

341
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,890
The person who owns this shop
will blame this mess on us.

342
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,460
I have to clean up quickly.

343
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,730
The game ends here, Ms. AX.

344
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:52,970
Mimi!!

345
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,800
You're no challenge to me!

346
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,610
Stop!!

347
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,780
Don't shoot Mimi!

348
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,880
Akira!?

349
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,420
Fool!

350
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,550
It's dangerous to expose
yourself like this!

351
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,590
Akira, run!!!

352
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,030
Forte?

353
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,390
Everyone?

354
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,750
You... make a good master.

355
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,960
True Japanese Ioyalty!

356
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,260
It makes me cry no matter
how many times I see it.

357
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,030
I have to clean up before
the staff in the shop wakes up.

358
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,700
OK... this must go... in here!

359
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,070
Hello.

360
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,240
What the hell is this?

361
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,840
It looks disgusting!

362
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,610
Forte...

363
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,480
A waste of time!

364
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,720
Mimi!

365
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,620
What should I do?!

366
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,790
What is this?!

367
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,770
How can I get rid of this!?

368
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,140
No way!

369
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,710
Now I'll finish you!!

370
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,040
Hello.

371
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,480
Th... that's!

372
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,360
What the hell is this?

373
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,090
Disgusting!

374
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,350
That must be Junpei's virus!

375
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,930
Mimi, this is our chance.

376
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,690
Yes!

377
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,770
You've stirred up an
innocent girl's anger!!

378
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,610
I won't give up so easily!
Remember that!

379
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,580
Oh shit!!!!

380
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,940
Well!

381
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,740
Who's next?

382
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,350
Oh well, perhaps this was
good medicine for Performa.

383
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,430
Actually, it was a virus.

384
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,660
Time to say goodbye!

385
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,170
They must've had so
many chances to attack us.

386
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,170
Oh yeah.

387
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,010
We have to help
Forte and the others.

388
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,670
Let's take them to the house.

389
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,180
Hello, Takaoka speaking.

390
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,920
Oh, Shimada.

391
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,710
Akira, what happened today?

392
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,590
What?

393
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,390
Mimi wasn't feeling well again.

394
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,890
Oh really, that's too bad.

395
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,130
We had quite a bit of trouble, too.

396
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,100
What?

397
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,470
When I was cleaning up
the disks on the floor...

398
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,700
I inserted Junpei's
virus by mistake.

399
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,700
What?

400
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,610
You mean you put it in the computer?

401
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,010
Yes, I'm responsible...

402
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
You're responsible for
saving us, Shimada!

403
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,610
So, it was you.

404
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,750
I owe you one.

405
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,620
See ya!

406
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,090
So, will she live?

407
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,290
All the data has been removed,
and her memory is gone too.

408
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,030
Then, the only thing we can do
is delete her like the other AE.

409
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,430
There is one way to save her.

410
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,070
How?

411
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,770
If you give her a memory install.

412
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,770
Why me?

413
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,050
Besides, she has a protect ring.

414
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,070
She won't accept another
man's data, will she?

415
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,810
This may be risky.

416
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:03,180
Forte could still move even
when all her memory was taken...

417
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:07,660
because she saw you were willing
to risk your life to protect me.

418
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,860
She felt your warmth and caring.

419
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,460
If you do a re-installation, maybe...

420
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,780
All right!

421
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,120
Her installer has started!

422
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,590
I will open the utility file.

423
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,820
You will have to match
the reset timing.

424
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,530
B... but I can't control it!

425
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,770
File opened.

426
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,500
Three... two... one... reset!

427
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,710
You did it!

428
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,080
You did it, Akira!

429
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,270
You succeeded!

430
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
I... actually succeeded.

431
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,090
Thank you very much, Master.

432
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,550
No... I don't deserve to be thanked.

433
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,650
What?

434
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,690
Master?

435
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,060
Now you are... because you
are the one who did the install.

436
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,200
Forte, we have the same master, now.

437
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,730
Yes, I appreciate it.

438
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,970
I... it can't be.

439
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,400
Akira.

440
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,010
You still have all the
rest to re-install.

441
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,550
So let's work hard
at it together, Akira.

442
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,980
I'll do my best.

443
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,190
You are the best master, Akira.

444
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,870
Type is small for each other

445
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,810
Although we hurt each other

446
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,050
In the name of fate we
are destined to be together

447
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,560
My heart still believes more than ever

448
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,060
Ending never
Expanding memory forever

449
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,230
Dreaming of that kind of love

450
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,070
No matter how much the
program takes over my heart

451
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,100
Since I feel so sure of your faith in me

452
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,700
Your hot access

453
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,510
I feel more love from you

454
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,730
Most likely I will get
you into more trouble

455
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,070
But please accept my wholeness

456
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,010
With my heart kept innocent like
I'm bare naked in front of you

457
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,680
As I stand close to you

458
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,450
Your hot access

459
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,550
Is what I am longing for
