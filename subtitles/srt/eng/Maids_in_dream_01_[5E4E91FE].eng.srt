00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,710
Maids in Dream
Episode One:

2
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,370
Welcome Master

3
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,170
I'm so glad.

4
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,010
I'm really happy.

5
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,010
Who are you?

6
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,850
I'm Sazuron,
a servant of this house.

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,420
Glad to be of service to you.

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,300
How are you feeling, Master?

9
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,570
Where am I?

10
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,640
Master, are you all right?
We were so worried.

11
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,540
That Master you're addressing, is it me?

12
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,350
Yes!

13
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,180
So, if you need anything
or want to eat something...

14
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,020
please let me know.
I'll be happy to bring you...

15
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,590
anything you ask me to.

16
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,080
Same here.

17
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,720
Please ask me anything,
and I'll do my best to accommodate.

18
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,330
Me too! In the name of my sword!

19
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,910
Master, I see that you're awake.

20
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,470
- How do you do, I'm...
- It's not good.

21
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,880
You're supposed to be present
when our new Master wakes up.

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,210
Do you understand what I'm saying?

23
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,150
Yes, I understand.

24
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,150
I was worried about
our Master's health...

25
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,490
and that's why I was making
a special drink for him.

26
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,620
A drink?

27
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,990
How did you know I was thirsty?

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,590
Master!

29
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,960
- Karin!
- What?

30
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,930
Did you taste the drink yourself?

31
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,870
Why? I'm healthy,
so I don't need to drink it myself.

32
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,370
I must stop him right away.

33
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,700
What's wrong with her?

34
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,650
Master!

35
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,190
What do we do?

36
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,260
Nadeshiko, fill up the kettle with water!

37
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,090
Ichigo, get the orange juice from the fridge!

38
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,490
Sakura, get the ice!
Tsubaki, fetch the towel!

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,430
Yes!

40
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,760
We'll help stop the pain right away.

41
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,330
What's wrong?

42
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,040
Is that because of...

43
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,430
Yes, that's right.

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,110
Don't they say,
good medicine tastes bitter?

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,150
I didn't say that the drink
was delicious, did I?

46
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,580
It's not my fault.

47
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,480
Master should've tested it
before he drank it.

48
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,020
And, it's your fault for not stopping him!

49
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,190
I shouldn't take any of the blame.

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,150
I understand!

51
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,420
I understand,
but can't you do something about it?

52
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,930
Master, you'll be okay.

53
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,910
Good. He's better now.

54
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,280
I finally feel better.

55
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,140
I'm glad, master.

56
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,650
- You might be glad, but...
- What's the matter, Master?

57
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,820
I don't remember
anything about myself.

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,250
I think it's amnesia.

59
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,820
That might be it.

60
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,890
I guess your name is Akio.

61
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,690
Before you arrived...

62
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,200
I asked my crystal ball
who'd be our next Master.

63
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,400
It said it was Akio.

64
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,540
Reading your crystal ball again?

65
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,510
We can't really count on
that being his name then.

66
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,240
Nadeshiko, your fortune telling
has never proved to be true.

67
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,410
You're right, but...

68
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,550
That's fine. Akio's going to be fine now.

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,660
I believe you've temporarily
lost your memory.

70
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,790
I'm sure you'll gradually
remember everything, Master.

71
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,530
Somehow, I know this isn't the place.

72
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,130
Please tell me, what is this
place I'm at, anyway?

73
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,800
I'm really confused about everything.

74
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,440
I suppose you want to know, Master...

75
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,050
the geological location of this place.

76
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,050
Unfortunately, we don't have
the answer for you.

77
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,560
This place is everywhere
and nowhere at the same time.

78
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,460
That's all we can tell you.

79
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,490
A parallel world,
what does that mean?

80
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,760
You can analyze it
however way you want.

81
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,630
But, everyone who comes here has a reason.

82
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,440
And our existence does, too.

83
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,510
As soon as all your unresolved,
personal problems are fixed...

84
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,150
you can go back to your own world.

85
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,780
To assist you with that process,
we maids are here for you.

86
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,810
Even if it kills me, I'll help you, Master,
to go back to your own world.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,150
I promise.

88
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,720
Why don't you take your time
and think about it, Master.

89
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,500
That's how I began to live
in this house with the strange maids.

90
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,960
A dream. I wonder who it was.

91
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,810
- Come in.
- Good morning!

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,950
Master, I brought you a perfect
blend of herbal tea to wake you up.

93
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,640
This one is made from the freshest herbs,
soaked in cold water from the well...

94
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,190
and steeped under the morning sun.

95
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,630
Today, I mixed chamomile,
lemon balm, spearmint and rose.

96
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,230
Please have some.

97
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,520
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

98
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,300
You don't need to worry, Master.

99
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,470
It's not like the one from yesterday.
I'm pretty good with herbs, you know.

100
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,770
Delicious!

101
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,640
I'm so glad you like it.

102
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,680
More, please.

103
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,020
There's this spot behind the woods where
you can find a lot of fresh herbs.

104
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,220
Would you like to come
with me to pick some before breakfast?

105
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,560
It's my secret spot
which no one else knows about.

106
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,600
Master, you're special, so I'll show you.

107
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,100
We can have a tea
with the fresh herbs we pick.

108
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,430
Since that morning,
it became my daily routine...

109
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,030
to go out and pick the herbs
with Karin every morning.

110
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,440
It was refreshing and a lot of fun.

111
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,610
For me, without my memory...

112
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,410
this has become a very special time.

113
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,920
Fully relaxing.

114
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,730
What's wrong?

115
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,890
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

116
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,640
Yes!

117
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,240
Why don't you eat with me?

118
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,350
We're just your maids, Master.

119
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,720
We have ours in a separate room,
aft you're done with your dinner.

120
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,010
That's right.

121
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,050
So, you're just going to watch
me eat like that?

122
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,350
Does that bother you?

123
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,320
It would be really nice
if you'd sit down and eat with me.

124
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,420
It would make it more fun for all of us.

125
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,540
You've got to be kidding.
We can eat with you?

126
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,140
Please don't joke like that.

127
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,630
But, we're meant to serve you, Master.

128
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,500
How could we dare eat with you?

129
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,140
Nadeshiko, you're so uptight.

130
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,480
Our Master's telling us to do it.

131
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,080
Aren't we supposed to obey
our Master's orders no matter what?

132
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,890
Right, Suzuran?

133
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,360
Yes, that's true.

134
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,360
I suppose we can share
the dinner table with him.

135
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,890
All right!

136
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,970
Thanks, Suzuran.

137
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,870
She's really sensitive to my needs.

138
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,710
Nadeshiko, fill up the kettle with water!

139
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,540
Ichigo, get the orange juice from the fridge!

140
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,950
Sakura, get the ice!
Tsubaki, fetch the towel!

141
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,380
Suzuran, could she
be in love with our master?

142
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,780
Why do I care about that?
It doesn't matter.

143
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,220
I shouldn't care about the feelings of others.

144
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,980
- You okay?
- Yes.

145
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,150
Watch your step.

146
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,570
Master! This is where I come in handy!

147
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,530
The power of the sword!

148
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,930
That was very good.

149
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,850
How could you,
after I told you to watch your step.

150
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,110
And Tsubaki, there was
no need for the sword.

151
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,410
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,250
That was bad, I know.

153
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,290
You know the punishment.

154
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,480
Yes.

155
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,720
No need to punish them.
These two meant well.

156
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,160
If we start punishing
for small mistakes like that...

157
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,030
They'll be no end.

158
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,860
Master?

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
The case is closed.

160
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,140
Let me go and continue with my book.

161
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,210
You two, you know why you're here.

162
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,350
Yes Master.

163
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,290
Then hurry up and come over here.

164
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,480
Please punish us for our mistake today.

165
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,820
We're ready to accept
the consequences of our actions.

166
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,660
You two, I expect you to obey
the words of your Master.

167
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,670
Yes.

168
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,170
Without reservation.

169
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,720
It feels so good!

170
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,500
- Feels so good!
- It's fantastic.

171
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,950
It's a punishment.

172
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,510
I made a yummy-looking cake.

173
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,090
Master please. Please punish me more!

174
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,080
Are you ready?

175
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,530
I can't take it!

176
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,730
Insert your stiff part into me!

177
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,870
- Me too!
- All right, I will.

178
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,650
Master, you're so incredible!

179
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,820
I can't take it anymore.

180
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,430
Not yet. You must come when I do.

181
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,560
I'm coming!

182
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,210
Don't even imagine that
your punishment is over.

183
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,210
I just got going.

184
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,010
Understood.

185
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,780
What was that? Was it a dream?

186
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,540
Good morning.

187
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,270
Good morning, Master.

188
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,030
Master, you're up early this morning.
I hope you slept well.

189
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,500
Yeah.

190
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,170
Is anything the matter?

191
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,910
No, nothing.

192
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,280
Master, good morning.

193
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,180
What a nice morning it is.
Don't you think so?

194
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,650
- I think it is.
- Yes, indeed.

195
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,320
That was a dream after all.

196
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,190
But I wonder when I'll get my memory back.

197
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,490
I don't remember a thing
about the world I've come from.

198
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,860
But I want to return anyway.

199
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,400
I think it'll be better if I do.

200
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,900
This is a very comfortable
place to live in, but<i>...</i>

201
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,690
All I remember is that girl.

202
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,080
She's probably someone
I cared about before I came here.

203
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,390
Damn it!

204
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,600
Can't sleep now after
thinking about it so intensely.

205
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,100
Master. He's late.

206
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,410
What's wrong, Karin?

207
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,940
It's nothing. Let me try this.

208
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,800
Karin?

209
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,150
As I thought, you're still in bed!

210
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,650
Master, please get up!

211
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,160
It's time for us to go
and pick some herbs.

212
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,350
Please let me sleep in.

213
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,690
No, you shouldn't.
It's not good to sleep in.

214
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,270
Keeping the regular routine
is good for your health!

215
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,390
Let me, just ten minutes!

216
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,630
Or five.

217
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,270
Come on, let's go.

218
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,170
You've promised that you'd go
and pick herbs with me every morning.

219
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,970
Even though you're our Master,
you can't break a promise.

220
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,780
If you want, I'll resort to force!

221
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,850
Please don't, don't!

222
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,020
- It's not a good time.
- It is!

223
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,550
That's why I told you not to.

224
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,670
Karin, you're rather quiet this morning.

225
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,950
- Is there something wrong?
- Nothing.

226
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,980
To think of it, you didn't go
to pick herbs with our Master.

227
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,280
Really? Karin, did you get into
a fight with our Master or something?

228
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,690
Please tell me everything.

229
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,730
No, we didn't get into a fight.

230
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,860
She's right. We really didn't.

231
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,470
How dare you embarrass me.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?

232
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,470
I'm sorry. I just...

233
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,710
I didn't expect that you would...

234
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,650
I'm sick of your excuses.
You've made a big mistake.

235
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,450
One that's going to be
very hard for me to forget.

236
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,590
As your Master,
I must punish you now.

237
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,720
Understand?

238
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,090
Yes.

239
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,630
Then, suck my dick. All right?

240
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,000
I can't believe you'd leave my dick
alone after seeing how excited it is.

241
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,970
But, it was unexpected.

242
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,070
Don't bite with your teeth!

243
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,140
I'm sorry.

244
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,890
It's good.

245
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,860
Master's penis is incredible.

246
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,400
It's getting so big and hard.

247
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,440
I'm coming.

248
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,440
Master, what are you doing?

249
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,240
Here, touch me.

250
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,670
Incredible! It's already hard again.

251
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,540
It feels good. Master, please punish me.

252
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,790
Please, more, punish me!

253
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,490
Master, you're touching me,
very deep inside me!

254
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,460
The deepest part of me!

255
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,800
It feels it feels incredibly good.

256
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,560
Master!

257
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,620
It's numbing me, it feels like...

258
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,160
as if I'm melting from the inside,
it feels so good!

259
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,600
Master, this position is embarrassing!

260
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,100
- I can't...
- Shut up!

261
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,140
You'll do what your Master tells you.

262
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,250
It's good.

263
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,170
It's good! It's so good!

264
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,790
I'm sorry, it's so good!

265
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,050
It's incredible!

266
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,700
Not yet. If you thought your punishment
ends so quickly, you're mistaken.

267
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,240
No, I'm dying!

268
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,800
I can't take it anymore!

269
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,540
I can't, anymore.

270
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,240
Now, it's time to lick it clean.

271
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,840
Yes.

272
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,290
All right, I'll do you the favor as well.
Let me clean you up.

273
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,970
It's time to resume the punishment.

274
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,270
Master, it feels good!

275
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,710
It feels good master!

276
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,540
Don't stop!

277
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,820
Another weird dream again.

278
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,520
It feels strangely real,
and I am exhausted by it, too.

279
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,650
It's so good.
I've got to sleep some more.

280
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,220
Master's late again.

281
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,530
Good morning, Master.
You're still in bed again!

282
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,740
Master, please get up.

283
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,330
It's time for our daily routine
to pick the herbs.

284
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,340
You have to get up now.

285
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,840
Let me sleep in.

286
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,180
I'll have to wake him up. Master!

287
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,780
I shouldn't do this in such a rush.

288
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,450
If I force him like I did yesterday,
I'll get punished again.

289
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,390
What's that supposed to mean?

290
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,560
His thing was really big.

291
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,730
My jaw was very tired afterwards.

292
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,110
Did I really do that to the girls?

293
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,320
Am I punishing them every time
they make some mistake?

294
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,880
No, that's a dream. It can't be real.

295
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,210
But, it is real.

296
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,020
I'm not in a normal world.
Anything can happen here.

297
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,720
I unconsciously did that dirty thing
to the girls which I wouldn't normally do.

298
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,230
Although, in secret, I wanted to.

299
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,230
I did that horrible thing to them.

300
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,940
What should I do?

301
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,630
If this is left alone...

302
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,240
every time I witness them
making a mistake...

303
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,540
my true desires will take hold of me,
and I'll end up forcing them to have sex.

304
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,290
What should I do? What should I do?
