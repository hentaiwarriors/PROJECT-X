1
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,410
How could this have happened?!

2
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:28,589
That day, I truly understood
what my desires were.

3
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,429
That day, I enslaved a woman.

4
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:37,905
That day, I acquired the best
specimen I could for my experiments.

5
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:38,973
So I thought...

6
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:12,707
Um, I'd like
two cell phones, please.

7
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:29,687
Who the hell could it be?

8
00:01:32,894 --> 00:01:34,521
Wh-What are you doing here?

9
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:36,625
That's awfully cold of you.

10
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:40,027
I have material on the
third sex slave candidate.

11
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:41,526
Can I come in?

12
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:44,605
No, I'm training one right now.

13
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:47,402
Just wait a second.
We'll go somewhere else.

14
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,245
It seems like things are going
smoothly with Ren Nanase.

15
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:02,380
I suppose.

16
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:07,923
So, this one is your third
recommendation?

17
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:11,795
But you know. She doesn't
have any obvious weaknesses.

18
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,700
Then why do you want to
make her a sex nurse?

19
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:19,567
To sum it all up simply,
I just don't like her.

20
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:24,444
That blasй cheerfulness of one
who's never suffered hardship.

21
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:27,242
You sure have become
some scary woman.

22
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:34,017
Believe it or not, I can
still be quite adorable, you know.

23
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:35,555
Not here...

24
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:41,822
So you came to see me because
you don't have anything on her.

25
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,761
You can take it out, you know.

26
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:46,129
I'll lick it nice and clean for you.

27
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:47,996
What did you say?!

28
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,071
I'm thinking of going to the police
and telling them everything.

29
00:02:58,113 --> 00:03:01,105
About the mistake that led
to the death of that patient?

30
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:02,342
Yes.

31
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,611
I think that would be best.

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,183
It would be the best way for me
to make amends to that patient.

33
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:11,722
What the hell are you
talking about?

34
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:15,689
Uh, I appreciate your sincerity.

35
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:20,025
So that means you're going to tell
them about me attacking you as well?

36
00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:21,534
That's what I intend to do.

37
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,434
A misdiagnosis
and a sadist doctor, huh?

38
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,133
I guess this hospital
will be finished.

39
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:29,533
Are you still
going to the police?

40
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,239
Yes.

41
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:34,678
Oh stop. You're making me laugh.

42
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:37,274
Do you think you can really
go through with that?

43
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,512
- That's...!
- Have you forgotten?

44
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:43,250
On this very tape I hold
in my hand is a record of you...

45
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:46,418
writhing in ecstasy
as you get fucked by me.

46
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,592
You go and tell the police...

47
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:52,360
I'll send copies all
throughout the hospital.

48
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:53,456
You won't dare!

49
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,968
You're right
I don't even have to do that.

50
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:59,472
When I'm arrested, they'll
take this tape and I'm sure...

51
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:03,772
the detectives and staff at the station
will enjoy watching you perform.

52
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:11,777
No! Stop!

53
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:13,718
Oh, come on. Stop struggling.

54
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:16,256
If I give you the tape,
you're going to the police, right?

55
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,257
Then I'll go to jail.

56
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,758
This will be our last time
together.

57
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:25,161
Then, you'll give me the tape?

58
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,360
That certainly depends on
your willingness.

59
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,725
Oh, by the way...

60
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,824
that's just a copy.

61
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:32,161
What?! No way...!

62
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,470
Ow...!

63
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:47,241
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

64
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,343
No, it was my fault.
I was in a hurry.

65
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,351
Tell me, did I hurt you?

66
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:55,651
You're... Fujisawa?!

67
00:05:56,524 --> 00:06:00,016
If you'll excuse me, I have
to rush off to a meeting.

68
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:07,196
Damn.
How do I go about this?

69
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:08,530
I want the tape!

70
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:15,135
Can't you see I'm busy right now.
I'll see you later tonight.

71
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,731
Oh, dear. I did it again.

72
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,800
I'd better change clothes
right away.

73
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:47,141
Shit!

74
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:49,608
I figured I could get
something on her...

75
00:06:49,711 --> 00:06:53,044
but I'll be the one she'll have
something on if she sees me.

76
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:00,744
Coffee stains don't come
out so easily.

77
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:20,064
For one with such an innocent face,
she sure has quite the body.

78
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:31,284
Hello? Fujisawa here.

79
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:34,281
Oh, Mother?

80
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,383
You mustn't call me
while I'm working.

81
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:43,788
Yes, but this is what
Father wanted me to do.

82
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:48,862
Yes, I know that you're
against me doing this, but...

83
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:51,870
What's this "mother", anyway?

84
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:53,907
Stuck-up bitch.

85
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:59,841
But I have to think about Father
and the president's positions, too.

86
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:05,041
But it's not just a problem between
Tohtaku Pharmaceuticals and this hospital.

87
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,387
Yes.

88
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,115
But if I just stayed in the house
the way you want me to...

89
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:12,852
I'd never have the chance to learn
for myself about the real world, Mother.

90
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,485
The real world, huh?

91
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,426
Yes. It's all right.

92
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:20,297
I won't do anything that
will hurt the Fujisawa name.

93
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:25,398
Yes. I'll be returning home
on my days off.

94
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,172
Yes. All right, then.

95
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:41,288
Right. I'd better get out there
and work hard.

96
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:52,064
"Mother"...

97
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,861
"Father and president"...

98
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:58,064
"Tohtaku Pharmaceuticals"
and the "Fujisawa name"...

99
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,497
What's it all about?

100
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:02,939
Thank you, Doctor.

101
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,970
- Take care of yourself.
- I will.

102
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,553
Akiko, was that the last one?

103
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:36,201
What's the matter, Miss Nanase?

104
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,904
I'm sorry. I just don't feel well.

105
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,847
Please let me
go to the bathroom.

106
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,761
Hello? Nanase here.

107
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,491
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:01,668
Yes. A lot is coming out.

109
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,728
I have a favor to ask.

110
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,630
I want you to listen
while you feel yourself up.

111
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:14,547
Fujisawa...

112
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,644
Her home...?

113
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,380
I understand...

114
00:10:20,822 --> 00:10:24,883
Doctor! You're not supposed
to use cell phones in the hospital!

115
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:28,257
Oh, right. I'm sorry.
Well, I'll talk to you later.

116
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:36,564
Tohtaku Pharmaceuticals

117
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:47,947
Chief Executive Officer,
Soichiro Fujisawa?

118
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,237
Just as you thought, Doctor...

119
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:19,279
Miss Fujisawa's gone
back to her parents' home.

120
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:24,610
And, you say that the name
on the gate said "Soichiro Fujisawa"?

121
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,180
Yes, Doctor...!

122
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:29,415
You're absolutely sure of that?

123
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:32,693
Well, how about it?

124
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:01,277
Be careful!

125
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,186
Watch where you're going!

126
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:05,919
I'm terribly sorry.

127
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:10,054
It's Miss Fujisawa again!

128
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:11,723
Are you all right?

129
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,263
Huh?

130
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,096
Remember?

131
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:19,104
We bumped into each other
in the courtyard.

132
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,470
She's playing dumb with me.

133
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:26,673
Is she saying she doesn't want
anything to do with a lowly guy like me?

134
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:28,977
From gynecology?

135
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,210
That's right. I'm Hirasaka.

136
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:36,717
But you sure have a lot of
materials there.

137
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:41,226
Yes. They're documents for
a new drug we're testing.

138
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:46,664
We have requests for clinical tests
of a new drug from two companies.

139
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,260
A new drug, huh?

140
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:50,360
Whichever gets approved first...

141
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:53,702
Gets the whole market for itself.

142
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:55,173
Uh, yes.

143
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,767
And, what are
the two drug companies?

144
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,039
Ohtoh Pharmaceuticals and...

145
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,774
Tohtaku...

146
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,076
Pardon?

147
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:05,513
Tohtaku Pharmaceuticals.

148
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,453
And which one is all this
documentation for?

149
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:11,423
This is for Ohtoh Pharmaceuticals.

150
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:19,823
Thank you for helping me
pick these up.

151
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:23,802
It's nothing. Just make sure
you don't lose any of it.

152
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,565
Y-Yes.

153
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:38,146
How unusual.

154
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,914
It's a rare treat to be
called up to your office.

155
00:13:42,123 --> 00:13:43,147
Did you hear?

156
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,258
What?

157
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:48,522
Miss Fujisawa says she lost
one of the new drug samples.

158
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:49,596
Oh?

159
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:51,688
The whole hospital's
in a panic.

160
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,600
Miss Fujisawa's probably getting
quite a scolding from the president.

161
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,231
Sounds like you've had a bad day.

162
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:02,309
Doctor...!

163
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,275
I heard from the chief medical officer.

164
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:09,042
It's a good thing they made
it look like a shipment error.

165
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:13,216
It's quite unfortunate, Miss Fujisawa.

166
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:16,287
I know everything there is to know.

167
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:19,516
Why did you steal it?

168
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:20,616
What?

169
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,826
You're the one who stole
the new drug sample, right?

170
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,195
I did? But why would I?

171
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:29,031
Why are you getting all flustered?

172
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,763
But, I'm not!

173
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,830
I really don't know what
could have happened to it.

174
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,638
But you'd be the only one who'd know.

175
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:40,737
That the samples received
from Ohtoh Pharmaceuticals...

176
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:43,942
were fully accounted for
according to the receipt.

177
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,383
But I really don't know anything...

178
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:48,954
No one else but you
handled those samples...

179
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,718
from when they were first received...

180
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:54,488
to when they were put
in the pharmacy cabinet.

181
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,927
But when the pharmacist
opened up the cabinet...

182
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:59,226
one of them was gone.

183
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,395
No matter how you work it...

184
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,369
I can't think of any
other culprit but you.

185
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:05,905
But that can't be.

186
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,668
First of all, I don't have a reason...

187
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,338
You don't?!

188
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:14,479
You have a perfect motive
for what you did...

189
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:15,810
Ako Fujisawa.

190
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:20,410
Or should I refer to you as the
heiress of Tohtaku Pharmaceuticals?

191
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:21,783
How did you know?!

192
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:27,452
You stole a rival company's sample
for your dad, or rather, your "Father"!

193
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,552
- No!
- I suppose I can't blame you.

194
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:32,962
After all, if Ohtoh beats
Tohtaku to market with it...

195
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:36,400
the loss to Tohtaku
would be no small fortune.

196
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:38,495
But, I really...

197
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:41,632
Do you have any proof that I stole it?

198
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,165
Proof?

199
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,940
Then, how about we go and
take a look in your locker?

200
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,179
This is my locker.

201
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,844
I want you to open it yourself.

202
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,215
Uh, sure...

203
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:02,484
What's the matter?

204
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:05,121
H-How did it get there...?

205
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:06,991
Get out of my way!

206
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,899
What's this?

207
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,331
So, you did have it after all.

208
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:16,808
But I... But I don't know anything!

209
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:21,142
I guess this'll be the end
of the great Tohtaku Pharmaceuticals.

210
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:25,975
To think they'd use the heiress as
an industrial spy in the guise of a nurse.

211
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:29,613
I'd say you'll probably be
charged with larceny.

212
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,887
I'm sure the media will be
all over this one.

213
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:39,093
Don't panic!

214
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,236
You don't want anyone else
to know about this, right?

215
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:44,504
No.

216
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:48,166
Then come to my examination room tonight.

217
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,436
We can talk about
what you can do.

218
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:51,511
Sure.

219
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:57,415
Now, take it. You'll relax.

220
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,553
But I really didn't do anything.

221
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:03,521
It's not about whether you did it or not.

222
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:05,956
It's about how people are going to see it.

223
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,084
Come on. Drink up.

224
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,866
But, what am I supposed to do?

225
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,402
What do you mean?

226
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:20,406
Huh? You wanted to talk
about what I should...

227
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,922
Sedatives made by Tohtaku
sure work every time.

228
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:08,880
I see you've come to.

229
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:11,082
D-Doctor! What are you doing?!

230
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:12,823
It's an examination.

231
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:17,020
Does it hurt that much?

232
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:18,621
It really hurts!

233
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:22,429
I'll give you a special examination.

234
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:25,565
Oh, I see what's the matter. This must hurt.

235
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:27,402
You'll need treatment.

236
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:30,942
Stop!

237
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:36,172
Is it better now?

238
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,649
No!

239
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:40,342
Take it out!

240
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,715
You want me to take it out
that much, huh?

241
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:45,189
Please! Take it out quickly!

242
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,625
All right. I'll oblige to
your request.

243
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:56,968
Wha...?!

244
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,666
Please, no!

245
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:04,507
It hurts!

246
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,808
Stop!

247
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,952
If you don't want anyone
knowing about your secret...

248
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:18,821
you come and help with
my experiments in three days.

249
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:26,091
Doctor?

250
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,395
Come right in.

251
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:35,341
I feel bad about what I did
to you the other day.

252
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:36,965
Any pain?

253
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,847
- Please forgive me.
- But I can't...

254
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:43,439
I fell in love with you
the moment I saw you.

255
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,212
This was the only way
for a lowly guy like me...

256
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,314
to take a woman of your standing
and make her mine.

257
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:55,719
Is this for real?

258
00:19:55,829 --> 00:20:00,289
Talk about naive and not knowing
anything about the real world.

259
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,328
Um...

260
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:09,735
Talk about naive and gullible.

261
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:17,636
Candidate 4

262
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:22,148
