1
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:53,942
That's...

2
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,213
Daisuke Karino...

3
00:00:58,317 --> 00:00:59,614
...and Sister Yumiko?

4
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:02,014
Yuki, I regret to inform you...

5
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:07,218
...that my St. Michaela Project
has failed due to the uprising.

6
00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:10,591
To save Japan, I've joined
the special attack unit...

7
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,561
...and am set to leave for
Okinawa tomorrow.

8
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,598
Daisuke...

9
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:24,008
The fate of our empire will be
decided upon this mission.

10
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:27,578
I have formed this special
attack unit...

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,080
...to carry out a most heroic act
of courage.

12
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:34,176
You must promote the tradition
of the glorious Royal Navy.

13
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:38,121
Be an example of honor for
the next generation to follow.

14
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:40,715
Wipe out all of the enemy fleet!

15
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:43,660
Thereby building the foundation
of an immortal empire!

16
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:58,105
This is the end of Daisuke
Karino? But... how on earth?

17
00:01:58,511 --> 00:01:59,409
Kumi.

18
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,574
Who's there?

19
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:07,077
Kumi Aoike of St. Michaela's
College...

20
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:14,124
Now, at last, I shall avenge
Daisuke's death!!

21
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:15,776
Kumi!

22
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,083
- Why?
- Who did it?

23
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:27,549
It's horrible.

24
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:41,403
Miss Yuki...

25
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:43,065
Right now, I am Aaron.

26
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:47,176
You killed Kumi Aoike, didn't you?

27
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,143
I did.

28
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,772
I hope you're not planning
to kill Aiko. Are you?

29
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:54,247
Not so loud! Come.

30
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:02,091
Rika Ikeda.

31
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,556
You seem to have forgotten
you're living on my terms.

32
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,426
I could easily banish you
here and now.

33
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:12,003
Please spare me that, Miss Yuki!

34
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:13,836
Strip down.

35
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:21,671
Let me get it through to your
body that you're my servant!

36
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:02,081
Aiko...

37
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:07,821
You'll let me have your body but
your soul is reserved for Aiko.

38
00:06:08,294 --> 00:06:12,492
Miss Yuki, if you kill Aiko...

39
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:13,496
Then what?

40
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,564
I will commit murder-suicide
right here.

41
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:22,638
Don't worry. I don't plan to
do Aiko any harm whatsoever.

42
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:27,441
My objective is to send
the Crusade to Jerusalem.

43
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:38,612
No...

44
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:50,635
Stop...

45
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,486
Send the Crusade to Jerusalem?

46
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:14,582
Then why do you oppose my fellows
from St. Michaela's?

47
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:16,786
Their objective is the same.

48
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:19,825
Quiet! It's just...

49
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:21,094
Yes?

50
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,434
Just as you love Aiko, I, too,
have someone I love.

51
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,174
Go on. We're leaving tomorrow.

52
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:31,334
Yes...

53
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:48,450
Daisuke...

54
00:07:57,236 --> 00:07:58,703
Yuki...

55
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:02,433
Before my departure, I'd like
us to have a wedding...

56
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:06,804
Daisuke...

57
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:13,709
Daisuke...

58
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,090
DAISUKE!!

59
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:37,032
If only Aiko Mimura hadn't
come to St. Michaela's,

60
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,736
my dear Daisuke would not
have died...

61
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,404
All I have to do is kill Hans.

62
00:08:42,514 --> 00:08:45,005
Then he can't reincarnate
as Aiko Mimura.

63
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:47,642
Nor can he come into our time.

64
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:50,885
Please wait, Daisuke...

65
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,620
I'll do everything in my power
to protect your life.

66
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:06,028
Miss Yuki intends to kill Hans.

67
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:10,040
I must do something, or Hans...
rather, or Aiko's life will...

68
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:11,138
Lord...

69
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:17,113
Please guide us safely to
the Holy Land, Jerusalem...

70
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,839
That voice... Hans?

71
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:20,418
I must tell him.

72
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,478
If we're destined to unite,
I shall swallow my shame...

73
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,957
...and use my body to...

74
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,724
...so that the wind will be
calm over the ocean.

75
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,698
Lord, keep your loving hand
of guidance upon our journey.

76
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,800
Amen.

77
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:41,438
Hans.

78
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:45,241
You are... Rika Ikeda.

79
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:49,246
What are you doing
looking like that?!

80
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:54,283
One of my fellows has died...
a woman named Kumi Aoike.

81
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:55,820
What?!

82
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:58,754
What is happening to us will
happen to you as well.

83
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:02,293
Our Crusade has become one with
your Crusade.

84
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,954
Someone is also targeting you.

85
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:07,293
What are you driving at?

86
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:10,525
Will you cancel the expedition?

87
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:12,330
Not again...

88
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:15,601
I've told you.
I have a mission to accomplish.

89
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:19,941
About a year ago, someone stood
at my bedside and said:

90
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:22,445
"Go to Jerusalem."

91
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:24,209
I believed I heard the Lord.

92
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:26,775
Do you believe in the Lord?

93
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,550
It is you, Hans, that I want
to believe in.

94
00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:31,645
Me?

95
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:35,824
You've taught me a way of living
that I had not imagined.

96
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,954
When? I've only just met you!

97
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:40,497
But we have met before.

98
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:44,399
To be precise, we will meet
hundreds of years from now.

99
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:46,733
We were lovers.

100
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:50,369
Do you mean to tell me you've
come backwards in time?!

101
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:54,344
Yes. I don't blame you for
not believing me.

102
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,609
But I did fall in love
for the first time... with you.

103
00:10:57,716 --> 00:10:58,910
Love?

104
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:02,385
We even pledged our love once,
like this...

105
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:11,195
If this is fate... our destiny...

106
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:15,357
your body will know that I am
telling you the truth.

107
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:16,997
It's immoral!

108
00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:20,205
With unspoiled purity
as our shield...

109
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:24,207
we the Crusade must rise up and
proceed toward the Holy Land.

110
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,207
How dare you!!

111
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,904
I will protect your life
with my own!

112
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:29,105
Get out, you filth.

113
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:31,409
Hans!

114
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:34,108
If you don't, I will!

115
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:35,413
Cover yourself!

116
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:42,985
How else can I?

117
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:01,078
What a disaster!

118
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,576
Hans and the Crusade have
already departed!

119
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:06,784
- What?!
- Why did they?!

120
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:09,249
How would I know?

121
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,878
We've got to follow them.

122
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:13,787
Everyone, get ready and gather
in 30 minutes!

123
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,475
Marco, is everything okay
with your carriage?

124
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:41,951
Hi, Hans.

125
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,387
Your order was so abrupt I just
grabbed everything and ran.

126
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:47,885
I had received a revelation
from God.

127
00:12:48,494 --> 00:12:51,327
We are protected by the Lord,
after all.

128
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:54,330
Franćois, you are supposed to be
riding way back there.

129
00:12:57,302 --> 00:13:01,534
Hey, I don't see the support
troop from Japan anywhere.

130
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,636
I'm sure they'll catch up.

131
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:08,872
There's no need for support.
We can manage fine on our own.

132
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:09,845
Right?

133
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:14,981
Recently, I've heard rumors of
bandits that prey on pilgrims.

134
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:17,417
Let them try if they dare.

135
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:22,557
We'll hand them their due
punishment, right, leader?

136
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:26,330
We'll spare no one that
stands in our way.

137
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,422
That's right!!

138
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,371
What's that?

139
00:13:39,845 --> 00:13:40,470
What happened?

140
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:42,043
Bandits!

141
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,141
Get them, bums!

142
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,827
No! Stop!

143
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:02,896
No!

144
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:07,303
Franćois!!

145
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:09,834
Shit! Stop it!

146
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,739
No! Stop!

147
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:15,744
Beast! No!

148
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:30,424
Please stop.

149
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:33,458
Lord...

150
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:39,404
Shit!

151
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:40,570
Charge!!

152
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,368
What?

153
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:47,045
That's the support troop
from St. Michaela's.

154
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:52,039
Don't underestimate us ladies!

155
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:53,782
We're the Female Crusade...

156
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:56,479
...the veterans of a hundred
conquests...

157
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:58,522
...who wiped out the warlords!

158
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:22,939
Aiko!

159
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:24,409
Mayumi.

160
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:28,316
We just missed them. The Crusade
left early this morning.

161
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:29,982
Kozue's group also?

162
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:32,486
They were led by Hans Heilner.

163
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:34,390
Aiko, that's you...

164
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:39,587
Let's go. I know the route
they're taking to Marseilles.

165
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,689
To Marseilles!

166
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:44,165
To Marseilles!!

167
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:56,406
You're here at last, Aiko...
No, Hans!

168
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:36,850
Hans...

169
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:40,683
Leave me alone...

170
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:47,191
Franćois!!

171
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:50,059
What?

172
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,133
How awful!

173
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:04,108
Don't just stand there!
Take her down!

174
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:05,939
Give her a burial!

175
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:11,044
It is against the Lord's word
to take your own life.

176
00:17:11,523 --> 00:17:14,583
Hans, do you still believe
in the Lord?

177
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:19,592
Trials are also God's will.

178
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,598
We shall overcome all obstacles.

179
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,397
The Holy Land, Jerusalem, shall
indeed be ours!!

180
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:41,414
Are you alright, Marco?

181
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,514
Yeah...

182
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:44,980
You're burning up!

183
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,785
Hans!

184
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:57,626
How's Marco?

185
00:17:58,336 --> 00:17:59,894
We can't get his fever down.

186
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:03,771
Misayo is making an herbal remedy
with river water.

187
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:05,506
Thank you.

188
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:21,015
It's amazing how you predicted
the fever that's ailing Marco.

189
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:22,623
Rika?

190
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,853
This is Aaron.

191
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:28,990
He's been sent directly
by the Pope to aid Hans.

192
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:35,038
Perhaps you are God's messengers
capable of prophecy?

193
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:39,403
Oh, no. Nothing like that.
We've denied God's existence.

194
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:40,671
Right?

195
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,678
Right...

196
00:18:42,981 --> 00:18:45,677
Okay, it's done.
Just enough for now.

197
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:48,820
Rika, why don't you bring it
to them?

198
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,946
Yes... May I, Misayo?

199
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:54,457
I'll be over as soon as
I make some more.

200
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,084
I've got to make enough
to get to Marseilles.

201
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:12,165
Pretty handy, huh?

202
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,804
I'm like the medic of
the St. Michaela troop.

203
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:22,785
You can save someone else's life
but I bet you can't save yours.

204
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,127
Why?

205
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:45,243
Misayo!

206
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,240
Misayo!

207
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:49,906
Look!

208
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:51,738
Misayo!

209
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:58,415
Hey, look.

210
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:04,350
Misayo.

211
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:05,755
What happened?

212
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:09,991
Misayo has been killed.
The killer is amongst you.

213
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:14,696
What? You suspect us?

214
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:18,101
Misayo said "the Crusade"
and drew her last breath.

215
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,534
What?

216
00:20:19,644 --> 00:20:23,375
Let's stop this! This is no time
to make enemies of each other.

217
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:26,473
Rika... Are you taking
their side?!

218
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:27,915
Watoko!

219
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:30,454
There is no greater insult!

220
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:33,053
Stop it, every one of you!

221
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:35,888
Marco, you should be in bed!

222
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:40,090
It's my fault. If only I hadn't
caught this fever...

223
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,597
...Misayo wouldn't have...

224
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,099
...it's all my...

225
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,133
Misayo!

226
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:46,462
Marco...

227
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:48,403
Misayo!!

228
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,314
Everyone, let's give Misayo
a proper burial.

229
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,060
So we've failed to keep them
from advancing to Marseilles.

230
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:16,428
Kumi's dead. So is Misayo.

231
00:21:17,535 --> 00:21:22,495
If we hadn't left Aiko behind,
maybe they wouldn't have died.

232
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:24,808
Watoko, what do you mean?

233
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:28,343
It's your fault, Kozue.

234
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:31,108
We should have waited for
Aiko to recover!

235
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,008
Too late now...

236
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:36,621
Kozue!!

237
00:21:37,822 --> 00:21:38,846
Punk!

238
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:50,457
There's nothing I can do
about it now, is there?!

239
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,069
Aiko...

240
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,576
Everyone, we're almost there!

241
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,946
We're not far from Marseilles.
Hang in there!!

242
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:06,676
Yeah!!

243
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:10,277
I must avert Yuki's evil plot.
Or else, I will evaporate.

244
00:22:10,388 --> 00:22:14,654
And the undivided world after
the Restoration would not come!!

245
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,066
I smell the sea breeze.

246
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:31,973
The sea...

247
00:22:32,077 --> 00:22:35,740
The sea! Hey, it's the SEA!

248
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:37,542
I can see the Mediterranean!

249
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:02,336
We finally did it! Jerusalem is
just beyond this sea.

250
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,308
God has seen us through
our journey.

251
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:09,073
Thank you, Lord. And thank you,
Kozue and fellows.

252
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:12,013
And now, you're on your own.

253
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:15,480
What? Do you still hold
a grudge against us?

254
00:23:15,987 --> 00:23:16,954
Hell, no.

255
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:19,421
The Mediterranean, I'm afraid,
will not part.

256
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:20,353
Nonsense.

257
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,085
There will be no miracle.

258
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,424
That's when you'd finally
realize you've been betrayed...

259
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,326
...by the Pope.

260
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:27,193
What?!

261
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:31,200
Rather, you've been betrayed by
the very religion you cherished.

262
00:23:31,302 --> 00:23:31,927
Liar!

263
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,402
You're going to be sold
to the slave ship!

264
00:23:34,506 --> 00:23:38,169
Waving a contract with the Pope,
the traders will take you all...

265
00:23:38,276 --> 00:23:39,208
...to Africa!

266
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:41,278
Are you mocking us?!

267
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:42,676
I've heard enough!

268
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:44,110
Stop it!!

269
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,409
We must pray.

270
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:47,815
A miracle will happen.
The sea will part.

271
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,216
We will get to the Holy Land.

272
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,188
As long as we believe in Him,
the Lord will hear us...

273
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,191
...and answer our prayers!

274
00:23:57,662 --> 00:24:00,028
That's right! Hans is right!!

275
00:24:01,032 --> 00:24:02,329
Let's pray.

276
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:05,559
Our Father who art in heaven...

277
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,934
Our Father who art in heaven...

278
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,974
We the Crusaders have come here...

279
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,169
...to take back Holy Jerusalem
from the heathens.

280
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,682
Lord, please open our way
through the Mediterranean.

281
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:20,883
Amen.

282
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:21,815
Amen.

283
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:20,538
Look! The sea is swelling!

284
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:39,725
The sea...

285
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,298
The sea is parting...

286
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:12,428
The way to the Holy Land
has been opened.

287
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,862
Let's proceed to Jerusalem!

288
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:19,259
To Jerusalem!

289
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:22,304
Wait!!

290
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,803
Kozue, you have nothing more
to tell us.

291
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,811
The sea has parted.
The promise has been fulfilled.

292
00:26:28,913 --> 00:26:31,438
Those slave traders you feared
are nowhere in sight.

293
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:35,216
This can't be happening...
It's impossible...

294
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,118
This must be some sort of
a trickery!

295
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:39,655
Don't be deceived!!

296
00:26:40,992 --> 00:26:42,186
Listen carefully.

297
00:26:42,293 --> 00:26:46,627
These women have only pretended
to support our cause!

298
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:47,663
Aaron!

299
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:49,797
Remember what they said?

300
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:53,064
If the sea doesn't part,
it proves to us...

301
00:26:53,171 --> 00:26:56,072
...that the Pope has lied
about everything.

302
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:57,664
But the sea did part!!

303
00:26:57,775 --> 00:27:01,711
After witnessing a miracle,
why would they still deny it?

304
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:06,477
Because they are fallen angels
trying to destroy the Pope!!

305
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,108
They're the Devil's servants!!

306
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:08,878
What?!

307
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,821
Leave them to me to handle.

308
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:15,017
Hans, lead your fellows
across the sea.

309
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:22,057
Rika.

310
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,134
Let's cross the sea together.

311
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:28,505
Hers is the true faith
in the Lord.

312
00:27:29,007 --> 00:27:32,602
Let's go, everyone!
We're crossing the sea!!

313
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:34,871
Yeah!

314
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:46,546
Kozue, forgive me. I'm doing
this for Hans... no, Aiko.

315
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:47,958
Aiko.

316
00:27:58,436 --> 00:27:59,232
Watoko!

317
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,470
Eiko!

318
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,736
Kozue!

319
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,069
What about Kumi and Misayo?

320
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:12,949
All wiped out... most likely...

321
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:14,915
Can't be...

322
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:23,155
Yuki... I presume?

323
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:27,254
Right. I've been waiting for you,
Aiko Mimura.

324
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:32,098
You would disrupt the peaceful
flow of time just for one man?

325
00:28:32,203 --> 00:28:34,194
I wouldn't expect you
to understand...

326
00:28:34,305 --> 00:28:35,738
You intend to resurrect...

327
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,934
...the dreadful Michaela Project
once again?

328
00:28:39,043 --> 00:28:41,409
I wouldn't expect
the Michaela Project.

329
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:47,150
What you're trying to do is
to recall the dark history...

330
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:50,414
...on behalf of Daisuke Karino,
is it not?

331
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:51,579
Which means...

332
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,816
Daisuke belongs to me alone.

333
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:56,257
I will keep him from going
to St. Michaela's.

334
00:28:56,427 --> 00:28:58,657
That is impossible.

335
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:02,557
In any case, it doesn't matter
what you do.

336
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:05,568
The uprising at St. Michaela's
will be a springboard...

337
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,901
to the Amakusa Restoration, then
the World Restoration here.

338
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:11,907
Eventually, Daisuke Karino is
doomed to disappear...

339
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:13,840
...in the tide of a new history.

340
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:17,312
On the contrary!
It's you who will disappear!

341
00:29:52,884 --> 00:29:53,816
Kill them!

342
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,058
Aiko!

343
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:05,686
They're not who they used to be!

344
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,892
They're just zombies manipulated
by Yuki's voodoo!

345
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:15,002
Kozue!

346
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:17,401
Kill or be killed.

347
00:30:17,508 --> 00:30:19,840
It's no use fighting back.

348
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,022
Iwadate!!

349
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,892
Mayumi!!

350
00:30:39,363 --> 00:30:42,332
Now, Aiko Mimura, you're
the only one left!!

351
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:44,731
Be a good friend and follow
the others to hell!

352
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,028
So that's it!

353
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:00,642
Try manipulating them now!

354
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:01,683
Why, you!

355
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:06,415
Aaron!

356
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:09,118
Aaron!

357
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:16,297
Aaron!

358
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:17,691
Are you all right?

359
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:19,429
We got worried, so we came back.

360
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:24,502
Pierre... Johann...
Marco... Michel...

361
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:26,767
Who are you?

362
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:30,243
Guys! It's me, Hans!

363
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,373
Pierre, Johann, Marco, Michel...

364
00:31:36,153 --> 00:31:37,017
Rika?

365
00:31:38,623 --> 00:31:39,521
Aiko...

366
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:42,992
I didn't know you were alive...

367
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:46,962
There she is. I'm finally seeing
Aiko again...

368
00:31:47,064 --> 00:31:47,860
Rika.

369
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:48,897
Aiko.

370
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:51,199
Everyone!

371
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:55,966
She is the leader of the Devil's
support troop, Aiko Mimura!

372
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:59,075
Destroy the Devil!

373
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:04,839
Stop! Don't do it!

374
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:06,246
I don't want to fight you!!

375
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:10,119
Shut up and fight!

376
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:12,385
Michel!

377
00:32:13,157 --> 00:32:15,887
Fine! I'll just have to knock
you out awhile.

378
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:24,428
Hans!

379
00:32:24,535 --> 00:32:27,299
Johann! Marco! Pierre! Michel!

380
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:28,337
Hans!

381
00:32:29,607 --> 00:32:32,132
Johann! Marco! Pierre! Michel!

382
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:36,276
Hans, let me explain!

383
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:38,447
Did you do this?

384
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:41,243
Who are you?

385
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:43,416
I'm Hans Heilner.

386
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:45,054
That's me!

387
00:32:45,222 --> 00:32:46,746
You are me.

388
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,756
The Devil!

389
00:32:49,393 --> 00:32:50,291
Stop!

390
00:32:50,394 --> 00:32:53,124
You mustn't hurt me.
It'll be a catastrophe!

391
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:58,567
Please, Hans.
She is your own self.

392
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:12,371
You are!!

393
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:22,249
Aiko!!

394
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:24,259
Aiko!!

395
00:33:27,331 --> 00:33:28,263
Aiko!!

396
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,101
I did it! I did it at last!!

397
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:40,734
I destroyed Aiko Mimura!!

398
00:33:41,912 --> 00:33:45,814
Daisuke... I'll fly over to you
right away.

399
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,821
Daisuke...

400
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,825
Here I am, Yuki.

401
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:08,229
Daisuke.

402
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,332
So we finally meet again.

403
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:13,808
735 years from now,

404
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:17,813
I shall live out my life with you...

405
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:20,039
That is impossible.

406
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:22,745
I have sunken to the bottom
of the southern sea.

407
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:25,378
No, you won't die this time.

408
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:28,481
We can go back to the time
before our wedding.

409
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,921
It's impossible, Yuki.

410
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,258
There... Look at that...

411
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:40,734
But that's?!

412
00:34:40,938 --> 00:34:43,964
Yes, the World Restoration
has begun...

413
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,274
The World Restoration?

414
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:49,939
You're not Daisuke!
Who are you?!

415
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:54,884
It's me.

416
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:56,550
My dear!

417
00:34:57,455 --> 00:34:59,719
Then, Daisuke...

418
00:35:00,424 --> 00:35:02,915
Daisuke Karino has disappeared.

419
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:06,394
Now that the World Restoration
has become a reality,

420
00:35:06,497 --> 00:35:10,160
his existence has no place
in this particular space and time.

421
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:13,236
I can stop this vile
World Restoration!

422
00:35:13,337 --> 00:35:14,269
Yuki!

423
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:43,099
Your Holiness! You're unharmed!

424
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,724
You're... Aaron!!

425
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:47,997
I see, this is your doing!

426
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:49,966
What do you mean?!

427
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:54,166
The Crusade headed for Jerusalem
has returned to attack us...

428
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:58,180
...because of a contract they
found on some slave dealers ship.

429
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:02,844
This must be some sort of
conspiracy that you instigated!

430
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:06,249
I tell you, he is an androgyny.

431
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:07,619
He's a Devil's messenger!

432
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,627
What are you?

433
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:16,431
Stop it!

434
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,296
An androgyny!

435
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:22,972
We mustn't keep it alive.

436
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,774
We must kill it!

437
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,044
Why, you wretched creatures!

438
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:31,410
You should all burn in Hell.

439
00:36:44,595 --> 00:36:45,994
Forgive me.

440
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:49,658
Please don't kill me.

441
00:36:50,434 --> 00:36:54,131
Please spare my life! I beg you!

442
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:04,145
Die!!

443
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:16,685
Devil...

444
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,023
Ridiculous. It is you who will
end up in Hell.

445
00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:40,550
The Restoration has been
completed.

446
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:42,012
That voice!

447
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:45,388
Old Sage... You were alive.

448
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:50,689
You've just done it yourself,
dear Yuki.

449
00:37:50,794 --> 00:37:53,888
Now you've completed
the Restoration.

450
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:56,723
What do you mean, Old Sage?

451
00:37:57,234 --> 00:38:01,603
All the events were preordained,
Yuki...

452
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:04,037
...from the founding of
St. Michaela's College...

453
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:05,540
...to the student uprising...

454
00:38:05,643 --> 00:38:08,203
...as well as the Amakusa
Restoration...

455
00:38:08,312 --> 00:38:10,610
...all the way to
the World Restoration.

456
00:38:10,714 --> 00:38:14,741
All played a fateful part
in the history of this world.

457
00:38:19,189 --> 00:38:22,124
Now, now, Yuki. Try to remember.

458
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:27,528
How peaceful and plentiful was
the post-Restoration world...

459
00:38:38,475 --> 00:38:39,908
But for Daisuke...

460
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:42,743
Don't be foolish.

461
00:38:42,846 --> 00:38:47,044
Those who are tied to the dark
history are doomed to perish.

462
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:50,945
But, Old Sage, your explanation
doesn't convince me!

463
00:38:52,856 --> 00:38:54,687
Yayoi... You were alive?!

464
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:59,058
Aiko Mimura! Rika Ikeda!
No way...

465
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:02,132
No way! This is ludicrous!

466
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,433
Miss Yuki, even you can't
touch Hans-Aiko now.

467
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:12,372
I have become one with Hans
completely...

468
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:16,412
...thanks to Rika and Yayoi
over there.

469
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,448
We, too, have been rescued
by Yayoi.

470
00:39:20,551 --> 00:39:23,748
Somehow, I don't remember ever
being killed, though.

471
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:28,485
Well, I had to tweak back time
a little, you know.

472
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,860
Old Sage, who on earth
are you two?

473
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:38,129
Yuki, you even forgot that, too?

474
00:39:39,436 --> 00:39:40,425
Yuki...

475
00:39:41,038 --> 00:39:42,062
My dear!

476
00:39:43,741 --> 00:39:45,470
Come on, Yuki. Try to remember.

477
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:47,908
Remember those who have lived...

478
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,980
...deep within the dark and
oppressed history.

479
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:53,007
Gonza!

480
00:39:53,484 --> 00:39:54,974
But your appearance!

481
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,788
Indeed, Gonza has reincarnated
for the better.

482
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:03,087
He is precisely the one true
symbol of the World Restoration.

483
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:09,393
I suppose it's time now for me
to make claims on your life.

484
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:11,764
Old Sage!

485
00:40:13,737 --> 00:40:17,366
"Time, be still.
You are beautiful."

486
00:40:17,474 --> 00:40:22,036
Don't say you don't remember
our pact we made that day.

487
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:28,778
But I have yet to meet Daisuke.

488
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:34,186
Yuki, just like Indra's net, all
the worlds are held together...

489
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:37,590
...by the reflections they cast
on each other.

490
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,524
Now that we have fulfilled
our mission...

491
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:43,293
there's no need for us
to stay in this world.

492
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,595
You can understand... no?

493
00:40:46,503 --> 00:40:51,406
But... I want to... have to
see Daisuke...

494
00:40:52,943 --> 00:40:54,376
Old Sage, brace yourself.

495
00:40:55,946 --> 00:40:56,742
Yuki!

496
00:40:59,716 --> 00:41:03,652
Damn you, Aiko Mimura!
Still won't get out of my way?!

497
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:11,221
Rika!

498
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:16,964
I protected the one I love
in the end...

499
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:19,695
Aiko, I love you.

500
00:41:20,537 --> 00:41:21,469
RIKA!

501
00:41:28,712 --> 00:41:30,509
This is the end of you, Yuki!

502
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:42,791
Daisuke, I'm coming to you now.

503
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:50,298
Time, be still.
You are beautiful.

504
00:42:15,259 --> 00:42:16,089
Daisuke!

505
00:42:16,693 --> 00:42:17,523
Yuki!

506
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:22,329
Daisuke... Here we are at last!

507
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:24,826
We shall be together forever.

508
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:26,867
Rika!!

509
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,493
Rika...

510
00:42:30,073 --> 00:42:33,201
Aiko...

511
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,235
Rika, hold on!

512
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:38,274
I'll ask Yayoi for medicine...

513
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:41,946
You don't have to.

514
00:42:42,052 --> 00:42:48,981
Now that Yuki is gone, my second
life, too, is about to expire.

515
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:53,357
I have no regrets.

516
00:42:54,331 --> 00:42:58,893
There is no greater joy
than to die in your arms.

517
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:07,067
Rika, my heart will always
belong to you alone.

518
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,371
I'm happy.

519
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:21,552
Rika?

520
00:43:24,127 --> 00:43:25,754
RIKA!!

521
00:44:00,564 --> 00:44:04,022
I won't forget you,
I promise, Rika.

522
00:44:04,134 --> 00:44:05,761
As long as this world goes on...

523
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:10,272
you'll keep on living
in my heart forever.

524
00:44:12,676 --> 00:44:13,665
Forever.

525
00:44:15,412 --> 00:44:17,471
Come on, here we go!

526
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:18,909
Yeah!
