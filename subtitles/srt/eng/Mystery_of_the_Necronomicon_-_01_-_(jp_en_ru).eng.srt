1
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,270
NECRONOMICON 730 A.D.
This is the path of an evil book...

2
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:26,043
written by Abdul Alhazard
in Damascus.

3
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,052
This book is described as being
very complicated and mysterious...

4
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:30,680
containing the secrets of magic...

5
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:34,054
But it is also known to carry
the very essence of evil.

6
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,484
The greatest book ever
on the path of evil.

7
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:38,519
It's considered the king
of all books of magic.

8
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:40,462
Therefore in 1050 A.D.,

9
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:45,001
Archbishop Michael of Byzantine had
the book condemned and sealed forever.

10
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:48,665
So we believe that the book does not
exist, intact, anywhere in the world...

11
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:25,833
What's going on?
What's happened?

12
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:48,361
Th... that dream again...

13
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:05,143
Oh no, brother... I mean chief,
you still didn't change yet?

14
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:10,651
Since vacations are rare for us,
we have to enjoy it as much as we can.

15
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,124
I don't think we'll ever have
the opportunity again...

16
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:20,461
to stay in this kind
of a resort condo.

17
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,760
I really appreciate your friend who
gave us a free vacation at this place!
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

18
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,701
What's wrong, Chief?

19
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,437
You look pale.

20
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:38,647
It's nothing.
I just had a bad dream.

21
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:42,284
That dream again? About 6 years ago,
when you got involved with something...
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

22
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,585
that caused you to lose your memory.

23
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,788
You're almost right.

24
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,116
Almost right?

25
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:50,020
Hey!

26
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:51,324
You should go see...

27
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,125
a doctor.

28
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:56,928
Yes, this is Suzusaki.

29
00:02:58,837 --> 00:02:59,804
Who is it?

30
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,230
It's Ms. Shizui.

31
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,464
I don't like dealing with her.

32
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:06,677
Hello?
This is he.

33
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:10,113
What's wrong Satoshi?
Your voice sounds gloomy.

34
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,244
No, it's nothing.

35
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:15,650
How is it?

36
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:19,721
Are you enjoying the accommodations
I arranged for you and your daughter?

37
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,158
Mina, she's not my daughter anymore.

38
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,529
I ended the adoption when
she turned 20 years old.

39
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:28,361
Oh, is that so?

40
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,669
That could be dangerous.

41
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:32,893
Dangerous?

42
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:37,071
Yes, because it means you guys
aren't related to each other now.

43
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:41,237
It means you're just
a man and a woman.

44
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,575
I thought by the way she looks
at you, you were somehow...

45
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,079
What do you want?!

46
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,479
Are you angry? How cute!

47
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,587
I want you to pay me the same
price for the information...
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

48
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,717
like you did the last time.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

49
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:57,220
I'll be arriving there in the
afternoon, the day after tomorrow.

50
00:03:57,396 --> 00:03:58,294
I see.

51
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:01,593
Let's have a nice time together.

52
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:07,769
What were you
talking about?

53
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:08,773
Work.

54
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:10,835
She said she'd come over here
the day after tomorrow.

55
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:12,610
Work?

56
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:14,836
Aren't we here for a vacation?

57
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,541
Well, that's true...

58
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,873
Stop... stop it!

59
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:22,745
Let's go!

60
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:24,955
W... wait, Chief!

61
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,885
Hey! We were still talking!

62
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,155
Chief...

63
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,961
I wanted to ask you this
for a long time.

64
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:41,670
What's going on between
you and Ms. Shizui?

65
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:43,638
What's going on?
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

66
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,276
As I told you before, she's an
excellent information broker.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

67
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,175
I can say she's the
best in the business.

68
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,280
No, I don't mean that.

69
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:53,682
Then what?

70
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:58,147
Well, about you and Ms. Shizui's...

71
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:00,149
private life.

72
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:03,926
Weren't you the one who said we should
enjoy this vacation to the fullest?

73
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,893
I don't want to deal with that
kind of question right now.

74
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:20,838
You're getting better, Asuka!

75
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:25,112
Chief, I got used to it.

76
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:27,174
Don't get carried away!
Be careful!

77
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:28,045
Yes!

78
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:42,990
Nagano Prefecture Police
<i> </i>

79
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,574
What happened?

80
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,678
What's going on?

81
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:56,874
What happened?

82
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,251
The Sato family in
40D committed suicide.

83
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:02,981
What a mess!

84
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:03,645
What?

85
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:04,980
A family suicide?

86
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:09,926
No, the manager who found them first
said they were viciously killed.

87
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:11,652
Viciously? How?

88
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,430
I don't know. He was totally pale
and he couldn't tell me the details.

89
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:17,557
Oh, no.

90
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:20,237
Asuka, go back to the room.

91
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:22,631
Chief! Chief!

92
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:26,107
Oh, well.
He's always very curious.

93
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:36,283
Oh, excuse me.

94
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:37,310
Pardon me.

95
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:45,455
Hey!

96
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:46,589
Working hard?

97
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:48,763
Who are you?

98
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:50,892
This area is closed to the public.

99
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:56,567
Please excuse me.
You're from the Central Office?

100
00:06:57,776 --> 00:06:59,971
Well, what happened?

101
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:01,668
A murder.

102
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,072
But... the cause of
death is very strange.

103
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,408
All four family members died
after their eyeballs were gouged out.

104
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,626
Are you all right, Terada?

105
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,692
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:26,966
Who are you?!

107
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:27,936
Oh, he is from the Tokyo...

108
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:29,338
I'm just a guy from Tokyo.

109
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:30,102
See you...

110
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,272
What?!

111
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,507
You lied to me!

112
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,936
I didn't say anything.

113
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:39,444
Mr. Hotokeu...

114
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:41,542
Something stinks about him.

115
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:46,255
Eyeballs gouged out...

116
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:53,993
Damn!

117
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,112
Well, I'm sorry I'm late.

118
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,609
It took a while to dub the tape.

119
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,021
Why did you make me come here?

120
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:25,959
You have a great body I just love.

121
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:29,158
That's not funny!

122
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:30,993
I'm leaving.

123
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,527
Wait!

124
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:37,041
You won't want to leave
after you see this.

125
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,688
Sit down!

126
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,030
Due to the approach of a
low pressure system...
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

127
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,335
there's a chance that this bad weather
will continue all day tomorrow.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

128
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,006
As a result, since we are at the
summit, our resort will likely be...

129
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:14,034
cut off from the town at
the base of the mountain.

130
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,713
Those customers who wish to leave...

131
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:25,187
please come to the front lobby
as soon as possible.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

132
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:28,021
I'm leaving, even if he
didn't tell us to go.

133
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:32,995
Yeah! I don't want to stay at a place
like this one more second...

134
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,022
after that weird murder happened.

135
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,526
Who would want to?

136
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,739
So, how many people decided to stay?

137
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,080
It seems that six rooms
stayed here including us.

138
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,787
Is that all?

139
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:58,946
Snow on the mountain comes
together during a snowstorm.

140
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:03,620
The announcement said it was
due to the snowstorm,

141
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:08,224
but the fact is that customers were
scared by the weird murder.

142
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:14,599
The only people left here are people
desperate for a vacation, like us...

143
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,698
or somebody with courage or...

144
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:18,275
...the murderer.

145
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,969
Huh?

146
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,673
I'm just joking.

147
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:25,472
If I was the murderer, I would've
already left here much earlier.

148
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:27,015
That's right.

149
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:32,149
Well, I'm going to swim in the indoor
heated pool for a little relaxation.

150
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:41,098
Hey Mr. Manager, this place
suddenly became lonely.

151
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,793
But you're staying, too?

152
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:46,629
Yeah, I haven't taken a
vacation for a long time.

153
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:52,536
If I lose this chance, I'll never
know when I could get it again.

154
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,073
If the murder hadn't happened...

155
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:59,708
I heard you were the first one
to find the murder.

156
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:01,686
You...

157
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,147
You don't have to be suspicious.

158
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:07,453
I have a private
detective office in Tokyo.

159
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:10,587
I just have a professional curiosity.

160
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:13,625
You're a private detective?

161
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:17,026
I've never seen such a
horrible thing in my life.

162
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:22,201
I already told this to the police...

163
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,839
At that time, I was bringing
the dry cleaning that Sato ordered.

164
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:36,520
But nobody answered, no matter
how many times I rang the doorbell.

165
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,812
So I gave up and was
about to leave, when...

166
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,485
Mr. Sato, I brought your dry cleaning.

167
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:46,529
Mr. Sato.

168
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:49,222
What's that smell?

169
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:52,228
Mr. Sato?!
Mr. Sato?!

170
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,504
I think I'll have nightmares
for quite a while.

171
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:29,532
Come in!

172
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:37,308
You promise?

173
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:39,242
If I stay one night...

174
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:43,118
Yes, if you do what I say,
I'll give you back the master tape.

175
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,693
Well, let's begin.

176
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:18,882
Here! Come over here and suck this.

177
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,084
What?

178
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:24,551
Or don't you mind if I put your
foolish behavior on the internet?

179
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:30,726
Is this the first time for you?

180
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:33,500
Hey, why don't you lick this?

181
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:43,412
Well, you're not bad.

182
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:46,376
Do it more quickly!

183
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:47,247
More!

184
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:01,764
Don't spill it.
Drink it all up!

185
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:08,636
What are you crying for?

186
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:13,836
The night has just started.

187
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,085
You're?

188
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:31,083
I'll return this tape to you, too.

189
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,961
This isn't fair!

190
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,300
No! Stop it! No!

191
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,430
What's next?

192
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:45,769
Why don't you show
me your ass and pussy?

193
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:47,469
You can't!

194
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,782
Open it wider!

195
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:03,416
Oh, it's wet and shiny.

196
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:25,308
It's ready to invite a man!

197
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,428
Here we go!

198
00:15:58,182 --> 00:15:59,149
No!

199
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:00,916
Stop it!

200
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:04,813
Good!

201
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,421
No! No! Please stop!

202
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:14,723
No!

203
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,676
And now our next story...
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

204
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,474
Around 12:00 noon today,
a fire broke out at the...
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

205
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:32,108
M.M. Pharmaceuticals company
in Yonago City, Tottori Prefecture...

206
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:36,513
Yukimitsu Miura, the Chief of the 3rd
development division...

207
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:37,851
died in the fire.

208
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:40,550
The cause of the
fire is still unknown.

209
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:41,956
Arson has not been ruled out.

210
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:46,294
Oh, no.
A power failure?

211
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:15,022
Who can it be, this early?

212
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:16,521
Brother!

213
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:17,493
Chief!

214
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:20,524
This is no time to argue such things!

215
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:23,257
Detective, I need your help.

216
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:25,129
What happened?

217
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:25,999
A murder case.

218
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:26,901
What?

219
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,070
Don't look!

220
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:37,076
I have been giving him morning
wake-up calls every day at 7:30 AM.

221
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,750
But he didn't pick up
the phone this morning...

222
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:42,616
no matter how many times I called.

223
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:47,084
So I came here to wake him up.

224
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:52,262
Then, he was already dead...

225
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:01,795
This is the same as my dream.

226
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,107
What did you say?

227
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:07,342
Nothing, did you call the police?

228
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:13,442
The phone's been dead since
the power failure last night.

229
00:18:14,452 --> 00:18:17,785
The snowstorm may have knocked
the cellular phone transmitter down.

230
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:36,367
Why don't you have this?

231
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:38,339
Thank you.

232
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,677
I feel better now.

233
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:45,812
What should I do about the body?

234
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:50,018
To maintain the crime scene, let's
leave it as is for one more day.

235
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:57,452
If we can't contact the police by
tomorrow, we'll put him on the bed.

236
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:01,494
Is this related
to yesterday's murder?

237
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,293
By the looks of the
way he was killed...

238
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,398
Was the power failure caused by the
short circuit in the bath tub?

239
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:11,875
I think so.

240
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:13,837
What should we do now?

241
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:15,906
There's only one thing to do!

242
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:25,348
Nobody could've come in and out of
this resort from last night...

243
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:27,584
until the morning,
because of the snowstorm.

244
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:32,192
Therefore, the murderer is someone
still staying at the resort.

245
00:19:38,336 --> 00:19:39,030
Uh?

246
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:42,899
What's wrong, Asuka?

247
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:44,575
Oh, nothing.

248
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:49,973
Let's check all the people's
alibis in this resort right now.

249
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:58,384
What?

250
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:01,716
What do you want?

251
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:03,753
I'm not a stranger.

252
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:06,953
I was asked by the manager
of this resort...

253
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,899
to formally investigate
yesterday's murder case.

254
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,525
I don't know anything.

255
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:13,799
I told everything to
the police yesterday.

256
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:17,805
Are you trying to bother me?

257
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:19,910
There was another murder.

258
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,035
What?

259
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:26,306
11:30 PM was the time
the power failed.

260
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,645
Yes, excuse me but...

261
00:20:28,953 --> 00:20:30,716
I don't have an alibi.

262
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:33,553
I stayed in this room alone.

263
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:37,417
Alone at the resort
when murder took place?

264
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:39,687
I have no place else to go.

265
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,229
I'm about to go bankrupt.

266
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:43,096
I just got fired because of
company restructuring!

267
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:45,994
My wife and children left me!

268
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,205
The only real estate I have now,
is this condo at the resort.

269
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:51,536
I wanted to sell it earlier...

270
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:53,476
but it's very difficult
because of the recession!

271
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:57,173
Then the weird
murders happened!

272
00:20:57,281 --> 00:20:59,613
This will make the
value go down again!

273
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:00,808
Shit!

274
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:02,345
Stupid fool!

275
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,947
What can I do about it?!

276
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,282
Damn it!

277
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:16,791
Coming.

278
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:19,360
What can I do for you?

279
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,836
Is something wrong?

280
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:27,971
Did we meet each other
somewhere before?

281
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,779
Well, I don't remember...

282
00:21:32,516 --> 00:21:34,575
Is there something
I can do for you?

283
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:36,184
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well...

284
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,258
So, you're a private detective?
It sounds like an interesting job.

285
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:45,057
It's not interesting at all.

286
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:48,896
80% of my work is checking a
person's private life for a divorce.

287
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,993
It's a very plain and gloomy job.

288
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,162
How about you, Mr. Nezu?

289
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,104
I own an import-export company.

290
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:02,842
It's just a small company
with 10 employees.

291
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,081
Oh?

292
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:10,582
Please have some.

293
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,747
Thank you very much.

294
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,321
By the way, what were you doing
between 11:00 and 12:00 last night?

295
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,254
Oh, my alibi?

296
00:22:19,563 --> 00:22:20,359
Yes...

297
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:22,524
It's around the time
of the power failure.

298
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:25,600
I was watching TV.

299
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:28,933
When the power failed, I was
watching the news on TV...

300
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,669
about a fire at the M.M. Pharmaceuticals
manufacturing company.

301
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:45,155
I see.

302
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:47,356
Thank you very much.

303
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:52,187
Oh, I see you collect
antique books.

304
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,920
Oh, you noticed?

305
00:22:54,732 --> 00:23:00,068
I collected these books when I went
abroad on my business trips.

306
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:01,704
They must be very valuable.

307
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:03,138
They are.

308
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:04,832
For example...

309
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,910
This is a medical book
from ancient Egypt.

310
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:10,173
Ancient Egypt?

311
00:23:10,748 --> 00:23:15,048
This book describes the
way to obtain eternal life.

312
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,108
Which means?

313
00:23:16,754 --> 00:23:19,222
It's a technique
to create a mummy.

314
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:21,350
A mummy?

315
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:26,122
I see, so there is no such
thing as eternal life.

316
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:28,089
It's rather ominous...

317
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:31,094
Modern medical science
is much more ominous.

318
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:35,604
Medical science and chemistry were
both developed from medieval alchemy...

319
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:37,698
only in the past
few hundred years.

320
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:40,804
Modern medical science is a worthless
study with a shallow history.

321
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:42,676
Even using humans as guinea pigs.

322
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:46,248
It's no equal to the ancient
knowledge of magic...

323
00:23:46,283 --> 00:23:48,376
which has existed for
thousands of years.

324
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:53,119
Have you ever heard
of the Necronomicon?

325
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:54,587
No.

326
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:01,787
It's a banned book written by
Abdul Alhazard in 730 AD.

327
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:08,499
The book describes the method to
gain eternal life, like you just said.

328
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:10,933
Eternal life?

329
00:24:11,142 --> 00:24:13,610
To be more precise, it's a way to
bring the dead back to life.

330
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:16,374
It's quite different from
making a mummy.

331
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,317
Is something wrong?

332
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:30,587
No, I just felt dizzy.

333
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:32,488
Are you all right?

334
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,727
Yes, I guess I stayed here too long.

335
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:38,566
I'm sorry to disturb you.

336
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,467
Take care.

337
00:24:47,878 --> 00:24:49,175
Can I help you?

338
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:55,010
The manager said to me that two
people are staying in this room.

339
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:58,215
Yes, Nozomi is still sleeping.

340
00:24:58,589 --> 00:24:59,954
Is she your sister?

341
00:25:00,825 --> 00:25:02,884
No, I'm her private tutor.

342
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:08,389
Nozomi's parents and I
are very close.

343
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,997
Her parents went abroad
to do some research...

344
00:25:13,237 --> 00:25:16,365
so I'm taking care of Nozomi
while they are away.

345
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:18,305
I see.

346
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,536
What were you doing around
11:30 PM last night?

347
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,713
Well, I was here with her.

348
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:33,716
Oh, Nozomi, I'm sorry.
Did I wake you up?

349
00:25:35,893 --> 00:25:37,554
What's the matter, Nozomi?

350
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:38,390
What's wrong?

351
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:42,162
Nozomi?

352
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,726
Nozomi!

353
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,636
It must be motion aphasia.

354
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,639
Aphasia?

355
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:57,406
I can't explain it clearly
because I'm not a doctor...

356
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,548
but I've seen the
same symptoms before.

357
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,145
But why?

358
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:08,155
This symptom comes out
from a strong mental shock.

359
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,015
Mental shock?

360
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,958
Yes.

361
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:16,095
Did she see something unusual...

362
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,697
or experience anything
abnormal yesterday?

363
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:23,265
No...

364
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:24,773
Not at all.

365
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:31,377
Then I suggest you see a doctor
as soon as the snowstorm stops.

366
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:32,713
Yes.

367
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:35,347
Nozomi... don't worry.

368
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,480
This kind of symptom naturally
cures itself sometimes.

369
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,418
I'm sorry to bother you.

370
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:45,652
Take care!

371
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,126
I smell something between
them and Hiruta, but what?

372
00:27:03,347 --> 00:27:04,075
Mina?

373
00:27:05,983 --> 00:27:08,747
I finished my work
a day earlier.

374
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,760
My room number is 50H.

375
00:27:19,196 --> 00:27:21,187
Can you carry my luggage?

376
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,425
How did you get here
in this snowstorm?

377
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,606
I got a ride on the police snowcat
at the base of the mountain.

378
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,006
Police?

379
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:34,874
I heard that a murder
happened here.

380
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:37,004
They first refused.

381
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,979
They said I shouldn't come up,
because it's dangerous.

382
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:41,515
But since they were supposed
to inspect the crime scene again...

383
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:43,116
I see.

384
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:45,183
Mina...

385
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,385
I have a favor to ask you.

386
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:50,057
Anything...

387
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,452
But it might cost you a lot.

388
00:27:54,264 --> 00:27:56,858
The phones don't work
because of the snowstorm.

389
00:27:57,101 --> 00:28:02,801
But I want to get photographs of the
crime scene from the police computer.

390
00:28:03,374 --> 00:28:04,602
Can you do that?

391
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:09,473
I understand the situation, but
why do you say "can you do that?".

392
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:11,545
I guess you can't.

393
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:13,879
Don't be stupid!
That's not what I meant.

394
00:28:14,685 --> 00:28:16,516
I'm a professional
information collector.

395
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,815
So I'm telling you not
to patronize me.

396
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:21,913
What is it?

397
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:23,320
Iridium.

398
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:27,496
This is a special model,
but I think you've heard of it before.

399
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:32,566
The cellular phone you can transmit
from anywhere on the Earth.

400
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:36,535
Which do you think
performs better, yours or this?

401
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,250
It's ready!

402
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:51,744
The address of the
National Police Agency is...

403
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:02,660
Here, I'm in.

404
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,427
This is...

405
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:42,072
Stop.

406
00:29:43,874 --> 00:29:45,205
Can you zoom in?

407
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:46,299
Of course.

408
00:29:51,682 --> 00:29:52,808
I thought so.

409
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,646
What?

410
00:29:53,817 --> 00:29:54,647
What's wrong?

411
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:59,019
I can conclude that the murderer
of both the Sato family and Hiruta...

412
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:00,648
is the same person.

413
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:04,323
The conditions of the dead bodies
are completely the same.

414
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:07,154
No matter what the reason...

415
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:11,793
Normal people don't gouge
out human eyeballs.

416
00:30:12,836 --> 00:30:14,827
And the clue to
the criminal is...

417
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,036
This!

418
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,070
This ice pick broke off
when he gouged the eyeball...

419
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,100
because the nasal bone blocked it.

420
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:23,680
This is stabbed from the left.

421
00:30:25,015 --> 00:30:26,243
Which means?

422
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:30,114
The criminal must be left-handed.

423
00:30:44,268 --> 00:30:45,826
Did I help you?

424
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:50,135
Yes, it's still only a guess
but I found a likely suspect.

425
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,199
Mina...

426
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:55,307
Can you call the manager's
room five minutes from now...

427
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:57,336
and have the police come to 60D.

428
00:30:57,681 --> 00:30:58,613
All right.

429
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,248
You should pay my price
for this information, tonight.

430
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,418
Yeah.

431
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,925
I want to ask him something
before the police take him.

432
00:31:14,565 --> 00:31:18,126
I think I've met him
somewhere before.

433
00:31:32,082 --> 00:31:33,982
Mr. Nezu, are you here?

434
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,057
Mr. Nezu!

435
00:31:47,397 --> 00:31:48,728
It can't be!

436
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:11,947
The most likely person is now dead.

437
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:15,484
Who will be the next suspect?

438
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:37,036
What now, Suzusaki?!

439
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:39,138
Teasing the police department!

440
00:32:41,385 --> 00:32:42,181
What are you doing?!

441
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:43,345
What did you do?!

442
00:32:47,557 --> 00:32:48,888
You're under arrest for murder!

443
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,017
I didn't do it.

444
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,358
I...

445
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:53,290
I didn't do it!!
