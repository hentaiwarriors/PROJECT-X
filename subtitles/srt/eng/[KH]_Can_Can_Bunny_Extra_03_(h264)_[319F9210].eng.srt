1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,140
l'm Kenta Ochiai.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,090
l'm just a regular guy, an average student.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,360
But since l met Suwatee, Shuree and the Gods of Luck, my life has changed!

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,230
l've been getting as much action as l can handle!

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,830
Ah! Life is good!

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,170
Then this gorgeous nurse, Haruna Sakamoto, appeared.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,140
l want to share all the happiness of life with her...

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,780
Oh! l've never been this happy!

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,390
Can Can Bunny

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,890
Can Can Bunny
Extra 3

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,800
Seiryuka Hospital

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,960
Haruna's missing?

13
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,970
Yes, she didn't come home last night. Mr. Okamura is very worried.

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,810
l'll help look for her.

15
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,040
Hey, wait!

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,240
We were the last people to see her.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,880
She's probably out playing somewhere.
After all, she is a little girl.

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,180
What do you mean by that?

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,260
What's wrong, Shuree?

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,250
What's that?

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,590
l think it's...

22
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,800
This is the cross that Haruna wore.

23
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,670
Her grandfather Sakamoto and l were best friends.

24
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,270
He left this cross to her.

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,080
l feel strong spiritual energy coming from the cross.

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,980
ls it...

27
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,970
lt's the same presence l felt yesterday in the garden.

28
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,210
Does that cross have some kind of story behind it?

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,390
This cross belonged to my old lover, Kyoko Kawashima.

30
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,560
Fifty years ago, this was an army hospital.

31
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,300
Sakamoto and l worked here.

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,400
We had no hope for the future then.

33
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,140
We nursed people while waiting for our own deaths at the front.

34
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,440
Then she appeared in front of us... Kyoko Kawashima.

35
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,350
She was working in the same hospital as us.

36
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,010
l fell in love with her.

37
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,050
Kyoko and l made a promise that after the war, we would be married.

38
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,400
But while l was visiting my family,

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,760
Kyoko was killed.

40
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,000
Sakamoto took the cross from her neck.

41
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,330
lt was then l finally realized he also loved her.

42
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,040
The war finally ended.

43
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,110
Sakamoto found a woman who looked like Kyoko and married her.

44
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,510
Haruna strongly resembles Kyoko.

45
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,310
The only things that remain are the flower garden and fountain.

46
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,910
l see...

47
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,000
There's no mistake. lt's the same spiritual signature as the cross.

48
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,230
Then, Haruna was here?

49
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,410
Kyoko, forgive me! Kyoko!

50
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,860
The spiritual energy is getting stronger! Kenta, be careful!

51
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,880
l will, but where is she?

52
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,130
Haruna!

53
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,330
Kenta, wait!

54
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,100
What is it?

55
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,100
There's something dangerous here.

56
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,970
But, Haruna is...

57
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,530
<i>Help me! Uncle, help me!</i>

58
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,810
Kyoko, stop it! Haruna!

59
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,670
l must go! Haruna! Kyoko!

60
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,020
Haruna's in there. l'm going!

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,680
Wait!

62
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,380
Help me! Help me!

63
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,950
Haruna!

64
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,020
Kenta, behind you!

65
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,150
Kenta!

66
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,160
O spirits of the air around me!

67
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,090
Spirits that rule time and space, in the name of Kishoten, l command thee!

68
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,330
Combine your powers with mine!

69
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,470
Kenta, it's coming from where the old man is!

70
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,040
Kyoko, you can't! Kyoko!

71
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,860
Kenta, don't leave me!

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,190
Kyoko, forgive me! Kyoko!

73
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,190
Mr. Okamura!

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,660
Hold on! l'll call a nurse!

75
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,240
l'm fine. Take me to the garden!

76
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,270
Kyoko is the one who kidnapped Haruna.

77
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,980
lt's her anger.

78
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,170
Why?

79
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,950
When l went to visit my family, Kyoko was already pregnant with my child.

80
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,960
But l was forced into an arranged marriage by my parents.

81
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,750
What?

82
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,820
l didn't tell Kyoko what had happened.

83
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,220
When l didn't return, she forced Sakamoto to tell her the truth.

84
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,190
The night Kyoko was going to come after me, she was killed.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,170
She must have hated me...

86
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,070
No, she had every right to!

87
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,210
Since then l've dedicated my life to this hospital.

88
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,570
l beg you, Kenta! Please take me to the garden!

89
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,480
l will.

90
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,090
Kyoko, you're there, aren't you? lt's me! Do you understand?

91
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,860
Takeshi?

92
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,710
Kyoko, please let that child go!

93
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,140
Kyoko!

94
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,710
Takeshi, l've been so lonely and sad.

95
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,790
But l believed that you would come back, so l've been waiting all this time!

96
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,890
No, you're wrong!

97
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,950
Aren't you coming back to me?!

98
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,600
Stop! Haruna has nothing to do with this!

99
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,870
Mr. Okamura!

100
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,470
Kyoko, it's my fault.

101
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,400
l'm the one who betrayed you.

102
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,450
lt's too late to ask you to forgive me, but that child is innocent!

103
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,080
Kill me instead!

104
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,820
l won't let my child go!

105
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,750
You're wrong. That child is Sakamoto's.

106
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,790
Kenta, l'm taking us back to the past.

107
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,650
Fifty years ago, Kyoko died here full of hate.

108
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,560
We'll take the old man back and have him meet the living Kyoko.

109
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,430
C-Can you do that?

110
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,960
There's no other way if you want to save those two.

111
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,770
Spirits of present, past, future!

112
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,940
ln the name of the Kishoten, l command thee.

113
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,230
Spirits of the air around me!

114
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,350
Come to my hand and set free the substance of space!

115
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,580
Relive the past!

116
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,650
This... This is fifty years ago!

117
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,030
Haruna!

118
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,090
Haruna, hold on!

119
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,260
Kenta, l...

120
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,630
Kyoko! Kyoko!

121
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,910
Don't die, Kyoko! Hold on!

122
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Takeshi, is it you? My eyes! l can't see!

123
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,680
l'm here.

124
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,020
You didn't come back. Sakamoto said...

125
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,350
Kyoko...

126
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,650
The baby... l didn't know what to do.

127
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,330
l wanted to see you and...

128
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,620
lt's hard to breathe. Dearest!

129
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,670
Kyoko, l...

130
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,200
Don't leave me. Stay by my side always, please. The three of us...

131
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,810
Kyoko, wait! l still have things that l need to say!

132
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,480
Mr. Okamura!

133
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,060
Kenta.

134
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,860
Where are we?

135
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,490
lt's all right. lt's over now.

136
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,370
Mr. Okamura is safely back in his hospital room, too.

137
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,200
That mysterious woman is really powerful, isn't she?

138
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,400
No, no, no. That is...

139
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,800
lt's okay. l won't tell anyone.

140
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,180
Now l understand why Grandfather cherished that cross so much.

141
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,050
And why Uncle Okamura treasures me.

142
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,090
Kyoko was wonderful, wasn't she?

143
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,250
Beautiful and kind...

144
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,450
Haruna.

145
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,150
l was so scared! So very scared, Kenta!

146
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,720
lt's all right now.

147
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,230
Haruna?

148
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,870
l...

149
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,940
Oh no! What am l doing?

150
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,980
Haruna.

151
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,150
Please, Kenta.

152
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,290
What's wrong with me?

153
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,470
l've never felt these feelings before.

154
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,270
l really like you, Kenta!

155
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,300
Haruna!

156
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,020
<i>Why doesn't he just go for it?</i>

157
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,850
Kenta, l've never...

158
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,730
lf you don't want to, Haruna, l...

159
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,630
No, l want to be with you, Kenta.

160
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,360
Okay.

161
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,940
Kenta, l'm scared.

162
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,930
lt'll be all right. Leave it to me.

163
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,710
Haruna, you're wonderful.

164
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,580
Kenta!

165
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,690
No!

166
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,730
No one's ever...

167
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,030
Your first time?

168
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,870
Haruna, relax your thighs.

169
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,480
Kenta, hurry. l can't wait.

170
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,060
Just a little while longer.

171
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,520
Are you okay, Haruna?

172
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,590
Yes.

173
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,730
Kenta's being extra gentle.

174
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,630
Maybe he's really fallen in love.

175
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,910
Huh? What's this?

176
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,410
Haruna, you're very beautiful.

177
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,140
l'm embarrassed, Kenta.

178
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,980
You must think l'm disgusting.

179
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,910
That's not true.

180
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,290
Kenta! Kenta!

181
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,420
ls it okay, Haruna?

182
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,490
Why does my chest hurt? Kenta, l...

183
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,340
Haruna!

184
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,110
Did it hurt?

185
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,670
lt's okay. Go on.

186
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,180
<i>She's so delicate!</i>

187
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,150
l'm afraid l'll break her if l move!

188
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,810
Please stop, l...

189
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,080
Haruna, l can't hold back...

190
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,550
lt's okay, Kenta, go on.

191
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,590
Why can't l stop crying?

192
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,930
l'm sorry. Did l hurt you?

193
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,660
No, it's okay.

194
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,670
lf l made you happy, then l'm happy.

195
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:13,870
Haruna.

196
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,950
What a lousy day! lt's pouring down rain!

197
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,760
Hey, Kenta, have you seen Shuree?

198
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,460
lsn't she here?

199
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,000
l thought she was with you.

200
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,930
l haven't seen her since last night.

201
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,010
What's going on?

202
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,820
<i>Now that l think of it, you really are quite beautiful.</i>

203
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,530
<i>That stupid guy has me all confused.</i>

204
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,910
Suwatee, why do you love him?

205
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,480
l don't understand it myself.

206
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,740
You don't?

207
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,280
Why don't you confess your love to Kenta, tomorrow?

208
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,960
Hey, l'm home.

209
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,430
Huh?

210
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,340
Suwatee, are you alone?

211
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,570
Where's everyone else?

212
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,140
Kenta, what would you do if l weren't here anymore?

213
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,540
What would l do?

214
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,740
Would you be lonely?

215
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,180
What are you talking about?

216
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,290
Hey, do you have a crush on me or something?

217
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,310
What if l do?

218
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,290
lf l did, would that bother you?

219
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,230
You're crazy! You can't be serious!

220
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,630
Even if l liked you, we couldn't do anything anyway.

221
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,200
That's true.

222
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,860
Hey, wait!

223
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,370
Suwatee?

224
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,140
So did you tell Kenta how you feel?

225
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,850
And...?

226
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:45,290
Why? Do you plan to marry that old man without even touching the one you love?

227
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,730
Even if l touch him with the power of the star, the memory will be erased.

228
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,790
lf l could be with Kenta, love him...

229
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,870
l'd rather die with all those memories than live without them.

230
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,150
lf you don't do something, then l'll take him!

231
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,880
He's someone l wasn't supposed to love.

232
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,660
l didn't turn on the computer.

233
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,960
Hey, Kenta! You insensitive bastard!

234
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,870
W-What did you say? Hey!

235
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,430
We're going back to Heaven.

236
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,700
So this is goodbye!

237
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,640
Hope things go well with all the girls you laid! Later.

238
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,510
Hey, wait! Shuree!

239
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,610
Here Come the Gods

240
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,380
Take care of yourself! See you!

241
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,050
Don't get lonely when we don't see you anymore.

242
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,420
Not see me?

243
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,060
What about Suwatee?

244
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,430
Kenta, l'm sorry. This is goodbye.

245
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,220
Suwatee, where are you?

246
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,320
l really loved you, Kenta.

247
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,810
But there are others who love you.

248
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,040
So you'll be okay without me, right? So...

249
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,480
Suwatee, wait!

250
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,210
Suwatee...

251
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,700
Soon you'll marry the Emperor.

252
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,640
Are you okay, Suwatee?

253
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,570
Suwatee?

254
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,830
l don't want to!

255
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,540
Don't want to? But now it's...

256
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,080
Shuree, save me! Save me!

257
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,980
l don't want to leave Kenta after all!

258
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,510
lt's okay if l can't touch him!

259
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,120
l want to be by his side!

260
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,560
Well, aren't you a spoiled princess?

261
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,860
ls it really enough just to be by his side?

262
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,670
Yes...

263
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,470
Then give the piece of the star to me.

264
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,780
You weren't the one who stole the piece of star. l was.

265
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,020
l'll get married for you!

266
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,020
No! No way! No!

267
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,920
Suwatee...

268
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,560
Suwatee, it won't do you any good.

269
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,100
Give it to me.

270
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,530
No! No! No way!

271
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,060
l won't let you go!

272
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,080
Stop it! Stop it!

273
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,050
No! Be quiet now.

274
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,420
This way you can be by Kenta's side.

275
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,860
Now stop crying.

276
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,560
Suwatee, be good to Kenta, okay?

277
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,160
Goodbye!

278
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,460
Shuree...

279
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,770
Kishoten, huh? What do you want?

280
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,840
Emperor Shibi, look at this!

281
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,950
l am the one who stole the piece of star.

282
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,180
What was that?

283
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,310
So, l'm saying l'll be your wife!

284
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,350
Or don't you want me?

285
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,190
Very well.

286
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,800
Though your beauty has a different flavor from Suwatee's.

287
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,410
So, can l ask you one favor?

288
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,580
What is it?

289
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,010
lt would be hard to say no to a beauty like you.

290
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,830
What's happening to this room?

291
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,170
What's going on?

292
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,880
S-Shuree?

293
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,910
What is it? Did you forget something?

294
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,710
Yeah, l forgot to say something important.

295
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,850
What if l told you that l liked you, Kenta?

296
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,360
What?

297
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,100
Even if that were true, we couldn't...

298
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,960
That's true!

299
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,090
Sorry, Suwatee.

300
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,400
O spirit of the star, mirror my form!

301
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,010
Hide what can be seen, show what is hidden!

302
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,530
Your powers to me!

303
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,050
l can touch you!

304
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,000
As usual, your hands are faster than your brain.

305
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,560
What do you mean by that?

306
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,270
Kenta...

307
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,630
Shuree, what's happened to you?

308
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,740
ls this for real?

309
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,410
Sorry! l'm sorry.

310
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,280
l... l didn't know what else to do!

311
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,500
Hey, Kenta, don't you like me?

312
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,010
Well, l...

313
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,940
lt's okay. l understand.

314
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,550
l was so mean to you.

315
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,090
But when you said that l was pretty, it made me so happy.

316
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,450
l meant it. You really are pretty.

317
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,000
lt's okay even if you don't like me.

318
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,260
Just this once, make love to me.

319
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,540
Shuree, are you teasing me?

320
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,230
Believe me. l really love you, Kenta.

321
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,110
<i>Suwatee, it's your own fault, because you waited too long!</i>

322
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,410
Kenta, look at the real me.

323
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,820
l'm embarrassed after all, Kenta.

324
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,950
Shuree, l do like you.

325
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,820
l'm so happy!

326
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,770
Kenta, let me love you.

327
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,230
S-Shuree, that's...

328
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,910
Shuree, that's so good.

329
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,460
Kenta, l can't wait any more!

330
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,270
Kenta?

331
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,860
Shuree, you look so cute.

332
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,170
Be good to me, please.

333
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:19,880
Kenta...

334
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,720
Kenta, l love you!

335
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,880
Shuree...

336
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,850
<i>After this. After this, l can forget him.</i>

337
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,640
Yes! More! Kenta!

338
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,140
lt feels so good.

339
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,290
Kenta, that's...

340
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,830
Kenta! More! Don't stop!

341
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,630
Shuree...

342
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,520
Kenta, l'm coming. You, come too.

343
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,980
Let's come together!

344
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,360
Shuree, you were wonderful.

345
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,550
Kenta...

346
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,800
Shuree, are you crying?

347
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,490
Kenta, this is for you.

348
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,400
But you always wear this.

349
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,570
Yes. Don't forget about me, okay?

350
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,670
Please, don't forget me. Don't forget me.

351
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,140
Shuree! Hey!

352
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,480
ls that all you're going to say?

353
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,230
Pearl: ''No! After this, please no more!''
Makoto: ''Hehehe! Don't move around so much!''

354
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,800
Pearl: ''l love you! l'm never letting you go!''
Makoto: ''Wait a minute!''

355
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,440
l guess there's such a thing as too much love.

356
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,870
lt can't be!

357
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,710
lt's been a while, Kenta.

358
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,350
S-Suwatee!

359
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,650
Ahh, this time you do remember me!

360
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,990
Suwatee, why are you hanging out with this loser?

361
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,260
Shuree, you came back too?

362
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,190
Hey, Shuree, what do you mean by loser?

363
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,390
You're sure friendly. Who are you?

364
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,360
Hey, this is mine!

365
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,140
Why is it here?

366
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,310
You gave it to me.

367
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,170
What are you talking about?!

368
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,780
Don't you remember that time?

369
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,140
So when was ''that time?''

370
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,510
That time when you came here.

371
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,280
Me? Why would l come here?

372
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,240
ldiot! l can't talk about it!

373
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,210
Well, say it, you creep!

374
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,620
Did you really forget?

375
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,480
Shuree!

376
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,990
Don't tell me you used the
star's power with Kenta?

377
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,460
What are you talking about?

378
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,930
Unfair! You did!

379
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,660
l don't know what you're talking about.

380
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,330
Kenta, you ignored me, but you did it with Shuree!

381
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,870
Kenta, you idiot!

382
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,140
Now Suwatee is getting upset.

383
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,370
Looks like she's headed for a love triangle with Shuree!
