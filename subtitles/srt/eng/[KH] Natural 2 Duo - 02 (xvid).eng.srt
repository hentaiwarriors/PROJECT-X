1
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,980
Since I was very young, I had been a cry-baby.

2
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,180
I had always followed someone's back.

3
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,700
Suddenly, I lost that back to follow.

4
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,830
Onii-chan

5
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,370
Wait just a minute...!

6
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,170
Wait for what?

7
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,550
Um nothing. Please, go ahead?

8
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,090
"Go ahead"? You.

9
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,160
No!

10
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,940
It's so strange. Is this what they mean by "feeling it"?

11
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,860
You can't! A place like that.

12
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,680
If this is no good, then where would be good?

13
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,860
But...

14
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,870
l didn't know it would feel like this.

15
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,210
l can't believe it.

16
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,380
Onii-chan's finger is moving around.

17
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,450
What's happening to me?

18
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,420
lf you do it so hard!

19
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,760
You're wet. It's pretty good, for your first time.

20
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,340
Don't say things like that.

21
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,690
He can tell, things like that.

22
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,420
It's embarrassing

23
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,500
Onii-chan

24
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,580
You're putting it in?

25
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,090
It hurts!

26
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,430
Onii-chan! It hurts!

27
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,130
He's entering me. Onii-chan is inside me!

28
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,940
Onii-chan. Onii-chan. Please I...!

29
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,190
Onii-chan!

30
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,650
Onii-chan. Onii-chan. Onii-chan!

31
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,030
Is it finished?

32
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,540
Was it painful?

33
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,950
Not as much as l thought.

34
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,850
Something is still inside me.

35
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,650
Um nothing...

36
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,520
Someday, l knew this would happen.

37
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,160
From that time when I saw him again so suddenly.

38
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,300
Was Brother any different?

39
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,780
Yeah

40
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,660
I understand

41
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,230
Yeah

42
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,490
l'll come home early today.

43
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,560
See you.

44
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,110
So he's back.

45
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,890
You're the one who asked me to play, so why are you behind me?

46
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,410
Because, l can see your back.

47
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,270
What?

48
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,100
That because

49
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,690
Onii-chan

50
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,100
So I can see your back.

51
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,970
Brother?

52
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,840
That hurt!

53
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,080
You hit me with your fist!

54
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,360
You hit a delicate Iady with your fist!

55
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:14,180
Senpai! Look at the bump on my head! Here, right here! Senpai!

56
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,450
Kuu?

57
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,600
What the?

58
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,400
Ten years, you never even wrote.

59
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,690
Then you suddenly appear?

60
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,450
Tonight was supposed to be a heart felt reunion, and it's ruined!

61
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,330
''Suddenly appear", like a bug?

62
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,230
lts your fault for working where l had an interview.

63
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,400
How can you say that to a poor working student?

64
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,360
What is it?

65
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,060
Kuu, you've changed a lot.

66
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,250
You use to be quiet and cried alI the time.

67
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,780
Well of course.

68
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,330
Anybody would after being Ieft behind for ten years.

69
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,740
Okay, okay.

70
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,730
But the truth is.

71
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,260
The truth is l haven't changed at all, Onii-chan.

72
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,540
Geez, She's out after having her fun.

73
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,090
She was happy to see you.

74
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,950
We waited such a Iong time for you to come home.

75
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,240
Kuu and you as weIl

76
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,300
Made me realize that ten years is a long time.

77
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,220
Neither of you seem like the two I left behind.

78
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,960
Nii-sama. Which do you like better, the new or old me?

79
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,360
It's not what l like or not.

80
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,330
But I always want to be the Chisato that you love.

81
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,510
Kuu will catch cold.

82
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,710
Oh, you're right.

83
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,210
What, it's wet, oh no, why?

84
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,160
Hey Kuu! Are you still sleeping?

85
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,260
Don't come in without warning!

86
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,320
What? Are you sleeping in the nude?

87
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,630
Don't say stupid stuff like that!

88
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,390
Hurry up and come down. You'll be late.

89
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,890
Brother!

90
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,580
About that...

91
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,580
I'll go warm up the engine.

92
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,700
Aren't you lucky, Kuu?

93
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,440
Yeah

94
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,330
Kuu?

95
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,780
What's wrong with her?

96
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,310
l'm surprised that you're a student here.

97
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,230
What's wrong with it?

98
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,160
You used to like art better.

99
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,510
Oh? Did I?

100
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,640
Yes, you did. The only music you listened to was my violin.

101
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,670
I found that my talent was in music instead of art.

102
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,810
You said it, not me.

103
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,760
What is it?

104
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,030
Teacher

105
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,610
Kanoko?

106
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,510
Aren't you Kanoko?

107
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,230
It's been three years! How are you?

108
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,440
Yeah

109
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,420
How is the professor?  Tell him I said hello.

110
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,610
Okay, l'll tell him.

111
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,920
She is Professor Akiyamas only daughter. l used to be her tutor.

112
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,210
She's a good girl, but shes got a phobia about foreigners.

113
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,970
She's afraid huh. I see.

114
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,520
It's my day off, but I spend it shoveling snow.

115
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,670
We did it all ourselves while you were gone, so no complaining.

116
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,100
When it's a Iittle warmer, I'll go with you on a drive as a thank you.

117
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,630
That's just you wanting to go for a drive.

118
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,890
You could say so. But it's okay, right?

119
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,800
To me a day off is just that, I'm off.

120
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,860
A drive? No way.

121
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,360
Geez! Tightwad!

122
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,980
Hey!

123
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,410
This goes in the trash!

124
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,070
What a waste!

125
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,400
You smoke too much!

126
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,620
I haven't seen you for awhiIe.

127
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,430
About five years?

128
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,280
I heard your were working in Sakaguchi's editing department.

129
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,600
And you also got two lovely relatives.

130
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,140
What do you want to say?

131
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,610
We're alone, so you might as well tell the truth.

132
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,300
Do you Iike your new toys?

133
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,080
Shut the hell up.

134
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,950
It hasn't changed. This is the same too.

135
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,220
I was asked just to drive you home. I'm leaving.

136
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,810
It's just like you to pretend not to understand.

137
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,710
Stop it. l've changed from how l was.

138
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,910
Are you serious?

139
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,650
You are the same as before.

140
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,670
The real character of a person can't change.

141
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,790
You can't love another person.

142
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,020
Shut up!

143
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,950
Because you can't trust anyone.

144
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,450
Shut up! You whore!

145
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,610
Whore? How can you say that.

146
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,550
You calIed me just because you wanted me to rape you! You nymphomaniac!

147
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,860
That's right. See, this much.

148
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,130
Since l saw your face.

149
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,780
Wait! Not so rough!

150
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,830
Don't think you can controI me, Ayane!

151
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,820
No! Wait! Please!

152
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,270
You might act stuckup, but this part of you is as loose as ever.

153
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,030
Don't say things like that.

154
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,750
I'll rape you.

155
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,040
Ayane. This is what you want, right!

156
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,250
Wait!

157
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,350
AIl you're good for is a hole!

158
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,360
How can you!

159
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,010
No

160
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,590
I don't want to. Please no more!

161
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,460
No!

162
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,180
Damn it! Damn it!

163
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,430
That's right. People don't change, Shouma.

164
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,310
Onii-chan!

165
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,340
Chi-chan?

166
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,520
Onii-chan?!

167
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,740
ls this all?

168
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,300
Yeah. It's not much, is it?

169
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,480
Oh my are you moving?

170
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,230
Yeah. Kuu suddenly decided she wanted to live alone.

171
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,190
Geez, when she has such a nice place to Iive in.

172
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,140
It'll be lonely without you.

173
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,480
l've been thinking about it for awhiIe.

174
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,860
Since brother came back, it's a good oportunity.

175
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,900
Kuu

176
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,790
You can come back anytime. This is your home.

177
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,750
Yeah, l know. I'm sorry for being selfish, Chi-chan.

178
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,510
Let's get going.

179
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,630
Yeah.

180
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,560
Kuu...!

181
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,390
l'm sure she'll be back.

182
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,820
Yeah. She can't cook anything except stirfried noodIes.

183
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,110
Even though its a furnished apartment, you'll stilI need to buy a lot of things.

184
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,290
You want to go tomorrow?

185
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,590
Sure. Here's an ashtray.

186
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,580
Bought it the other day, very considerate of me huh?

187
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,170
I thought you would tell me to stop smokeing.

188
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,040
Because

189
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,000
I thought you wouIdn't come visit me.

190
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,050
Kuu

191
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,080
Onii-chan!

192
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,530
Onii-chan!

193
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,020
Onii-chan

194
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,850
I did something bad, didn't l?

195
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,500
Chi-chan really needs you.

196
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,670
That's why when I think

197
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,510
Kuu

198
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,350
When I think that because of me, Chi-chan might suffer.

199
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,420
When I think that l...

200
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,440
lts all right if Onii-chan loves Chi-chan.

201
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,090
Because l will love that Onii-chan.

202
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,500
lt should be around here.

203
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,190
Huh? You're Kanoko-chan, right?

204
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,380
Yes

205
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,600
I just got here myself. l wonder where those two went?

206
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,720
Sorry

207
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,950
It's ok.

208
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,920
Why don't you try studying abroad.

209
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,000
Studying in a different environment might be good for you.

210
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,120
Study abroad...

211
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,120
Hey! Lets go to the sea.

212
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,190
Let's go with Brother for a drive.

213
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,340
With teacher

214
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,830
Kinda earIy in the year to come to the sea.

215
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,140
But, I can't believe he agreed to it.

216
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,520
I used Kanoko-chan as bait, and got him in one try!

217
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,650
Bait?

218
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,320
How is Professor Akiyama?

219
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,280
Daddy is aIways nice, but it's just all fake.

220
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,350
Fake?

221
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,460
Yeah

222
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,190
Since l've been back, l havn't gone to see him.

223
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,190
Please tell him l'll come by soon.

224
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,760
Okay

225
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,320
Brother!

226
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,770
Kuu! What are you doing?

227
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,430
A student going to school is normal.

228
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,280
l guess you're right.

229
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,760
How about you?

230
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,800
l went to say hello to Professor Akiyama. l hadn't seen him for awhile.

231
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,840
Did something happen?

232
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,730
l was asked to tutor Kanoko.

233
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,490
Hey, wait!

234
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,700
Since we met, can't you say something Iike "I'll treat you to dinner"?

235
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,020
Sorry for not noticing. Well let's go to the noodIe stand by the station.

236
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,180
Whaaa!

237
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,200
l like that face.

238
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,300
Thank you very much.

239
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,870
lt ended up costing me again.

240
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,120
Thanks for dinner!

241
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,740
Now...

242
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,790
Going home?

243
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,910
Well...

244
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,820
Really? Here?

245
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,740
You don't want to?

246
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,680
At a place like this? lt's a Iittle perverted.

247
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,880
If not, lets go home.

248
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,230
I didn't say I won't, but...

249
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,620
They can't see us from above.

250
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,240
l wonder if they really can't see us.

251
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,370
Wait

252
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,270
Do you want to stop?

253
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,090
N-no. That's not it.

254
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,100
l don't have a change of clothes.

255
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,000
ln a place like this. Even though someone might come. l'm feeling good.

256
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:51,110
l'm really wet. Maybe l'm a little perverted too.

257
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,380
Even more than before, l'm really, really feeling it.

258
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,210
l want Onii-chan to move more and more.

259
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,620
Onii-chan, please. l don't want to finish Iike this.

260
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,310
What's the matter?

261
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,850
l can't see your face. I don't like that.

262
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,450
Oh

263
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,020
Like this?

264
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,680
Thats right.

265
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,670
l have to put it in myself.

266
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,490
lt's entering me. This is really.

267
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,510
What do l do now?

268
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,500
Do as you like.

269
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,740
But I don't know what to do.

270
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,230
Like this?

271
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,390
Yeah. But a Iittle faster.

272
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,090
l'm moving all by myself.

273
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,210
No, you can't do that.

274
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,540
It's all right if I don't do it too hard.

275
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,590
It's increadible! lt's in so deep!

276
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,160
No. Don't...

277
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,370
Onii-chan! l m scared! I'm scared!

278
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,320
I... l...

279
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,750
l don't like this.

280
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,870
You'lI just have to bear it.

281
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,590
What is this? Deep inside me. Something is coming, it's coming! l'm cumming!

282
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,940
l'm so happy Onii-chan!

283
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,690
It's mine.

284
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,220
Hello?

285
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,290
Is this Shouma-san? Chisato-san is, Chisato-san is...!

286
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,780
Chi-chan

287
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,120
She suddenly fainted in the garden.

288
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,730
According to the doctor it was an unexpected attack.

289
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,220
Thank you for everything.

290
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,500
Depending on the test resuIts, she should be able to go home.

291
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,500
So please don't worry too much.

292
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,770
Thank you.

293
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,420
It's no problem...

294
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,110
It's the same as that time.

295
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:47,130
That time when l didn't like Chi-chan taking all of Onii-chan's attention.

296
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,080
So l wished Chi-chan wouId go away.

297
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,580
Then there was a sound of breaking glass...

298
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,320
lt's all my fault!

299
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,940
Because l did something bad. Chi-chan is...!

300
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,480
l guess it still hasn't changed.

301
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,270
What?

302
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,670
That Chisato.

303
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,980
She didn't want to make us worry, so she pushed herseIf.

304
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,780
Her being stubborn and unyeilding is stilI the same.

305
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,540
And so is your being a cry-baby. It's just the same.

306
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,980
Onii-chan!

307
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,360
Onii-chan! What am I supposed to do?!

308
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,200
Onii-chan!
