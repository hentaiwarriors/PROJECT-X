1
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,324
As I thought.

2
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:29,532
Septem Charm Magical Kanan Vol. 3

3
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,271
Clash! Carmine vs. Cerulean Blue

4
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:37,181
Come on, Chihaya!

5
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:40,775
No!

6
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:43,984
Carmine's source of power is love.

7
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:47,925
We need to deepen our relationship. Right?

8
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:50,794
No.

9
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:54,100
You may by talking big,
but what's that over there?

10
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:56,425
What is that?

11
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,936
This is the sad nature of men.
We have no control.

12
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:10,182
All that's left is to take by force!

13
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,570
The crimson flame of love and passion!

14
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:40,375
Magical Angel Carmine!

15
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,639
What the hell were you doing?
Why did you transform me?

16
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:49,579
I do like Chihaya's
underdeveloped breasts.

17
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:54,422
But having those voluptuous breasts
of Carmine squeezing me is also good.

18
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:57,929
Natsuki! Reporting to duty!

19
00:01:58,198 --> 00:02:02,862
Who's breasts are underdeveloped,
you bastard?

20
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:06,929
This has its own sense of ecstasy.

21
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:10,200
Still saying that now?

22
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:12,873
That's too hard!

23
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:18,174
Sipping?

24
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:23,345
Don't mind me and continue on.

25
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:26,248
Queen Tsuyuha!

26
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:30,929
The queen of Ever Green!

27
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:38,602
I have felt a quiver of darkness in this city.

28
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,702
How could that be?

29
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:42,531
The work of Seed humans?

30
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:45,711
No, we can't be sure of that.

31
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:49,806
But there is no doubt
that there is something going on in Meihou.

32
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:02,387
So that was Chihaya Hiiragi?

33
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:05,426
Man, that scared me.

34
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:08,565
The queen of Ever Green
came to see me.

35
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:10,927
But now she's gone.

36
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:14,736
Come now!
It's time for our moment of love.

37
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:17,333
Natsuki! Reporting to duty!

38
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:25,407
I said "no" didn't I?

39
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:33,649
Natsuki, you idiot!

40
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:45,804
Time to clean up.

41
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:50,566
My, my. Stop being so mischievous.

42
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:55,480
Mama!

43
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:59,307
This is quite a nostalgic thing we have here.

44
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,686
Why is Emi's picture here?

45
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:07,486
How long has it been?

46
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:12,195
This is a picture
when I was still a student.

47
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:14,456
Mama's student days?

48
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:16,499
But this face...

49
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,883
Faster, faster.

50
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:37,822
That's it, more!
Give me more of your energy!

51
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:42,259
It's so hot! Let me drink some that.

52
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:53,401
Do it, baby. You are so good.

53
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,503
I like it.

54
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,806
Thank you.

55
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:38,440
Thanks to you, I've regained
most of my power.

56
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:51,195
Septem, the battle has already
moved to the next level.

57
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:54,293
But our preparations are not complete.

58
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:56,767
Leave it to me, Master Bergamot.

59
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,800
I have already prepared our next move.

60
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:21,751
I want to go in first.

61
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:27,589
I love wearing my suit,
it makes me feel so pretty.

62
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:37,700
Hazuna! This is part of my investigation!

63
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:40,279
Natsuki, I'm going back
to Ever Green for awhile.

64
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:43,672
But why?

65
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,682
We don't have enough information.

66
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,116
You must've seen it too,
when you came to this town.

67
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:57,062
The person who stole
the Seeds from Ever Green...

68
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,360
...may not have come to Meihou by chance.

69
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:10,737
No way, but if we didn't come
to this town...

70
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:13,802
I would've never met Chihaya.

71
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:26,914
So blue.

72
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,757
It was a beautiful blue sky like this,
the day I met Sayaka.

73
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:37,159
It's no good.
The magic circle is pulling me in!

74
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:48,378
It is Cerulean blue tea.

75
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,682
- Juvanitch.
- Yes?

76
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,383
Can you leave me alone?

77
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:54,209
But, Mistress...

78
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,458
Leave me alone!

79
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,457
Are you sure, Mistress Sayaka?

80
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:11,196
I have looked at the sky since that day.

81
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:18,774
The blueness of the sky
is too bright for me.

82
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:36,928
That day, I was investigating city of Meihou,
but I lost to the power of the magic circle.

83
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,596
And I got Sayaka mixed up in this.

84
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,730
There was only one way to save Sayaka.

85
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:04,246
The profound warrior of azure
Cerulean Blue has arrived!

86
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,888
But there is something I mustn't forget.

87
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,364
Cerulean Blue's magic circle.

88
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:16,793
It's proof that she's still incomplete
as a magical warrior.

89
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:26,677
Welcome! Come on in!

90
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:38,784
But this is incredible, Sayaka.

91
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:41,417
Riding in such a fancy car
like this every day!

92
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:44,222
Not just her car,
but her house is incredible, too.

93
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:48,233
It's as big as a castle
and the has a bunch of butlers and maids.

94
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:49,233
Maids?

95
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:52,635
Man, I want to go there.

96
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:54,763
And for what reason?

97
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:59,772
Chihaya, Natsuki, you're both so funny.

98
00:10:01,314 --> 00:10:03,782
It's your fault we were laughed at.

99
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,747
Why is it my fault?

100
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:17,262
We're already here.

101
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,797
Man, that was so fast.

102
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,866
Thank you Juvantich!

103
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:22,600
You're welcome.

104
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:24,998
Sayaka, I'll see you later.

105
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:26,831
It was very entertaining.

106
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,904
I will see you tomorrow. Goodbye.

107
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,507
Goodbye! I'll see you, later!

108
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:45,123
Man, I want maids.

109
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:48,293
Still saying that?
Shouldn't I be good enough for you?

110
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,591
If you'll say that,
at least let me screw you!

111
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,290
Maybe I don't want to
because you put it like that!

112
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:54,924
What? Tonight's okay?

113
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:56,023
Stupid!

114
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:00,228
I'm sorry, Chihaya!

115
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:03,566
Hey, that's...

116
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,641
It's a joke.

117
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:10,576
It's Emi.

118
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:18,350
Magical Kanan!

119
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,754
Why was Emi there?

120
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,386
I don't know.
She might be planning something?

121
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,596
A general hospital?

122
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:34,805
Let's go, Chihaya!

123
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,528
The nurse is...

124
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:04,568
Chihaya! Transform!

125
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:05,965
Okay!

126
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,355
Stop right there! Let go of that nurse!

127
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:50,471
Septem!

128
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:53,418
You feel for my trap.

129
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:54,881
Go get her!

130
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:07,459
Stop it!

131
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:10,734
What!

132
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:16,935
Cerulean Blue Eco-Shower!

133
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,518
I'll remember this!

134
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:43,768
Thank you Cerulean Blue!

135
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:47,403
Really, I whish you wouldn't trouble me
with the likes of these enemies.

136
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:49,498
You very silly girl.

137
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:54,269
Master Hazuna is busy right know.

138
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:01,045
Farewell, then. Take care of yourself.

139
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:08,493
Sayaka sure does change
personalities when she transforms.

140
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,859
It can't be helped.
When you transform...

141
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,558
you become the embodiment
of your desires.

142
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,335
But I don't have any desires.

143
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,504
What are you talking about?

144
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:22,507
When you transform,
your breasts are bigger!

145
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:25,567
You always worried about how
your breasts were underdeveloped.

146
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:43,585
I have returned, Master Hazuna.

147
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:47,257
The results? Do you have them?

148
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,568
Here. As you can see...

149
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:56,071
I wish that she would be able to
handle something as easy as this.

150
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:58,470
Don't say that. She's trying.

151
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:00,608
Cerulean Blue. What's wrong?

152
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:07,918
Come on, get her! Get her! Bitch!

153
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:13,455
After you're done, I want her. Hurry up.

154
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:17,121
Blame it on your dad!

155
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,522
We were put out of business
because of your dad!

156
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:24,325
Stop taking so long, I want some.

157
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:26,765
Come, here, to me.

158
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:31,337
Cerulean Blue! Blue!

159
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:35,572
No!

160
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:45,145
Chihaya!

161
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:48,593
How dare you peek into a girl's shower,
you scumbag!

162
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,652
No, it's a Seed undulation!

163
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:57,602
This is Sayaka's house.

164
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,605
I feel a strong Seed undulation here.

165
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:01,605
No way, it can't be.

166
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:03,665
Anyways, let's go, Chihaya.

167
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:12,617
What's going on?

168
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:14,619
Everyone's dominated
by the power of the Seed!

169
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:15,676
Sayaka!

170
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:17,621
Sayaka!

171
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:20,488
Thank goodness you're safe!

172
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:24,686
Sayaka!

173
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:28,364
Hazuna!

174
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,694
Watch out!

175
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,803
Cerulean Blue has been dominated
by the Seed!

176
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:39,206
Sayaka had darkness within her heart.

177
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:41,807
The seed got her there.

178
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:44,005
It was my fault.

179
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:46,744
I didn't notice that darkness.

180
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,720
Natsuki, let's transform!

181
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:51,652
We'll save Say...
I mean Cerulean Blue!

182
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:53,715
I got you! Chihaya!

183
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,381
The flame of love, friendship, and hope!

184
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:27,749
Magical Angel Carmine!

185
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,757
That day I was raped.

186
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,763
By some men of a subcontracted
company that my father abandoned.

187
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:54,014
From that day on,
I was unable to look up at the sky.

188
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:56,177
Despite that.

189
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:04,387
You were always so happy.

190
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:08,724
I'll show you the all pain
and sadness that I have felt.

191
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:09,961
Sayaka...

192
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:12,099
I will rape you.

193
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,639
- What's that?
- The Seed!

194
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,976
It responded to Cerulean Blue's desire!

195
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,841
You're getting wet.

196
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,721
You shouldn't have all the fun.

197
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:22,864
Now it's my turn to have fun.

198
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:57,842
It's not over yet.

199
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,845
My pain is far greater than this.

200
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:01,845
Carmine!

201
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:02,903
Stay back!

202
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,851
I didn't even realize it.

203
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:10,617
That you, Sayaka, were suffering so much.

204
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,479
That's why.

205
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:15,826
I'll take in all of your feelings.

206
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,221
That's all pretty talk.

207
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:23,558
There's no way,
that you understand my feelings!

208
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,136
How's that?
Feels good, doesn't it?

209
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,827
That's right, Carmine!
Feel it even more!

210
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:53,454
And expose everything!

211
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:56,491
Expose your all!

212
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:00,632
Expose yourself, Carmine!

213
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:05,443
Raise your voice higher!
Higher, higher!

214
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:08,210
That's it! Does it feel good?

215
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:10,348
I'll make you come, Carmine!

216
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:12,746
Now climax, Carmine!

217
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:17,952
It's okay, Sayaka.

218
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:21,253
I'll take in all of your feelings.

219
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,333
Chihaya.

220
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,005
Sayaka.

221
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:48,009
Chihaya.

222
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:55,717
All right!

223
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:58,019
She purified Sayaka's heart!

224
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:02,694
Hot! It's so hot!

225
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:04,969
It's hot. It's hot.

226
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:06,231
Sayaka!

227
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:12,708
Chihaya! It's a rebound!

228
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:13,836
A rebound?

229
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:16,776
Sayaka has absorbed
too much magic power.

230
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,213
At this rate, she'll be crushed by the magic!

231
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:20,985
What can we do?

232
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:22,987
There is only one way.

233
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:25,990
You have to absorb the magic!

234
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:28,960
You know the process.

235
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:32,455
Have sex with her!

236
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:34,790
You're the only one who can do it!

237
00:22:36,068 --> 00:22:37,000
Hazuna!

238
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:41,005
It's hot, it's hot, so hot.

239
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:43,007
Save me.

240
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:47,068
Save me!

241
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:51,338
All right.

242
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:03,147
So, what'd you find out?

243
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:05,012
It seems that the person
who stole the Seeds...

244
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,142
is a scientist that was dispatched
to this city 10 years ago.

245
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:12,685
So like us, he has to...

246
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:14,049
Yeah.

247
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,723
It seems he also fought alongside
a magical warrior.

248
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:20,430
Why did such a person steal the Seeds?

249
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:24,198
I couldn't find that out. But...

250
00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:26,135
But?

251
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:28,364
There definitely is something to this case.

252
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:38,673
I'm sorry, but we're closed for today.

253
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:42,743
Welcome home.

254
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:05,266
To Be Continued
