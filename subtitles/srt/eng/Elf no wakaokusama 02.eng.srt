1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:09,531
The Elven Bride 2

2
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:55,822
Honey!

3
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,551
Ho... ne... y!

4
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,855
It's morning, wake up, Honey!

5
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:06,295
You'll be late for work,
if you don't hurry up.

6
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:10,995
What?

7
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,569
You'll wake up if I kiss you?

8
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,112
Alright, alright!
Boy are you spoiled!

9
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,860
Hey, Kenji, no fooling around!

10
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,418
Milfa...

11
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,997
He's totally gone.

12
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,464
Honey!

13
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,456
Major morning breath!

14
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,804
I guess you're up now.

15
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,506
Come on, time to get going.

16
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,409
Wash your face, and then you can
have your breakfast.

17
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,671
Okay!

18
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,959
Milfa!

19
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,728
I did tell you that I was going to
take you to the clinic, right?

20
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,397
I should be home by noon.

21
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,667
That's fine, I guess,

22
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,804
but is it alright for a National Guard
Captain to take the afternoon off?

23
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,706
It'll be fine.

24
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,936
I know I can count on my staff.

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,240
Here's your lunch. Be careful!

26
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,250
Love you!

27
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,090
Bye-bye!

28
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,398
Open up! Open up! Open up!

29
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,310
I'm home, Milfa!

30
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,256
What's this disturbance?

31
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,416
Grandma!

32
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,258
Why are you...

33
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,131
Kenji...

34
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,671
I've told you not to call me Grandma
when I'm in this form!

35
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,273
How many times do I
have to tell you?!

36
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,576
Okay! Okay! Mitsuko! Mitsuko!

37
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,843
Good!

38
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:34,047
Well, I was in the neighborhood,
so I thought I'd swing by.

39
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,850
I just wanted to see how
you two were doing.

40
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,010
This sucks...

41
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,358
By the way, Kenji, what about your
job with the National Guard?

42
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,660
Even though you're very much
in love with your young wife,

43
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,862
you can't just blow off your job
playing around here.

44
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,398
You'd be neglecting your d uty
as man of the house.

45
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:57,303
I got off early to take
Milfa to the clinic.

46
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,406
She's going in for a check-up.

47
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,208
Didn't you hear from Milfa?

48
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,509
Yes, I did,

49
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,613
but I sent someone to tell you
that since I'm here,

50
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,215
you didn't need to come home early.

51
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,717
Didn't you get my message?

52
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,718
From who?

53
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,419
That's weird.

54
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,583
The guy said he was a new member
in your squad.

55
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,959
Captain...

56
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,160
You...

57
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,463
You're Gaku, the replacement!

58
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,932
Your grandmother is...

59
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,799
Oh, you're still here?

60
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,037
GAKU!

61
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,905
Hey, this isn't the time for stupid puns!

62
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,707
Pull yourself together, Gaku!

63
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,369
Did you eat him, Grandma?

64
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,713
What did you say, idiot?!

65
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,915
Oh! Mitsuko! Mitsuko!

66
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,251
It's not right to say I ate him.

67
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,353
I just took some of his spirit.

68
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:51,858
In order to stay in this form,
I need a lot of spirit.

69
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,926
You ghost! Bitch!

70
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,794
You know, he didn't want me
at first, but...

71
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,071
You can't run away from me.

72
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:21,543
You don't need to be afraid.
I just want a little bit of your spirit.

73
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,957
I'm gonna be raped!

74
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,791
Are you surprised?

75
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,127
This is what we call the secret magic,
the Rejuvenation.

76
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,296
So beautiful!

77
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,697
Excuse me, but...

78
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,666
It's Mitsuko, Mi... tsu... ko.

79
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,896
What's wrong? Is that it?

80
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,239
Mitsuko!

81
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,207
Don't lose your head!

82
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,466
You do have one really good thing...

83
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,215
...a very good sex organ.

84
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,368
Mitsuko! May I do it one more time?!

85
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,072
Mitsuko! Mitsuko!

86
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,040
You're so good...

87
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,580
Mitsuko, let me do it one more time!

88
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:02,751
Mitsuko! One more time, please!

89
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:20,634
Why don't we take a break now?

90
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,011
Mitsuko! One more time! Please!

91
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,979
I asked you to wait!

92
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,443
Mitsuko...

93
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,181
...one more time...

94
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,022
...please...

95
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm the one who was held,
and not let go.

96
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,906
We did it one hundred eight times.

97
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,610
Naturally, I got tired. So I was resting
when you came in.

98
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,513
Well, then, where's Milfa?

99
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,114
Milfa?

100
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,274
Well...

101
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,454
I forgot why I'm here.

102
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,718
Don't get senile, Grandma!

103
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,765
Oh! That shock helped me remember!

104
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,168
I'm the one who got shocked.

105
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,671
I came back because we forgot
the insurance card.

106
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,074
Milfa's already on her way
to the clinic.

107
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,475
Which one?

108
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:34,013
She went to the new clinic.

109
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,115
It's on this flyer.

110
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,173
Here!

111
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,053
What the?!

112
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,776
Grandmother is late.
I wonder what happened?

113
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:04,877
Ma'am?

114
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,480
It seems like I'm the only elf here.

115
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,081
Ma'am?!

116
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:09,916
Yes?

117
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,385
You look so young. How old are you?

118
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,487
I'm eighteen.

119
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,045
Eighteen?!

120
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,393
Well, she is an elf, you know.

121
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,295
Oh, yeah!

122
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,696
I see...

123
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,731
So she's eighteen in elf years?

124
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,134
In human terms, she could be
hundreds of years old.

125
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,797
No, I mean it's only been eighteen
years since I was born.

126
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,477
Who are these people?

127
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:47,920
But if that's true, you're not officially
an adult, are you?

128
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,423
I wonder how you managed
to get married?

129
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,327
Well, we've been through a lot,
but we managed it somehow.

130
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:58,286
I see, it seems very complicated.

131
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:04,403
Oh, my name is Ion, I'm a mix
between human and jinro.

132
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:08,772
My husband is a quarter jinro, but
he has a lot of human relatives.

133
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,841
It's very difficult, you know.

134
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,916
But you know, Ion, at least in your
case it's the same two races.

135
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,119
Look at my situation...
My situation!

136
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:25,124
Since my boyfriend is part beast,
his thing is huge!

137
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,788
I'm gonna break apart!
I'm only a half-hobbit!

138
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,431
I can sympathize with her.

139
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,559
Noitie, you're always like this.

140
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,730
Is that all you have to worry about?

141
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,208
What do you mean, is that all?

142
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,710
This is a very serious problem!

143
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,013
I'm in deep trouble here!

144
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,716
What if our sex life doesn't
improve at all?

145
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,218
I...

146
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,520
...should've known someone who's
already past her prime

147
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,488
wouldn't understand my problem!

148
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,291
Well, let me tell you something!

149
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,962
My husband's only a quarter jinro, but
his thing is like a thoroughbred's!

150
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,463
When he puts his thing inside me,

151
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,564
it's so tight all the air rushes out,
"suka, suka."

152
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:10,126
Oh, "suka, suka!"
You're so naughty!

153
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,829
My, they're very open!

154
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,634
Faster, Silver!

155
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,780
So Kenji, you know the chief doctor?

156
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,615
You bet I know him!

157
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:26,676
His name is Perio.
We partied together once.

158
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:36,658
He used to be a mercenary soldier
who could also do medical magic.

159
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:44,070
His hobby was housewife hunting,
and he's the best there is.

160
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,072
Now he calls himself a gynecologist
and runs his own clinic,

161
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,907
but his true form is a perverted freak!

162
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,670
Milfa's in danger!

163
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,145
Ma'am, are you okay?

164
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:56,649
We must finish the examination, so you
can go back home to your husband.

165
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,777
No, please don't talk about
my husband.

166
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:06,790
Well now, this is really difficult. You...

167
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:14,062
...have already come so many times,
and you're still getting wetter.

168
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,471
I couldn't let you go now,
even if I wanted to.

169
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,407
Doctor, I...

170
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,410
What if rumors start about adultery
between myself

171
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,613
and a housewife with a good honest
reputation like yours?

172
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,116
No, please don't...

173
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,119
I, too, have to keep up my reputation
as an honest doctor.

174
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,554
So this will be my last time with you.

175
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,357
Please go home after this.

176
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,526
Yes, but...

177
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,495
Please, hurry!

178
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,186
Hisenkyo?

179
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,655
I just heard about this.

180
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:13,592
There's a fountain whose waters
accelerate body growth.

181
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,594
I did some research about it.

182
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:21,000
You see, I have certain problems
with my body size.

183
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,002
What is it called?

184
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,005
I can't seem to remember.

185
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,439
Estrogen?

186
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,843
Oh, yeah! That's it!
Ion, you know about this?

187
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,011
Some...

188
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,479
Do you know where it is?

189
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,881
Well, I...

190
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,851
Mrs. Milfa Links, the doctor
will see you now!

191
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,152
Yes!

192
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,287
Just a sec!

193
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,447
Yes?

194
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,391
I'm warning you because
you're so cute.

195
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,552
Be careful with that doctor.

196
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,897
Look at that lady who j ust
finished her consultation.

197
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,422
Thank you so very much.

198
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,306
You see how red her face is?

199
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:04,777
They say when he looks at you and
touches you that it feels really good.

200
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,541
He seems to be using some
sort of magic charm.

201
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,915
He's a very good doctor though.

202
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,883
But is he a molester?

203
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,288
Go ahead and yell if
something happens.

204
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,755
Okay!

205
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,229
I'm much more relaxed now.

206
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,992
Thank you very much!

207
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,938
She's so innocent.

208
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,173
Really!

209
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:39,945
And only a year ago, we were
newlywed wives just like her.

210
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,640
Whatever...

211
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,054
Hello, I'm Mrs. Links.

212
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,022
Nice to meet you.

213
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,358
How do you do, Mrs. Links?
I'm Dr. Perio.

214
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,058
Hurry up, Silver! Speed up!

215
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,307
Kenji, this is a dead end!

216
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,672
Jump, Silver!

217
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,744
Right at this moment, Milfa could be...

218
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,319
He looks so much like
his late grandfather.

219
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,064
So, you're having problems
with your husband

220
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,266
because of the size differential?

221
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,901
Yes...

222
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,469
I understand.

223
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,005
First, I'm going to give y ou
a simple check-up,

224
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,573
so please remove your clothes.

225
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,904
Oh, no!

226
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:47,540
Excuse me, but I don't have
any problem with my breasts.

227
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,950
Well, I'm sorry,

228
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,181
but I need to check your
general physical condition.

229
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,022
Oh, so that's it.

230
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,785
Kenji, I'm sorry.

231
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,088
Well then, please...

232
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,833
Beautiful...

233
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,336
Nice smooth skin and big breasts,

234
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:14,204
which is unusual for elves,
and a well proportioned body.

235
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,709
I like it!

236
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,044
I think I'll have her too.

237
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:23,582
If she falls for my charm eyes
she'll become my sex slave

238
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:26,551
even if she's the most dedicated
wife in the world.

239
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,424
Now then...

240
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,791
Don't! Please don't. Not like this.

241
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,639
Stop...

242
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,506
No!

243
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,024
Open your legs wider
and show it to me.

244
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,792
No! Not...

245
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,394
Here...

246
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,595
It hurts!

247
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,896
No!

248
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,194
Come on, open up.

249
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,297
No, don't look!

250
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,336
It's beautiful, Ma'am.

251
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,075
This is great, Ma'am.

252
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,736
No!

253
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,575
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

254
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:11,390
I'm fine, I'm sorry for taking so long.

255
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,416
Were you cold? Please forgive me.

256
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,863
We'll continue our examination
over here.

257
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,125
Okay...

258
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,029
I'm so glad he's such a nice doctor.

259
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,671
Almost there! Hang in there, Silver!

260
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,708
What's wrong? Run! Please, run!

261
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,857
Grandma!

262
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,896
I will shoot some of my spirit
into the hydra's body.

263
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,659
Hang on!

264
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,812
Go, Silver!

265
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,406
Oh, no! My legs will be
spread wide open!

266
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:17,189
Don't worry about a thing, a first time
patient is always nervous.

267
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,392
Just try to relax, I'm a
professional doctor.

268
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,860
There's no need to be embarrassed.

269
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,534
That's right, he IS a doctor!

270
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,036
He sees these poses all the time.

271
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,072
Like this, and this, and...
Oh, my God!

272
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,642
But... but I need to have this
examination done,

273
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,343
so he has to look at it.

274
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:43,248
Therefore... But I just can't bear to
have any one but Kenji see it!

275
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,251
No, be brave, Milfa!

276
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,754
Or else I shouldn't even be here!

277
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,221
Okay!

278
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,788
So, have you decided?

279
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,695
Lovely, fresh bride,

280
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,497
let me help you.

281
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,364
What is this eerie feeling?

282
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,597
Milfa!

283
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,612
I've changed my mind.

284
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,275
Now, don't be afraid.

285
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,578
I 've decided not to.

286
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,355
What's this?

287
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,950
My body is numb from the waist down,
and I can't get up!

288
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,824
Ma'am, you're just an undeveloped elf.

289
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:37,002
In human terms, you're only
about five years old.

290
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:41,530
Having sex right away with a body
like yours is an impossible task.

291
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,742
No!

292
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:48,543
Your body must first be developed by
stimulating all your sexual points.

293
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,520
Fortunately, your body has developed
faster than normal.

294
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:04,696
With my help, all your problems
will be solved.

295
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,459
Charm Eye!

296
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,867
Milfa!

297
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:16,031
What?! The power of my charm eyes
is being reflected back out!

298
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,806
What?

299
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,812
No way!

300
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,413
Kenji!

301
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,461
Honey!

302
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,733
Perio! You bastard!

303
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:46,193
Oh, damn! I can't believe Kenji
is her husband!

304
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,404
PERIO!

305
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,802
Kenji!

306
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,811
I'm fine now.

307
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,472
Is that so?

308
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,313
Milfa...

309
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,987
Newlyweds are so cozy, aren't they?

310
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,648
Ma'am? Are you okay?!

311
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,886
You pervert doctor!

312
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,705
I won't forgive you!

313
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,619
Stop!

314
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,087
Wait!

315
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,589
Stop!

316
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,284
Damn you!

317
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,067
You're finally here, Doctor!

318
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,302
Doctor, you told me
I was the only one!

319
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,804
You told me that too!

320
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,406
Me too!

321
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,466
Please ladies, let's discuss
this peacefully.

322
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,645
He's trying to escape!

323
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,147
Let's get him!

324
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,411
Stop!

325
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,451
Stop! Let's get him!

326
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,931
You must be Dr. Perio.

327
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:04,701
Don't be scared, I'll make you
feel really good.

328
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,583
My transformation is
about to melt away.

329
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,746
I must've used up way too much
