1
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:04,507
Once upon a time...

2
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:07,720
only 10 or so years ago...

3
00:00:08,488 --> 00:00:11,321
evil came forth in the city of Meihou.

4
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,194
In order to defeat that evil...

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,522
a warrior from the kingdom of magic...

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,125
alongside the magical warrior
he found in that city.

7
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:29,865
Combined their forces to seal the evil.

8
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:47,282
And...

9
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:51,258
it disappeared from the memories
of the people.

10
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:58,361
But the warriors knew it in their hearts...

11
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,832
that the seal was not perfect.

12
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:10,212
Septem Charm Magical Kanan Vol. 4

13
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,079
From Carmine with Love

14
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:25,297
It is nearing.

15
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:27,857
The moment fate has woven.

16
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:30,496
I trust you in case something happens.

17
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:35,073
Okay, I only follow your orders,
Master Bergamot.

18
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:46,449
Let's ride on that next! Over there!

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,318
You really like the scream machines.

20
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:52,623
I think I'll pass.

21
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:57,022
Come on, don't say that.
Come ride with me.

22
00:01:57,464 --> 00:02:00,399
So where is your boyfriend today?

23
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:03,359
Who are you talking about?

24
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:06,572
You're not fooling anyone, Natsuki.

25
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:08,764
That asshole isn't my boyfriend!

26
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:12,640
That asshole!

27
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:17,247
I got it! 10:00 at the front gate?

28
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:19,482
I'll see you tomorrow!

29
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:23,321
Meihou Rainbow Town...

30
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,781
I've always wanted to go there.

31
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,861
Natsuki!

32
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,920
Mafuyu wanted to know...

33
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:33,932
if we wanted to go
to Rainbow Town with her tomorrow.

34
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:36,366
Natsuki!

35
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:44,232
It's so soft.

36
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:51,109
And what, may I ask, are you doing?

37
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:55,079
It's not like that! I was doing some
investigating, but I slipped and...

38
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,552
Investigating my ass!

39
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:03,893
My goodness.

40
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:06,956
Chihaya?

41
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:10,493
That lecherous asshole.

42
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,906
Lecherous? Did something happen?

43
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:17,433
Something? Of course not,
there's couldn't have been anything!

44
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:19,568
Say, where did Mafuyu go to?

45
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:23,377
Mafuyu left to go to the restroom, why?

46
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,447
The restroom?

47
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:33,323
A flower in here?

48
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,551
Don't peek now.

49
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,947
I wonder if Chihaya's still pissed
about yesterday.

50
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:58,007
She left without even telling me.

51
00:03:59,019 --> 00:03:59,951
This voice is...

52
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,009
Mafuyu!

53
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:03,011
Mafuyu!

54
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:28,236
What the hell is that?
It's not a Seed human.

55
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:30,338
Why you!

56
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,348
Take this!

57
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:46,795
It worked!

58
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:52,995
Mafuyu!

59
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:56,298
Hang in there, Mafuyu!

60
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,573
Thank goodness.

61
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:05,949
Mafuyu!

62
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:11,421
Hot. My body's so hot!

63
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:14,492
Give me some of this, please.

64
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:21,828
Mafuyu's been captivated by the magic.

65
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:29,871
At this rate she'll be crushed by the energy.

66
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:39,042
In order to save Mafuyu...

67
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:42,583
I need to have sex with her
and absorb her power.

68
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:47,682
Mafuyu's awfully late.

69
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:49,419
She is, isn't she?

70
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:51,921
I'm going to go look for her.

71
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:54,323
Okay, Chihaya.

72
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,967
Now there's nothing to worry about.

73
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:04,059
Natsuki!

74
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:13,001
Chihaya, don't get the wrong idea,
this isn't what you think.

75
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:16,205
Natsuki, you...

76
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,487
Natsuki, I hate you!

77
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:28,089
Natsuki, you asshole!

78
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,356
Chihaya, wait up!

79
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:56,086
What's all this?

80
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,193
What are they?

81
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:04,253
Chihaya, listen to me.

82
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:07,199
Let's transform, Chihaya!

83
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:10,725
- But...
- We need to transform!

84
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:42,360
Carmine! Let's hurry and save everyone!

85
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:44,525
Carmine!

86
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:50,799
What are you doing
standing around? Hurry!

87
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:54,269
I got it.

88
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,321
Let go of those people!

89
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:19,827
Shoot!

90
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,297
Stop it!

91
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:03,708
Master Hazuna!

92
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:05,215
Carmine's in trouble! Let's go!

93
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:06,474
Yes!

94
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:09,577
Carmine!

95
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,392
Cerulean Boomerang!

96
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:31,707
The sparkle of justice of the deep blue sea!

97
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:33,808
Now's your chance, Carmine!

98
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,869
All right!

99
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:40,746
Carmine!

100
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:45,153
Eco-Shower!

101
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:53,888
No way!

102
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:56,824
Carmine!

103
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:05,066
Shit!

104
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,174
What is this? I can't fight back.

105
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:14,343
It's like it's sucking power out of me.

106
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,861
Carmine! Cerulean Blue!

107
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:28,325
Save me Natsuki!

108
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:34,599
Septem!

109
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,152
Why?

110
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:58,193
Follow me.

111
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:00,159
Wait!

112
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:03,491
Follow her!

113
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,468
Magical Kanan!

114
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,142
What are they?

115
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:16,905
They are Stamen.

116
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:19,307
As in the plant organ?

117
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,681
But why didn't the Eco-Shower work?

118
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:25,947
The energy of a magical warrior is love.

119
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:30,062
The stronger your faith is,
the stronger love becomes.

120
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:35,197
But Carmine has distrust surging
through her heart.

121
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:37,291
That is...

122
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:40,766
But Septem, why did you save us?

123
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,475
Isn't all that your doing?

124
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:47,035
I only follow the orders
of Master Bergamot.

125
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:48,479
Bergamot?

126
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:52,480
Is that the name of the person
who stole the Seeds from Ever Green?

127
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:54,041
That's right.

128
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:58,320
So you're the cause of all of this!

129
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:02,756
You're a resident of Ever Green aren't you?
Why did you do that?

130
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:06,661
I was sent to this city, Meihou,
under the order of Queen Tsuyuha.

131
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:09,667
My duty was to destroy
an evil presence there.

132
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:14,271
Long, long a ago, a Seed fell from
Ever Green to the earth by accident.

133
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:19,970
It absorbed the hatred
and malice of the humans.

134
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,671
And grew into a monster.

135
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:34,284
I met a girl who had the makings
of a magical warrior.

136
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:38,663
And we fought together.

137
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,065
But we could not destroy it.

138
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:49,840
How come?

139
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:54,405
If we had used the full power
of the magical warrior...

140
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:59,611
it would've been possible to destroy it.

141
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:03,551
But, that would mean killing the new soul
inside the magical warrior.

142
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:05,557
New soul?

143
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:10,351
That's right. Carmine.
You were inside that magical warrior.

144
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,957
Then, that means...

145
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,559
Make no mistake, I am your father.

146
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:19,571
Then Mama's a magic warrior?

147
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,803
So that's why Emi looks like her
when she was young.

148
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:27,035
I created Septem in the image
of Carmine's mother.

149
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:33,585
The time of resurrection is near.

150
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:38,212
If it awakens, our daughter,
having magic energy, we'll be attacked.

151
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,626
I stole the Seeds to give my daughter
the strength to prevent that.

152
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:47,594
So that's why you...

153
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:49,399
So that means...

154
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,198
Mafuyu.

155
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,069
Miyuri.

156
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,132
Tomoe.

157
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:57,976
Sai.

158
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:02,347
And Ayumi all went through
all that all because of me?

159
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,407
That's cruel.

160
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:07,618
That's too cruel!

161
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:09,678
Carmine!

162
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:12,957
You guys are all so selfish!

163
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,693
You couldn't beat it because I was there?

164
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:17,522
You're the ones who made me!

165
00:15:18,497 --> 00:15:22,729
Natsuki, too! You said you loved me,
and you did it with Mafuyu!

166
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:24,267
But that's...

167
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,132
You're all...

168
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:28,404
You're all...

169
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,303
so selfish!

170
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:32,032
Carmine!

171
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,508
Chihaya.

172
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:42,376
Stop it!

173
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,949
I'll protect everyone with my powers!

174
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:57,424
It's here!

175
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:03,965
Carmine!

176
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,504
Where am I?

177
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:19,549
This is what I've been yearning for.

178
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:21,993
Who are you?

179
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:27,925
The very magic you possess
is the key to my resurrection.

180
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:30,861
Your magic shall be mine.

181
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:35,064
No!

182
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:02,467
Such warmth. This is power.

183
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:20,351
Not enough.

184
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,910
More!

185
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:25,312
More!

186
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:32,587
Look! The bud is...

187
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:38,665
What's that?

188
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,750
She turned back into Chihaya!

189
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:54,882
It sucked up her magic!

190
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:06,558
- Septem!
- Yes?

191
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,226
Wait!

192
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:11,496
I leave it to you.

193
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:14,229
Bergamot!

194
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:31,714
Chihaya!

195
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,922
Natsuki.

196
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:36,890
Cerulean Blue.

197
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:41,164
And also, Septem.

198
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:51,871
Chihaya?

199
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,141
Chihaya. What's going on?

200
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,418
I was saved by Chihaya.

201
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,022
So was I.

202
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,227
Mafuyu's memories have returned!

203
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,556
The magic around here is getting weak!

204
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:17,499
Cerulean Blue!

205
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,164
Sayaka?

206
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,842
Mafuyu, Miyuri!

207
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:30,114
Please cheer Chihaya up!

208
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:32,114
What's going on?

209
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:36,177
Right now, Chihaya needs
our support more than ever.

210
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,124
Chihaya!

211
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,126
Hang in there, Chihaya!

212
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:44,960
Hang in there, Chihaya!

213
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,364
I can hear all of your voices.

214
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:56,074
Chihaya!

215
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:00,269
You have me and the others!

216
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:04,475
Chihaya! You were born because you
had a father and a mother!

217
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:06,818
You're the embodiment of love!

218
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:10,154
The embodiment...

219
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:11,921
of love?

220
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:16,251
Stop it!

221
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:33,874
Septem!

222
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:36,578
Septem, why?

223
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,240
I was created by Master Bergamot.

224
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,486
I follow the orders of Master Bergamot.

225
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:47,581
Septem!

226
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:51,530
Septem!

227
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:56,564
Chihaya!

228
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:07,404
Natsuki, hurry and come!

229
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:08,535
Give me strength!

230
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,439
Chihaya!

231
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:43,406
No! I hate the darkness!

232
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:54,048
Chihaya, purification!

233
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:57,318
No, there's no need for purification.

234
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:02,057
Chihaya!

235
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:10,331
Poor thing.
You were lonely, weren't you?

236
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,443
Carmine.

237
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:21,184
- No, this is...
- Yes.

238
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:22,876
That's it.

239
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:27,514
Bergamot!

240
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:56,820
Why?

241
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:01,585
My life was already at its end
when I stole the Seeds.

242
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:07,923
He attempted to evolve Carmine,
even at the cost of his own life.

243
00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:09,298
No.

244
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,297
It's okay, Chihaya.

245
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:16,933
It was destined to happen the moment
you formed inside your mother.

246
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:19,271
You had no choice in the matter.

247
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:23,108
I'm sorry to have made you go through this.

248
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:26,642
I will watch over you
and your mother from here.

249
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:28,383
Father!

250
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:54,243
Dear.

251
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:03,183
The inhabitants of Ever Green transmigrate
into a tree when they die.

252
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:08,449
But I've never seen such
a splendid one as this.

253
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:14,226
Hazuna, Natsuki, Chihaya.
You have done well.

254
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:24,874
I will plant this Seed
in the pure soil of Ever Green.

255
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:31,048
It will surely bloom beautiful flowers.

256
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:33,676
Natsuki?

257
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:36,477
Your duties have been fulfilled.

258
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:39,187
Return to Ever Green.

259
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:40,347
He can't!

260
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,722
I don't want that!

261
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:44,217
Chihaya.

262
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:47,487
I'm sorry.

263
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,491
Natsuki.

264
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:56,730
Natsuki!

265
00:24:57,676 --> 00:24:59,871
Natsuki!

266
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:03,372
Natsuki!
