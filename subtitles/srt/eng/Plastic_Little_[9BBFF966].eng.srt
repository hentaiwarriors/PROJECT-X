1
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,600
Put out that fire! The rest of you,
find Professor Nalerof!

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,300
Terminal force is sanctioned!

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,540
Have you found him?

4
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:31,800
Excellency Guizel, it will
be any minute now!
Have you found him?

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,570
Excellency Guizel, it will
be any minute now!

6
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,470
Make it soon.

7
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,070
Yes, Sir!
Make it soon.

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:36,940
Yes, Sir!

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,710
We've got him! Block 13!

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,130
Elysse, take this escape pod
up to the city levels!

11
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,730
Papa, what about you?

12
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll be right behind. There's
not much time.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,860
Go on. Get inside.

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,200
Elysse, live a long life. Thwart
Guizel's evil ambitions.

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,270
You've been a very foolish man,
Professor Nalerof.

16
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,220
Kill him.

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:19,650
Papa!
Kill him.

18
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,710
Papa!

19
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,330
I want to go to the beach!

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Oh yeah...

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,000
We're staying here 'cause the Cha
Cha Maru is in port for repairs.

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,780
What? Where is everyone?

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,480
Who cares?

24
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,050
Oh, nuts!

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,060
I've overslept!

26
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,390
Boing!

27
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,530
Mei! Nichol!

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,170
Mikhail! Balboa? Roger?

29
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,570
Hey, Nichol?

30
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,770
Jeez, they went and took
off without me again!

31
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,480
Hey, Tita, you lazy bum!

32
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,490
The rest of us are already
back at the ship!

33
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,990
Right!
The rest of us are already
back at the ship!

34
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,150
The rest of us are already
back at the ship!

35
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,860
Of course, even if you were here, you
wouldn't be doing anything!

36
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,530
That's why we left you behind!

37
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,760
And one more thing. If, as usual,
you're getting up about noon,

38
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,040
you might as well stop and pick
up our lunch on the way in.

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,500
We'll be seeing you!

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,240
This message was brought to you
by Nichol, your brilliant pilot.

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,740
Here I go!
This message was brought to you
by Nichol, your brilliant pilot.

42
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,070
This message was brought to you
by Nichol, your brilliant pilot.

43
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,940
Whoa!

44
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,880
Thanks!

45
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,410
Whee!

46
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,420
Mikhail! Mikhail!

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,750
How's it coming over there?

48
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,040
Almost finished. And you?

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
Well, maybe another day or two.

50
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,000
By the way, where is that idiot Roger?

51
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,680
I don't know.

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,110
Nichol, I'm dying from hunger.
I don't know.

53
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,140
Nichol, I'm dying from hunger.

54
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,740
No kidding, it's way past lunchtime.

55
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,710
I'm going to waste away, right here.

56
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,150
Even you can't starve that fast!

57
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,540
Oh, jeez!

58
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,030
Guess I bought a little too much.

59
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,300
Come on, get in there!

60
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,170
Finally, everything's loaded!

61
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,520
What in the world?

62
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,820
I'm sorry!

63
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,590
Oh, don't worry about it. I'm all right.

64
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,230
I'm so sorry.

65
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,570
What's her hurry?

66
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,040
Move it!

67
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,410
Who were they?

68
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,980
Today's just not going to be my day.

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,810
Abandoned, and now my tiny
little breasts get flattened...

70
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,420
Let go!

71
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:39,480
Bastards!
Let go!

72
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,880
Bastards!

73
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,060
Hop on, quickly!

74
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,200
But...
Hop on, quickly!

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
But...

76
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,570
But...
You're on the run, right? Come on!

77
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,860
You're on the run, right? Come on!

78
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,600
Damn! Stop them!

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,300
Hang on!

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,110
Right!
Hang on!

81
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,760
Right!

82
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,740
A-Unit! We have failed to
apprehend the subject.

83
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,410
B-Unit, where the hell is C-Unit?

84
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,440
Use your vehicles to block number 12!

85
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,750
Persistent!

86
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,490
Hold on tight!

87
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,870
Damn!

88
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,380
Call in the divers!

89
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,250
I'm sorry. There was an
unexpected complication,

90
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,980
and we couldn't risk more assertive
action here in the city, and...

91
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,860
All right. But I want them found
within twenty-four hours.

92
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,400
Otherwise, it'll be your body they
find floating in the river.

93
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,860
Yes, Sir!

94
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,630
Something must have happened to her!

95
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,870
There's no way she could be this late!

96
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,740
The hotel said she left before noon!

97
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,330
It's a guy, that's what it is.

98
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,880
She's out doing the old "in and out"
with some good looking stud...

99
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,370
Roger!

100
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,980
That's a dirty lie!

101
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,350
How do you know? What makes
you so sure, Nichol?

102
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,380
Well, because...

103
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,750
In any case, it's because of
her that we're starving!

104
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,630
She is rather late.

105
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,110
All right, all right! She's always
giving us grief,

106
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,300
but today I'll teach her a lesson!

107
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,220
Tita?!

108
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,090
Sorry about lunch. I lost it.

109
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,250
What?!

110
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,590
Nichol! Get her some water!
What?!

111
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,820
Nichol! Get her some water!

112
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,860
Yes!

113
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,320
No more for me, thanks.
I've swallowed enough.
Yes!

114
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,880
No more for me, thanks.
I've swallowed enough.

115
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,490
What happened?

116
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,420
Who's this girl, Tita?

117
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,900
It's a long story.

118
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,410
Don't worry, this is the crew
of the Cha Cha Maru.

119
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,870
They're all friends.

120
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,910
Tita, what happened to you?

121
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,280
Mei! I'm fine, but can you
take a look at her?

122
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,840
I think she took a hit.

123
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,350
Here, let me see you.

124
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,800
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

125
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,160
I just want to clean your wound.

126
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,900
Pretty girls shouldn't have
to carry scars. Right?

127
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,050
From the look of things,

128
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,890
I'd say you've had a rather
rough day, Tita.

129
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,190
Okay, you're all set.

130
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,390
I'm glad it was nothing serious.
Okay, you're all set.

131
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,360
I'm glad it was nothing serious.

132
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,450
Thank you.

133
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,820
Now, can you tell us why you
were being chased?

134
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,560
It's possible that Tita and the rest
of us might become involved.

135
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,000
Is there some reason you
can't talk about it?

136
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,780
By the way, what is your
name anyway?

137
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,520
I can't keep calling you
"Hey you!", right?

138
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,190
C'mon, please tell me.

139
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,780
If you don't, I'll just have
to give you a name.

140
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,300
All right, Tita, take your friend
down to the bathing area

141
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,100
before the both of you catch
your death of cold.

142
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,470
Yeah, great idea!

143
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,640
Let's get out of our wet things and to
the Ladies Sun-Bathing Facility.

144
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,740
By the way, you won't believe
the bathtub we've got here!

145
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,210
Come on! Let's go!

146
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,580
C'mon, c'mon! Hurry!

147
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:00,650
But...
C'mon, c'mon! Hurry!

148
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,250
But...

149
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,480
Did you see Tita?

150
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,750
Nude?
Did you see Tita?

151
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,940
Nude?

152
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,760
So, where's your house?

153
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,490
Don't you live on the island?

154
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,700
What are you doing?

155
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,150
Here.

156
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,720
Come on, let's go.

157
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,600
Well...

158
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,610
Just how old are you?

159
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,380
You could tell me your age, at least?

160
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,610
I'm sixteen.

161
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,710
Sixteen?

162
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,710
I'm a whole year older, but...

163
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,320
This is terrible!

164
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,150
I'm depressed. I'll never be
able to face the world.

165
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:52,120
Aw, what the hell! Let's go! Hurry up!

166
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,030
Yee Haw!

167
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,710
Boy, that was fun.

168
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,120
Wasn't that great?

169
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,210
We used up a whole containment
facility making this bathhouse!

170
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,430
Why did you rescue me? Who are you?

171
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,620
Oh, sorry, I guess I never told you.

172
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,830
My name's Tita Mu Koshigaya.

173
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,310
This ship's a pet shop hunter
and I'm its captain.

174
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,210
As for why I rescued you,
well, that's hard to say.

175
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,510
Is "I couldn't not do it," a
good enough answer?

176
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,640
There were a lot of soldiers
chasing me.

177
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,250
That's why I couldn't help myself.

178
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,490
I said to myself, she doesn't
look like a criminal.

179
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,250
Come on. Let's not do this, Roger.

180
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,970
This is a really bad idea.

181
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,740
Are you kidding? I thought you liked
Tita. Don't you want to see her?

182
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,870
Yeah! See!

183
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,240
Okay, here.
Yeah! See!

184
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,010
Okay, here.

185
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,410
What's this? A high-pressure
sea scope!

186
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,310
And with it, we can see everything, no
matter how thick the steam gets.

187
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,510
Use it.

188
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,190
What are you doing?

189
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,900
Excuse me...

190
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,300
What?
Excuse me...

191
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,350
What?

192
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,000
Just what does a pet shop hunter do?

193
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,740
Well, we capture the creatures that
live in the sea of clouds,

194
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,070
then sell them as pets to collectors
on other planets.

195
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,380
It's just animals, though.

196
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,640
See, there're some right above us.

197
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,550
You...

198
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,180
DIE!

199
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,830
I'm sorry about that.
Everything's fine now.

200
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,870
Those people are strange.

201
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,140
Really? Nah, just perverted and stupid.

202
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm too quick to jump to conclusions.

204
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,470
My name is Elysse.

205
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,110
Elysse Aldo Mordish.

206
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,740
Elysse... That's a nice name.

207
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,780
Did you find anything?

208
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,560
Take a look at this.

209
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,220
What?

210
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,300
What happened?

211
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,630
It's about that big accident
five days ago.

212
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,600
Look at the one underneath.

213
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,130
"Military sources confirmed that
Look at the one underneath.

214
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:43,970
"Military sources confirmed that

215
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,970
lab supervisor Professor Nalerof
Aldo Mordish and his daughter,

216
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,600
Elysse Aldo Mordish, perished
as a result of the accident."

217
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,640
What's that picture?!

218
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,120
That's a girl who's supposed
to be dead,

219
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,950
and the military's involved as well.

220
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,150
Am I the only one who smells
something nasty?

221
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,690
There's something going on.

222
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,210
Does Tita know?

223
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,490
I don't think so.

224
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,040
Great! We made it in time!

225
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,350
Look.

226
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,770
Gorgeous! I've never seen a
more beautiful sunrise.

227
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,240
That's cool!

228
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,870
Let's have breakfast now. I'm famished!

229
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,340
Yeah!

230
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,380
Balboa, your hunch was right.

231
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,120
The military are sniffing their
way across the harbor,

232
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,740
like they can scent Tita and Elysse.

233
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,920
That's not good. What if
they're already there?

234
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,120
Balboa, Tita's at Windmill Hill. Hurry!

235
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,590
Got it!

236
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,930
What's going on?

237
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,400
I don't know.

238
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,270
That was good.

239
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,130
I'm very glad.

240
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,670
I haven't enjoyed myself this
much in quite a while.

241
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,170
Not being out at sea was
starting to get me blue.

242
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,570
You like the sea more than the land?

243
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,380
Of course I do! I'm a pet
shop hunter after all!

244
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,310
Chasing cloud whales across
the sea of clouds is my life!

245
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,270
...and then Nichol got himself stung
by the cloud jelly snake!

246
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,030
He touched it with his bare hand
and was numb for two hours!

247
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,840
But why do the job at all,
Tita? I mean...

248
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,240
Chalk it up to my father's influence.

249
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,770
He was a pet shop hunter too.

250
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,820
With this same crew.

251
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,290
Was?

252
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,580
He went out one day when I was
about six. He never came back.

253
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,030
They said it was an accident.

254
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,290
There was a major malfunction
in the engine section.

255
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,230
He saved everyone by jettisoning it,
with himself inside.

256
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,440
He vanished into the sea of clouds.

257
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,840
We searched for about a year, but
under those circumstances...

258
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,380
But you don't believe
he's dead, do you?

259
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,550
What? I'm not sure, but...

260
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,820
Sometimes I get the feeling part of him
is still out there, somewhere.

261
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,310
I guess that's why I do what I do.

262
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,950
I hope I can learn to feel that way.

263
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,400
I think I like you, Tita.

264
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,440
What the? That's...

265
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,610
An armored assault craft!

266
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,850
Look out!

267
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,090
Get me there in time!

268
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,360
Too late!

269
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,890
Tita! Where are you? Tita!

270
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,300
Damn! They're in the city!

271
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,880
I'm sorry, Tita.

272
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,350
What?

273
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,350
I'm sorry I got an innocent bystander
caught up in this.

274
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,150
I'm not a bystander!
Don't worry about it!

275
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,640
Lousy bastards!

276
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,690
Tita, listen to me.

277
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,090
One week ago, there was an accident
in a laboratory section

278
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,560
at the base of the colony.

279
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,970
In actuality, a terrible weapon
attached to the gravity belts

280
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,530
was activated.

281
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,240
Tell me about this later.

282
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,270
I've got to tell you now!

283
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,230
That accident was caused by my
father, Nalerof Aldo Mordish.

284
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,350
This colony is kept afloat
in the sea of clouds

285
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,290
by gravity belts supplied by the I.D.P.

286
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,950
For the last ten years,

287
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,890
the military has been developing
new uses for those belts,

288
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,880
while keeping the information from
the civilian government.

289
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,990
My father, a scientist, was
employed by the military.

290
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,890
He'd already completed his research
when he realized the truth.

291
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,140
His dream of making a better
life for everyone

292
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,300
had been twisted into a monstrous
weapon by Guizel.

293
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,900
Then my father...

294
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,810
Destroyed the weapon and helped
you escape. Right, Elysse?

295
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,820
Then, where's your father now?

296
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,550
He's dead. The military killed him.

297
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,160
I'm sorry, Tita. We couldn't bring
your father back with us.

298
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,070
I understand.

299
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,400
Tita, let me off now!
I understand.

300
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,770
Tita, let me off now!

301
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,100
I can't let you do this!

302
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,370
Tita, you're the first friend
I've ever had!

303
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,110
And you're my friend.

304
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,290
Because you're my friend, I'm not
going to let you give up!

305
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,350
Elysse, I'll protect you!

306
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,820
Tita...

307
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,160
Was that...

308
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,080
You've led me on quite a chase.

309
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,620
Now, give me the password.

310
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,560
I don't know anything
about a password!

311
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,490
All right then. Let me
jog your memory.

312
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,690
Elysse, tell me now or else...

313
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,330
Stop! I really don't know!

314
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,080
Stop it!

315
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,380
Tita! Tita!

316
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,620
Her hunter-suit's a good one.

317
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,890
Even more bulletproof than
the military versions,

318
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,290
but what about her internal organs?

319
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,760
Stop, please!

320
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,290
Now do you remember the password?

321
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,060
I really don't know the password!

322
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,570
I have to do an analysis first.

323
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,800
If I could go back to the lab...

324
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,940
And in return, you expect
me to spare her?

325
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,740
All right, but I want to know
the procedure now.

326
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,480
Don't tell him.

327
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,910
Tita!

328
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:09,980
You're dead as soon as you talk.
Tita!

329
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,910
You're dead as soon as you talk.

330
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,750
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,890
Land the assault craft.

332
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,360
The password for reactivating the
gravity destruction weapon

333
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,960
is the last twelve digits produced
by an analysis of my DNA

334
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,430
using the BRG exchange method.

335
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,470
Tita!

336
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,770
Liar! You said you'd spare her!

337
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,210
So sorry.

338
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:35,270
Tita! Tita!
So sorry.

339
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,430
Tita! Tita!

340
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,300
TITA!

341
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,950
What?

342
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,130
Tita!

343
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:55,360
A smoke screen?
Tita!

344
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,430
A smoke screen?

345
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:56,630
A smoke screen?
Tita! Elysse!

346
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,060
Tita! Elysse!

347
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,570
A pet shop hunter?

348
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,000
Balboa, a bomb just went
off at the hotel.

349
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,480
This'll be the next place to get
torched. How's Tita?

350
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,810
Old man, we can't stay any longer,
the ceiling will go any second!

351
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,080
Mikhail, go on, get out of there!
I'll bring these two!

352
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,060
Got it!

353
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,620
It's all right.

354
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,420
None of her internal organs were
ruptured, fortunately.

355
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,320
It's all my fault. All mine...

356
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,100
Don't worry yourself over it.
Tita is going to be all right.

357
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,720
Don't die. Don't die, Tita!

358
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,040
Mei, is Tita... Is Tita okay?

359
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,040
She'll be all right, but
she's sleeping now.

360
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,980
Go ahead, keep an eye on Tita for me.

361
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,450
Thank you!

362
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,110
Call me if anything happens.

363
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,020
Tita...

364
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,260
How's Tita?

365
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,490
She's doing fine.
How's Tita?

366
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,700
She's doing fine.

367
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:38,760
She's doing fine.
I see. That's good.

368
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,200
I see. That's good.

369
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,200
And now, Miss Elysse, I think it's
time you tell us everything.

370
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,670
Yes!

371
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,570
You can wake up now, Elysse.

372
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,080
How'd it go? Did you find anything?

373
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,670
Yes, but it will take a little time.

374
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,820
I see.

375
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,850
Where are you going?

376
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,420
I need some air.
Where are you going?

377
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,650
I need some air.

378
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,280
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mikhail.

379
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,220
I was just staring at the clouds.

380
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,900
So, what's the story?

381
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,040
What do you think?

382
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,270
About what?
What do you think?

383
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,370
About what?

384
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:23,540
About what?
About Tita.

385
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,840
About Tita.

386
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,570
She's like her father.

387
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,310
That's not what I'm talking about!

388
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,050
What are you asking?

389
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,520
This whole thing. What happened
to Tita and the rest of us...

390
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,680
It's all just too much.

391
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:45,330
Our job is hunting animals.
We're not professional soldiers.

392
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,390
Tita just hasn't figured it out yet.

393
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,100
You used to be in the military,
didn't you?

394
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,900
If you're getting cold feet,
why are you still here?

395
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,400
Why'd you bother coming back at all?

396
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,780
Old man...

397
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,850
Listen to this!

398
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,950
Now, if you can't believe
in the captain,

399
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,090
get the hell off this ship!

400
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,860
Hold it! That's not what I said!

401
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,560
But we're up against military
professionals.

402
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,620
There's no second chance, and if
Tita is killed, it's all over.

403
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,800
I won't let that happen.

404
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:30,240
Even if the cost is our lives,
I'll never let Tita die.

405
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,420
Ouch!

406
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,920
Twice in one day!

407
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,030
You bastard!

408
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,500
Tita... Don't die, Tita...

409
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,810
Nichol... He stood watch,
all through the night.

410
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,280
Thank you.

411
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,260
Tita! You shouldn't be up yet!

412
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,690
It's okay. I feel fine!

413
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,930
Tita!

414
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,840
Tita?

415
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,340
Miss?
Tita?

416
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,340
Miss?

417
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,240
Sorry I had you all worried.

418
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,580
Are you sure you're all right?

419
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,440
Yeah! Top of the world! I feel
like I can do anything!

420
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,440
Tita, what's our next
move going to be?

421
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,910
Mei's already clued me in.

422
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,560
We're going to take these bastards on,

423
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,090
and pay them back with interest!
One hundred times!

424
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,130
Yeah! Let's do it, Tita!

425
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,330
Tita...
Yeah! Let's do it, Tita!

426
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,730
Tita...

427
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,200
Come on, Elysse!

428
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,490
Let's do it for your father!

429
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,540
Tita...

430
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,970
If my dad were alive, he'd
have done the same.

431
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,340
Right! Everyone take your positions!

432
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,850
Aye aye, Sir!

433
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,310
Come on!

434
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,480
Ready to jump ship, Balboa?

435
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,500
Everybody on this tub is
out of their mind.

436
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,960
What?

437
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,330
Myself included.

438
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,570
Looks like I've fallen under
Tita's spell as well.

439
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,630
You won't die alone.

440
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,740
When we break into Heaven,
I'll take the point.

441
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,710
Thanks.

442
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,990
What? Tita? Where is she?

443
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,490
Hey! Tita!

444
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,390
You're getting slow, Nichol!

445
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,320
Tita!

446
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,630
Prepare to submerge!

447
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,090
What? We're diving?

448
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,060
Just a duel with the military.

449
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,100
Say what?!

450
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,940
Sonar response! Target vessel
cruising in at point 0-6522.

451
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,970
It must be the Cha Cha Maru, Sir.

452
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,320
All ships, go to cruising depth.
Standard pursuit formation.

453
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,550
Going to cruising depth.
Standard pursuit formation.

454
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,270
Block 8, partition C-2, partition D-1,

455
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,830
Block 2, partition B-2 closed!

456
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,210
It looks bad, Tita. The ship
can't take any more.

457
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,870
Right!

458
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,500
Come on, Elysse!

459
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,340
What?!

460
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:54,810
You're committing yourself
to certain death, Tita!
What?!

461
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,910
You're committing yourself
to certain death, Tita!

462
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,480
But the Cha Cha Maru
can't get any closer,

463
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,190
our best bet for stopping that thing
is through the upper levels!

464
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,920
We'll go, then!

465
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,490
Wait! The Cha Cha Maru can't
function without you, Balboa,

466
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,660
and right now I'm about as useful
as a fifth wheel! So...

467
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,930
But...

468
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,160
Please, let me do this! I've got
to take care of it myself.
But...

469
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,260
Please, let me do this! I've got
to take care of it myself.

470
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,530
Do you swear you'll come back?
Really come back?

471
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,630
All right, go!

472
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,150
Until you get back, we'll defend
this ship with our lives!

473
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,610
Thanks!

474
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,280
Tita, be careful.

475
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,120
Nichol, let's kick some military butt!

476
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,610
You must be joking!

477
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,630
Hurry, hurry!

478
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,260
Prepare the low-pressure pulse net,
Nichol! Maximum output!

479
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,700
Starboard side, simultaneous operation:
eject floater gyro,

480
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,970
and launch a thermal limpet from
the lower tyrail hatch!

481
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,900
All right, fire!

482
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,780
Showtime!

483
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,410
This isn't good. We can't
get any nearer

484
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,880
to the control room with
all this security.

485
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,250
Oh yeah, in the gravity-reactor section

486
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,950
there should be emergency sub-panels
every 150 feet or so.

487
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,250
We should be able to disengage
the device from there.

488
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,650
How do we get there?

489
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:43,750
Through the ventilation ducts.
How do we get there?

490
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,120
Through the ventilation ducts.

491
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,950
Okay, let's go.

492
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,060
Commander, we're about to finish
inputting the password.

493
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,070
Good. As soon as it's ready, set the
parameters to the city levels.

494
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,040
Yes, Sir!

495
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,580
What's the status on those
damned intruders?
Yes, Sir!

496
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,310
What's the status on those
damned intruders?

497
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,180
We lost track of them ten minutes ago.

498
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,380
We're making every attempt
to find them, Sir.

499
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,210
Ten minutes? Is it possible?

500
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,130
Where are we?

501
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:28,460
This is the colony's core,
Where are we?

502
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,230
This is the colony's core,

503
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,630
where the reactor that feeds the
gravity belts is housed.

504
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,410
We're on the underside of
a giant spinning top,

505
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,970
whose axis extends over 25 kilometers
from top to bottom.

506
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,710
From this emergency sub-panel,

507
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,380
which leads to the main panel
in the control room,

508
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,820
we should be able to access the
gravity destruction weapon.

509
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,510
Password input accepted.

510
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,290
Diffusion attract to be activated at
target point plus 100 meters.

511
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:59,320
All workers are to complete their
assignments and leave the area.

512
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,030
I can't do it from this terminal.

513
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,540
What do we try now?

514
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,000
Wait a second!

515
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,810
Got it!

516
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,480
There's a terminal 200 meters below us

517
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,500
that should accept the emergency
disengage password.

518
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,780
Look out, Elysse!

519
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,650
Bastard!

520
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,820
I guess we don't have time
to debate the issue.

521
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,490
Commander, we have an
activation on laser 252!

522
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,960
It could be the intruders!

523
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,690
Now we have them!

524
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,500
Redirect the troops in blocks 3 and 4
to the gravity reactor area.

525
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,860
I'm going too.

526
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,000
Wow! It won't stop!
I'm going too.

527
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,690
Wow! It won't stop!

528
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,870
Please stop... stop!

529
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,840
Stop! Oh, please!

530
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,700
That was cutting it close,
don't you think?

531
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,350
Oh well... Hold on tight, Elysse!

532
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,390
Hurry!

533
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,730
Hold it right there, little mice.

534
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,670
Damn! Just one more step...

535
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,450
You brats have caused us a great
deal of inconvenience,

536
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,150
especially for a pet shop hunter.

537
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,250
I just wanted to make sure you
got what's coming to you!

538
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,290
How stupid can you be?

539
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,560
You'll live just long enough
to regret defying me.

540
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,810
Balboa, the gravity belt!

541
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,240
You didn't make it, Tita?

542
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,850
What are we going to do, Balboa?
The ship's falling apart!

543
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,320
We can only wait.

544
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,330
In just a few minutes,

545
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,590
the people in the city levels
will begin to die.

546
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,730
And, knowing so much about it,
you'll have to die as well.

547
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,230
Shoot the intruders!

548
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,330
Elysse, get down!

549
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,300
We're saved!

550
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,760
Elysse!

551
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,830
You were hit?

552
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,710
It's nothing. How about you, Tita?

553
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,670
I'm all right.

554
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:40,240
Now you brats have really
gone and done it.

555
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,250
I'll take care of Guizel.

556
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,190
In the meantime, you input
the password, Elysse.

557
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,660
Okay.

558
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,060
Don't move, Guizel!

559
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,960
I'm not letting you get away
with this, you bastard!

560
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,360
How very humorous!

561
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,850
How could you have hoped
to overcome me?

562
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,310
Tita!

563
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,880
Password...

564
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,620
Hurry, Elysse!

565
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,110
You go first!

566
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,390
Three!

567
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,560
Two!

568
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,430
One!

569
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,890
ZERO!

570
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,470
Tita!

571
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,410
You can do it, Tita!

572
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,470
Thanks, Elysse.

573
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,420
I thought you were dead!

574
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,730
Diffusion attract password
has been inputted.

575
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,000
Tita...

576
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,870
Tita...
To disengage, depress the G-button
within three hundred seconds,

577
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,970
Go ahead and push the button.
To disengage, depress the G-button
within three hundred seconds,

578
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,110
But this is...
To disengage, depress the G-button
within three hundred seconds,

579
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,840
To disengage, depress the G-button
within three hundred seconds,

580
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,070
Tita, this is happening because of you.
To disengage, depress the G-button
within three hundred seconds,

581
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,970
Tita, this is happening because of you.
as described in the guidelines.

582
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,940
I'm here because of you, Tita, so...
as described in the guidelines.

583
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,340
I'm here because of you, Tita, so...

584
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,350
But... No way!

585
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,320
Please, do it with your own hand, Tita!

586
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:42,570
Dad, it's over. It's all over now.

587
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,240
Thank you, Tita.

588
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,550
Okay! Let's get back to the ship!

589
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,450
Right!

590
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,430
It's over, right?

591
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:07,660
Yeah, it's over.
It's over, right?

592
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,490
Yeah, it's over.

593
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:14,560
Okay! Let's leave the
military in the dust!

594
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,710
Let's run away!

595
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,170
Roger!

596
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:25,510
What?! His excellency,
Guizel, is dead?

597
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,150
We'll be up to our hips in it if the
Government finds out!

598
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,620
This could be trouble.

599
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,990
All ships! Battle stations!

600
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,930
Target that hunting ship
directly ahead!

601
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,190
Don't let them get out of here alive!

602
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,360
Begin firing!

603
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:49,100
Tita, they're shooting at us.
1,205 homing lasers, 3,852 torpedoes!

604
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,670
Okay! Engage the main engines!

605
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,580
Forward full power to coordinate 125!

606
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,270
Let's go right through them!

607
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,050
Balboa! I'll be needing a simultaneous
launch of the number 4 pulsenet!

608
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,710
Let's rock!

609
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,830
Did we get them?

610
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,630
Shoot! Shoot!

611
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:16,900
But, Sir...
Shoot! Shoot!

612
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,530
But, Sir...

613
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,130
But, Sir...
I don't give a damn! Destroy
that ship no matter what!

614
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,190
I don't give a damn! Destroy
that ship no matter what!

615
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,970
150 meters to fleet.

616
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,970
Take her in, full throttle!

617
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:40,280
This is insane! Dodging bullets
in the middle of a fleet!

618
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,330
I won't let you live!

619
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,600
Old man!

620
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,510
Are you all right?

621
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,410
Idiot! Never leave your position.

622
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,810
Are you mad?

623
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:07,920
Tita, the engines will blow
if you keep this up!

624
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,750
But...

625
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,720
Tita, the distance between them and
us is getting pretty small!

626
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,120
What can I do?

627
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,730
It's a one in a million chance, but...

628
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,270
Roger, in one minute... No, in thirty
seconds, give me full power!

629
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,400
I can't!

630
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,770
Go ahead, Tita!
I can't!

631
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,770
Go ahead, Tita!

632
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:26,900
Go ahead, Tita!
Mikhail!

633
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,540
Mikhail!

634
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,740
Let us take care of it.

635
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,210
Okay! Nichol!

636
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,680
I know!

637
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,340
You want me to set a course
for that whirlpool, right?

638
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,410
Go in from point 102, riding
the current to the center.

639
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,550
Balboa, I want all the ship's energy

640
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,090
focused through the main forward
radar assembly!

641
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,560
We're inducing a temporary shutdown
of the main engine limiters!

642
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,790
Hang on to your seats!

643
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,630
What are you doing? After them!

644
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,510
Stop the engine!

645
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,810
Let the current take her to the
center of the whirlpool!

646
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:09,310
Balboa, on my signal,

647
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,080
release all the energy through
the pulse radar assembly!

648
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,380
What?! The ship will...

649
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,090
Oh, I get it! There is a way...

650
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,460
Got it!

651
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:20,590
We're lined up on axis!
Countdown, five seconds!
Got it!

652
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,650
We're lined up on axis!
Countdown, five seconds!

653
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:23,930
FIRE!

654
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:24,730
Four!
FIRE!

655
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:24,890
Four!

656
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,760
Three!

657
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,730
Two!

658
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,660
One!

659
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,430
Zero!

660
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,900
Fire!

661
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,570
Mei, could you take a look
at my wounds too?

662
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,130
Can't you wait just a moment, Mikhail?

663
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,030
There, all done.

664
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,500
Thank you, Mei.

665
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:17,610
You and Tita ought to be more
careful with your bodies.

666
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,980
That scar may not fade completely.

667
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,650
That's all right. I'd like to keep it.

668
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,250
It's sort of like a medal of honor.

669
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,930
Whatever! I give up!

670
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,500
Tita...

671
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,960
Elysse?

672
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,030
It's beautiful.

673
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,430
Yeah, a gorgeous sunset.

674
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,740
Can I ask you something, Tita?

675
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,210
What?

676
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,000
Why? Why did you do all this for me?

677
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,620
Guizel and the gravity belts weren't
the most important part.

678
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,150
There was something I liked about
you the first time we met.

679
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:07,900
I just wanted to be your friend, Elysse.

680
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,270
When I looked at you,

681
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,560
I saw the same look I saw in my eyes,
five years ago.

682
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,400
The look of a girl who's just
lost her father.

683
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,110
I guess that's it.

684
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,650
I didn't want you to end up
like me, Elysse,

685
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,410
never quite able to get over it.

686
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,220
Hey, Elysse...

687
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,780
Would you like to stay on this ship?

688
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,360
You could join the crew, we could
be together. Well?

689
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,900
No, I think I'll go back to the island.

690
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:54,210
Like you, Tita, I've inherited
something from my father.

691
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,380
I want to build a gravity belt that
will really benefit civilization.

692
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,850
So...

693
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,920
Yeah, you're right.

694
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,760
Man, does that mean someday

695
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,160
I'm going to have to deal with this
whole stupid business again?

696
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,960
All right! If that's how it's
going to be, Elysse,

697
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,060
let's have a going away party!

698
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,500
The time is 20:46. The period of
emergency has passed...

699
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,060
The one who's closest to my heart

700
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,810
I chose in my young innocence

701
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:05,580
I love to see your soft face beside me

702
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:11,450
I'm so happy and I'm so glad

703
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,760
That I have lived this life of mine

704
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:22,660
It's been enough just
to have known you

705
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:27,070
I'm on top of the world

706
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:31,640
I feel I could do anything
I set my heart upon

707
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:39,950
If you asked, I could ride on the wind

708
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,720
You are everything

709
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,020
There's no other person like you

710
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,090
You're totally irreplaceable to me

711
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:54,620
Pull me against the firmness
of your sweet breast

712
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,070
I want to be the one

713
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:06,100
Who's the only one for you

714
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:22,020
I'm on top of the world

715
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,630
I feel I could do anything
I set my heart upon

716
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:36,970
If you asked, I could ride on the wind

717
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,670
You are everything

718
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,940
If we believe in ourselves

719
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,010
And the sweet bonds
that tie us invisibly

720
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:52,610
We can make it all work if we just try

721
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,960
You are everything

722
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,330
There's no other person like you

723
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:01,300
You're totally irreplaceable to me

724
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:07,900
Pull me against the firmness
of your sweet breast

725
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,370
I want to be the one

726
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,710
Who's the only one for you

727
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,510
You are everything

728
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,680
If we believe in ourselves

729
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,450
And the sweet bonds
that tie us invisibly

730
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:31,390
We can make it all work if we just try

731
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,660
You are everything

732
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,030
There's no other person like you

733
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:40,000
You're totally irreplaceable to me

734
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,370
Pull me against the firmness
of your sweet breast

735
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:50,710
This may be my ocean

736
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:57,990
But I'll share it with you
