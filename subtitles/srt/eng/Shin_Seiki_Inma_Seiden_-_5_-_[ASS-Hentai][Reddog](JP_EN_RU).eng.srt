1
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:42,881
Mao!

2
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:45,958
Wow.

3
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,836
Mr. Kameyama!

4
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:22,356
Mao!

5
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:29,130
Mao! Hang on!

6
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:33,264
Mom, look what they did to Moeka.

7
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:34,362
Mao.

8
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,476
What the hell is going on
around here?

9
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:35,357
HOLY WAR AGAINST THE DEVIL

10
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:36,761
THE FIFTH PART

11
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:47,605
It's so boring!

12
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:48,748
Mao?

13
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,418
Watch out, Himiko.

14
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,354
She wants to kill you.

15
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:04,419
You are born by Rikako and I.

16
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,234
I don't want to hear about this.

17
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:15,871
Himiko wants to utilize your body
to resurrect Rikako.

18
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:20,305
She couldn't take control of Rikako
when she was alive.

19
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,238
So she decided to let her die
and then take control of her.

20
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:27,750
That's none of my business!
Don't bother me!

21
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:34,088
You're the daughter
of the Ootori family after all.

22
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,627
You just brood on your difficulties...

23
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:38,823
and never listen to the advice of others.

24
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:41,490
Even knowing that might cause destruction.

25
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:45,060
Sena! Suzune! Moeka!

26
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:46,672
Don't leave me!

27
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,481
It's indeed hard to understand
human beings.

28
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:02,647
Know what I'm talking about?

29
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:13,230
Although I don't understand
what Himiko's purpose is...

30
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,268
it's true she caused the trouble.

31
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:17,534
It's just...

32
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:18,865
Just what?

33
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:22,697
I'm kind of worried about
how Kaori behaves recently.

34
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:27,503
I found out she's weird, it seems
something related to her sister Mao.

35
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:31,214
Can't let this keep going on like this!

36
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:35,683
We've got to make a deal with Kaori,
and stop Himiko!

37
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:36,946
Understand?

38
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:42,557
If it doesn't work, then
kill Fujio's family, the Kameyamas.

39
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:46,925
Kill the Ootoris of Kaori as well
if it's necessary!

40
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:49,629
You do whatever it takes.

41
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:52,601
So, Kaori, Mao was...

42
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:56,965
My mother was utilizing
Mao's body for her incarnation...

43
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,577
it wasn't me.

44
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:00,743
How come it was Mao?

45
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,075
I don't understand all of this.

46
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:05,944
Hey! Ayano is it...

47
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,889
Ayano, my sister?

48
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:13,651
Yes.

49
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,533
Hitomi, come with me.

50
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,693
- I need you.
- Okay, then.

51
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:31,708
Ayano, you saw something
you shouldn't have seen.

52
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:34,577
I know Kaori, but...

53
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:38,313
I swear, I didn't tell anyone about that.

54
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,715
So...

55
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:54,422
Darn you.

56
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:55,995
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,703
No!

58
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:04,499
Are you okay?
Hurt yourself, Ayano?

59
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:06,908
Get away from me!

60
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,179
Good girl, take it easy, Ayano.

61
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:17,316
- Stop it! Sister!
- Mao!

62
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:18,118
Ayano!

63
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:19,753
Mao!

64
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:23,224
Mao, you shouldn't have come here.

65
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:25,025
It wasn't a good idea.

66
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,530
I'll take care of Ayano.

67
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:35,096
Sister, what did you want to do to Ayano?

68
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:52,147
That's great, over there!

69
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,066
I can't stand it.

70
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:09,571
I'm coming!

71
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:21,620
Just one more if all the weapons
had been collected.

72
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,217
Everything would be under my control.

73
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:29,751
Himiko?

74
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,932
What's wrong with you, Himiko?

75
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:38,134
Himiko, you're not acting normal.

76
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:41,964
Sister Rikako.

77
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:46,170
You said you're going to be
with me forever.

78
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:49,775
No way!

79
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:52,875
It's your duty to protect the Ootori.

80
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:03,651
Rikako.

81
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:06,391
Himiko.

82
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:16,032
Rikako, don't get married.

83
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,976
Himiko, you're really spolied.

84
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:23,013
Don't say something stupid.

85
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:25,717
Fujio's a great guy.

86
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:31,413
I hate that ugly guy!

87
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:33,925
Himiko, no!

88
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,922
I still have to say something.

89
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:41,690
If I let you be touched
by another man I would rather...

90
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,901
I would rather kill you!

91
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,633
Don't talk nonsense.

92
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:56,441
I love you.

93
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,149
Himiko.

94
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:05,351
- I love my sister.
- Rikako!

95
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,053
Himiko!

96
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:26,108
If all the weapons had been collected,
then Rikako would belong to me again.

97
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:32,477
After the ritual at Benzaiten Shrine
has been done...

98
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:37,921
all the plates underground
will combine together.

99
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:46,292
If this going to happen
wouldn't it become trouble?

100
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:51,926
Got to ask Uncle Fujio about this.

101
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,902
Got to ask him.

102
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:57,903
Ask that guy?

103
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,579
I don't know
what Himiko's purpose is...

104
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:04,273
it feels so good!

105
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:10,548
But her available resources are limited.

106
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:11,646
I'm coming.

107
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:16,723
Auntie Himiko.
I won't let you make it.

108
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:25,533
Sister, Hitomi.

109
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:28,502
What the hell is everyone thinking about?

110
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:31,343
Mao.

111
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:35,603
It seems that you don't believe
it's Auntie Himiko who caused this matter.

112
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:37,606
Am I right?

113
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:41,643
You should have known
the duties of our Ootori family.

114
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:46,418
It's worshiping Dakini Goddess
and protecting Eurasia.

115
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:49,825
But Auntie Himiko made us
use the students as sheaths...

116
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,328
in order to obtain the weapons...

117
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:53,456
then keep offering them
to the Buddha Gods.

118
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:57,091
Consequently, a shift of rank
among the Buddha Gods is happening.

119
00:10:57,337 --> 00:11:00,773
It'll cause the plates transform
of Eurasian Continent as a result.

120
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,502
And constantly cause disasters
all over the world.

121
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:08,236
Therefore, no matter our Ootori family
or the Kameyamas...

122
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:10,642
one family should be vanished.

123
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:13,650
It isn't true, is it?

124
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,551
It is true, Mao.

125
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:18,588
Hitomi is a child of the Kameyamas.

126
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,524
What if...

127
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:26,526
If Auntie Himiko was the one
who killed Moeka?

128
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:28,796
Then I'm...

129
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:31,796
I'm not going to forgive you!

130
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:34,900
Auntie Himiko!

131
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:37,838
Hitomi!

132
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,976
Just ask me if you have any questions.

133
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:42,170
Where is Auntie Himiko?

134
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:43,849
Stop yelling!

135
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,250
Don't you understand, Hitomi!

136
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:49,911
If this is going to happen, do you know
what you would become?

137
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:52,751
Mind your own business, Hitomi.

138
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,284
And then what?

139
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:59,189
I'll become like Sena and Suzune,
got killed by Tetsumask?

140
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:01,097
Hitomi!

141
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,597
Are you related to Tetsumask?

142
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:05,527
It can't be true!

143
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:09,230
Okay, Mao, if you want to stop
my mother...

144
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:14,039
Even if it's you,
you know I'll not let you go!

145
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:16,447
Namu!

146
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:20,951
Hitomi!

147
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,254
Yes?

148
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:25,280
Hitomi and your sister, well, well.

149
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:30,988
What's the deal that Head Temple
offered to Ootori?

150
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:32,724
I've got to stop them both.

151
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,697
I've got something to do now.

152
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,301
And furthermore...

153
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:39,995
I guess Hitomi wouldn't really hurt Mao.

154
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,776
What do you really want to do, Hitomi?

155
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:50,605
You're such an unbelievably
simpleminded fool.

156
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:53,780
I'll go and die...

157
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:57,586
if my dear mother
wants me to do so.

158
00:12:57,757 --> 00:13:00,590
I'll go and kill if my dear mother
wants me to do so.

159
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:17,599
Now, can I eat her?

160
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:20,538
Mao, how was that?

161
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:25,248
Make a promise, never interfere with
what my mother would do.

162
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:27,180
Don't be such a damn fool!

163
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:30,086
How can I stand aside
when my friends are being killed?

164
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:31,517
Really?

165
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:34,656
What do you want, Hitomi?

166
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:36,954
To make you become nicer.

167
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:38,586
Stop it!

168
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:42,264
No, don't! I'm going to get angry!

169
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:45,437
Look how interested you are, little girl.

170
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:47,971
Mao, I'm really sorry, I am.

171
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:50,606
Because you won't listen to me.

172
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:53,106
I beg you, please!

173
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:56,670
No!

174
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:03,851
You bastard!

175
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:10,987
What the hell! I was just going to...

176
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:16,161
Giving special care
to specific students...

177
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,735
it's forbidden in this college.

178
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:20,131
Teacher Akira.

179
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:26,839
That's you, Akira!

180
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:29,578
I've got to ask you something important.

181
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:33,474
Can I take Mao back, Hitomi?

182
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,914
It's up to you.

183
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:37,921
Hitomi.

184
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:43,292
It's you.

185
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,788
Long time no see, Uncle.

186
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,431
Get away from me.

187
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:52,661
Don't be so afraid, I won't hurt you.

188
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:55,931
But just right.

189
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,201
Uncle, you're still clear-headed.

190
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:02,546
I know absolutely nothing.

191
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:08,286
Really? Are you telling me the truth?

192
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:11,152
It's just because of you doing that...

193
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,782
Iosing yourself in the lust of flesh...

194
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:17,521
- and violating my mother.
- I did love Rikako very much!

195
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:20,024
I did love her.

196
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:23,858
Believe me, I've had no idea that
things would turn out this way.

197
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,962
I didn't expect any of this, honestly.

198
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:30,668
All I thought was...

199
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:34,505
You possess an odor like Rikako.

200
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,908
- Smells good.
- Don't touch me!

201
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:41,011
It's all your fault.

202
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:44,352
You made my mother die Uncle.

203
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:49,827
It's Himiko who killed her.
It was not my fault!

204
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,322
I'm in a lot of pain,
you've got to believe me!

205
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:57,061
I don't exactly recall what happened.

206
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:58,603
But, I know...

207
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,967
Now, come on, tell me!

208
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,679
Why did Auntie Himiko choose
Hitomi as the last Sheath?

209
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:19,547
Twins? Me and Hitomi?

210
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,119
Akira, tell me it's not true.

211
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:25,362
I don't know what Kaori
is thinking about.

212
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:30,031
I can't leave you suffering.
It's my duty to take care of you.

213
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:36,130
If you want I can
become an enemy of Kaori.

214
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:40,138
Don't say that!

215
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,538
I don't want to hear it anymore!

216
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:44,939
Why! Why!

217
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:47,417
Why does everyone hate each other?

218
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:50,916
Mao.

219
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:00,755
What do you mean?

220
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:04,235
Mao wasn't the daughter of Uncle?

221
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,464
But weren't Mao and Hitomi born together?

222
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:11,399
So, Mao actually is...

223
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:16,311
So that's what it is.

224
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:20,950
Can't believe it. I was a fool.

225
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:25,889
Tetsumask!

226
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:33,258
Possessing Fujio, it can't be!

227
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,692
You.

228
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,129
That's him who did something
that shouldn't be done.

229
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:45,434
I wouldn't have let him stay
alive if he was of no use.

230
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:47,809
Auntie Himiko.

231
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:50,677
I guess it's still within office hours now.

232
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:53,882
Sneaking into someone's house...

233
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:57,080
It must be my sister
didn't teach you very well.

234
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:16,331
I am going to give you a good
lesson on behalf of my sister.

235
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:19,304
What the hell is this?

236
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:24,509
How come it doesn't work?

237
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:29,777
I've just withhold your spell
from my Kongouketu.

238
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,579
Bodai.

239
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:34,792
That precious little kiddie.

240
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:38,856
I've just converted him
to be at my command.

241
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:39,861
No!

242
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:49,901
What the hell are they doing?
Both just pushing the college aside.

243
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,469
However it may look to other people...

244
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:58,209
I think it's good to let Kaori
suffer the torment by herself.

245
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,908
It hurts! Stop it!

246
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:05,479
How can you treat us like this?

247
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,884
My goodness! Kaori.

248
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:11,324
What happened to you?
Aren't you always so tough?

249
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,295
Help!

250
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:16,458
Wake up!

251
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:22,900
How terrible it is.

252
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:29,379
You can't even cast a spell.

253
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:37,113
I'm never going to forgive you!

254
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:49,234
It's not been that long ago,
but you've gotten mature.

255
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:52,198
No, don't!

256
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:55,134
I heard Kaori is fond of masturbation.

257
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:57,639
Let's see how wanton
she can be right here.

258
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:00,210
Let me take a close look.

259
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:04,048
Auntie, please don't look, please!

260
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:27,965
It's so watery!
Kaori gets excited so easily.

261
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,138
It's just the same as sister Rikako.

262
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,002
Mom! How come Auntie!

263
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,681
No, don't get inside!

264
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:45,223
It's got inside!

265
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:48,925
No!

266
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:51,095
Don't look, Auntie, no!

267
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,731
What am I going to do?

268
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:06,669
Feels so good! It got inside!

269
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:14,775
It seems like you get more excited
when someone's looking at you.

270
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:17,749
Well, just let me take a good look.

271
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,667
In this way.

272
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,768
How embarrassing.

273
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:38,467
Feels so good.

274
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:46,243
So good. Feels so good.

275
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:51,287
Look, just look.

276
00:21:58,364 --> 00:22:01,856
Look how raunchy I am!

277
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:04,425
I can't stand it.

278
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:06,397
No!

279
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:11,940
I can't stand it anymore!
I'm coming!

280
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:15,370
I'm coming!

281
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,754
How wonderful, Kaori.

282
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:34,827
In this case
you can compete with Rikako.

283
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:40,665
But before that...

284
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:45,207
No! Don't!

285
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:47,945
Got to be careful with you.

286
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:59,180
Can't move my legs!

287
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:02,026
How dirty!

288
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:08,256
Is this how the master
of the Ootori family supposed to be?

289
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:15,429
Rikako! Rikako!

290
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:19,809
- No, don't!
- Rikako!

291
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:25,681
No, don't get inside! Auntie Himiko!

292
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:29,248
Stop him!

293
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:32,222
No!

294
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,785
Help me!

295
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:39,787
Often, a serious person
could become terribly wanton.

296
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:44,358
Mao would go and save her definitely.

297
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:51,099
That way I can go and eat her, right?

298
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:53,478
Sister.

299
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:59,107
Kaori wasn't at college.

300
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:00,216
Yeah?

301
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:07,349
She's never been so late before,
without making any contact.

302
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,654
She doesn't need
to be worried about, right?

303
00:24:11,797 --> 00:24:13,094
That's true.

304
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:17,031
Mao! What are you doing in here!

305
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:19,464
Teacher Merani!

306
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:22,631
Somebody like Kaori...

307
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:25,076
could also take a tumble.

308
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:26,871
What happened to my sister?

309
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:29,914
She's in the dungeon of the Kameyamas.

310
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:30,538
What?

311
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:34,174
However, it's for your own good.
Maybe this way is better.

312
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,114
Right, teacher Akira?

313
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:40,581
What are you talking about,
I've got to save my sister!

314
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:42,293
I knew you'd say so.

315
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:43,825
Akira!

316
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:46,827
Let's go! We've got to get her out!

317
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:52,862
Please stop it!

318
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:54,834
Please let me go!

319
00:25:10,022 --> 00:25:13,219
How does that feel?
It feels good.
