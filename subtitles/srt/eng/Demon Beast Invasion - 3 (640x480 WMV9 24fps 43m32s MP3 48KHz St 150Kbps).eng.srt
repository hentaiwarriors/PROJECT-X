00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Demon Beast Invasion
episode 3

2
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,470
It's ghostly aura calls to
the evil spirits around here.

3
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,920
These past visions
are disgusting to see.

4
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,510
Impossible!

5
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,640
Begone, dead creatures!

6
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,240
This is where
they failed to kill it.

7
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,450
But how could they
with Maitreya's power?

8
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,920
They were just a normal man and
woman. They weren't like us.

9
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,170
Mother! Now you and
I will become one!

10
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,260
And infinite power
will be mine!

11
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,890
I didn't give birth to you!

12
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,600
Your power is the source
of my power, Mother.

13
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,480
You forced yourself into me!

14
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,400
Don't make up things!

15
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,110
Then why do you drip
with this warm wetness?

16
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,200
You know you want to
become one with me!

17
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,210
Stop it!

18
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,250
Kayo!

19
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,240
Why... Why can't I move?

20
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,260
Okay?

21
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,480
Muneto!

22
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,450
Kayo!

23
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,290
Mother! Why?
Why?! Why?!

24
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,050
WHY?!!!

25
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,990
Her mind's synched all
the way with the vision!

26
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,370
I'm okay. Just a little tired.

27
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,840
It's a Demon Beast reading,
all right.

28
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,680
Its body was dying.
It must have made it here...

29
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,640
Its consciousness is still active
in part of its body.

30
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,350
If we're to settle this,
we have to finish it off.

31
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,000
Mother! Don't abandon me!

32
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,210
Not that voice again!

33
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,090
I thought it was over.
I thought it was over!

34
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,550
I don't want
to remember again!

35
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,930
I have to forget!
I have to forget...

36
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,570
The Demon Beast hasn't contacted
Kayo yet. Standing guard.

37
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,260
Help me!

38
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,610
Demon Beast spawn section
apportioned!

39
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,660
It was one of the
mother body's classmates.

40
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,370
Pursuing fertilizing carrier body.

41
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,840
Come on, Kayo.
Why don't you come over?

42
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,680
My father's gone to Oyama for
a memorial service for Maitreya.

43
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,430
From now on... Oh,
it won't work, Muneto.

44
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,690
At least hearing your voice
makes me feel better.

45
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,100
No... Ever since we did it...

46
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,480
When I hear your voice,
I can't control myself!.

47
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,530
I can't go to my parents
this late at night.

48
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,530
Please, help me forget all
these awful memories.

49
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,750
If you don't,
I don't know what I'll do!

50
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,540
Kayo... Just remember
how it felt for the two of us to...

51
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,800
...be wrapped
in Maitreya's power.

52
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,010
I felt... your warmth
inside of me... Like this!

53
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,800
Yes, as you flowed
with your own warmth.

54
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,890
As I thrust into you...

55
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,140
Oh, Kayo! I want to suck
your breasts again!

56
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,810
Your finger...

57
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,810
I love you! Oh, god,
I'm burning up for you.

58
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,360
Kayo, make that sound again!
I can't take it anymore!

59
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,150
Don't say that!
It's embarrassing!

60
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,160
Kayo, please!

61
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,870
Muneto, I feel like...
I'm going to...!

62
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,220
My body's doing this by itself.
Don't hate me...

63
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,590
I'm not usually this sex crazed!

64
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,940
Him again!

65
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,280
Kayo!

66
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,130
One of my sisters is with her.
She still hasn't been attacked.

67
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,130
Her body is calling forth
those visions, though.

68
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,470
Who are you?!

69
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,220
Interplanetary Mutual
Observation Agent: Ash.

70
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,140
I've been dispatched here
to follow up...

71
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,810
...on your failure to
finish off the Demon Beast.

72
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,730
What did you say?!

73
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
The Demon Beast is
trying to revive itself.

74
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,200
Then it isn't over.

75
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,200
It's all because I couldn't protect
Kayo from it in the first place..

76
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,910
...that she's the way she is.

77
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,620
And now it's back...

78
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,190
Kayo stole your heart while
you were on this assignment.

79
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,990
So you couldn't fulfill
your duty as an I MO agent.

80
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,740
I'm just a student now.

81
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,670
I can't let you be one.

82
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,980
You'll be late.

83
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,070
Muneto...

84
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,730
You should just forget
all that horrible stuff.

85
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,570
But, when I heard
they'd closed the school...

86
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,660
It wasn't your fault.
Don't worry about it.

87
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,570
I know,
but then I think about...

88
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,410
...all the classmates who were
sacrificed to that Demon Beast.

89
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,870
I'm here with you.

90
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,880
Sorry about last night.
But why'd you hang up like that?

91
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,420
Well...
Dad came home, so...

92
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,010
The Demon Beast is
trying to revive itself.

93
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,180
I can't lay this on Kayo.

94
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,600
We'd better hurry.

95
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,450
Mother... Mother!

96
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:15,760
Her scent... I want the warmth
I smell flowing from her!

97
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:32,770
After what happened, our class
transferred away bit by bit.

98
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,110
But besides that,
what happened to me last night?

99
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,150
I can't even tell Muneto about it.

100
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,140
Again? No, not now!

101
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,110
Kayo's stolen your heart.
Your mission isn't over yet.

102
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,400
I'm just a student now.

103
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,860
I can't let you be one.

104
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,160
Mother, you are my life.

105
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,540
You are the only one who
I can become one with in this world.

106
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,880
Only being with you
can I be happy!

107
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,570
My class! I'm going to
be late for my class!

108
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,080
Why is this happening?!

109
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,250
- Oh, yes...
- No, you're not like Mother!

110
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,210
More power!

111
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,710
Not like her...
You're not! You're not!

112
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,630
More power!

113
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,220
Kayo!

114
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,590
I have to save Kayo...

115
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,440
I must gather together
my body's parts!

116
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,320
Bring Mother to me!

117
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,950
Help me!

118
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,320
Sis has changed
since we got here.

119
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,000
"Be a little more showy.
Worry about the Earthier."

120
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,540
She's never said
anything like that.

121
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,250
She made us set
the Buster Guns to 50%.

122
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,040
I wonder if she's all right?

123
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,310
Why, you...!

124
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,190
Even a little part of the Demon
Beast has that much life force?

125
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,730
Sis!

126
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,960
Strange... Ms. Satomi's never
been late or missed her class.

127
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,010
I wonder if she's sick.

128
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,350
Kayo, do you want to come down
to Shinjuku with us later?

129
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,430
Huh?

130
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,560
We're going to a burger
place in Shintoshi.

131
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,940
Class 1-3 from Meisei's
all split up, right?

132
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,360
Well, the girls from the
class are getting together.

133
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Kayo... Maybe we should
play it safe today.

134
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,730
Oh, Muneto.

135
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,450
We're all just worried about
how depressed Kayo's gotten.

136
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,370
She's right.
I don't want to be rude.

137
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,990
I promised them that
I'll bring you.

138
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,540
We are the only women to come here
from the other school.

139
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,840
We even asked Ms. Satomi to come
since she transferred here, too.

140
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,050
You did?

141
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,340
She's been so nice,
trying to comfort us since then.

142
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,390
If we can all just relax
and have a good time...

143
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,760
Then it's decided!
The more, the merrier!

144
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,480
Don't you think
it sounds fun, Muneto?

145
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,730
Yeah...

146
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,480
But what can be keeping
Ms. Satomi?

147
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,990
Ms. Satomi...
Could she have been...?!

148
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,760
That's strange. Everyone
should have been here by now.

149
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,760
Don't worry.
I know they'll come.

150
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,230
Stop it!

151
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:41,910
Kayo lied to us!
She said this thing was dead!

152
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,540
Ms. Satomi, why just us?!

153
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,880
Our class... must be cursed...

154
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,260
Mother!

155
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,680
Where is she?

156
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,280
Where is she?!

157
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,940
Don't kill the girls.

158
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,310
Gotcha!

159
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,280
Erase!

160
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,870
Help me!

161
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,290
Where's it gone?!

162
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,370
Kayo! It must have smelled
the mother's body!

163
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,380
Besides that, its body...

164
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,880
The Demon Beast is exploding
with growth hormones.

165
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,340
If it doesn't combine
with Kayo properly...

166
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,010
...it'll just keep on growing
bigger and bigger!

167
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,640
We have to get it now!

168
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,560
We can't let it get to her!

169
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,640
Hey, what's that?

170
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,350
What's going on?

171
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,560
Who are they?

172
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,370
Ms. Satomi!

173
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,380
Wake up! Speak to me!

174
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,040
How could this...?

175
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
Save yourself, Kayo...

176
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,930
The Demon Beast's about
to regenerate itself.

177
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,520
Who are...?

178
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,440
He needs women to regenerate.
And he's after you!

179
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,240
What...?!

180
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,410
It's coming!

181
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,770
I was once able to gain
Maitreya's powers...

182
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,100
...and defeat the Demon Beast.

183
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:41,070
But now it's after Kayo and
the whole human world.

184
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,440
Love is power. The power
to drive evil away.

185
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,820
Maitreya taught us that.

186
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,620
But can I save Kayo,
the way I am now?

187
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,790
Do I have the right?

188
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,790
I don't know!

189
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,460
Believe in yourself!.

190
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,090
Yours and Kayo's heart
became one, that time.

191
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,180
There was love.
I know this.

192
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,010
How could you?

193
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,100
I am a woman born
only to fight.

194
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,810
Love, friendship,
feelings of kinship...

195
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,440
All outside of duty
has been forgotten.

196
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,770
Or maybe I never knew them at all.

197
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:26,110
But it was you two who
returned these feelings to me.

198
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,700
The image of you two
joined in love.

199
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,330
That's how!
How I know of your feelings.

200
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,130
How I know of the
potential power within you.

201
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,800
With your feelings
as torn apart as they are...

202
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,840
...you won't be able to stop
the Demon Beast or save Kayo!

203
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,720
Believe in yourself!.

204
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,270
Try to feel the love
you have for Kayo!

205
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,520
I can't do it now.

206
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,520
Help me, Kayo!

207
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,540
Help me!

208
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,800
You...!

209
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,220
Can't you do something?

210
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,840
Can't you contact Ash, Dee?

211
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:36,100
I lost my visor!
I can't contact her without it!

212
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,940
We could manage
if we had the Buster Gun!

213
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,070
Let's try it!

214
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,570
Damn!

215
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,580
Sis!

216
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,600
What the hell's
going on here?

217
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:23,980
Kayo... Kayo...

218
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,980
Sorry!
I didn't mean to peep.

219
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,270
Since I can't get your help...

220
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,200
...we'll have to do everything
we can to stop the Demon Beast.

221
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,660
When I face a life
or death battle...

222
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,200
...I like to purify my body
with water. Just a habit.

223
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,290
I'm sorry.
I can't believe in myself.

224
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,670
Can I really bring
my love for her out?

225
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,300
The way we felt
when we joined that time...

226
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,710
It feels like
it never happened.

227
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,970
I don't even feel
Maitreya's power...

228
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:42,390
You're wrong. Maitreya's power
is sleeping within your heart.

229
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,060
That power comes when your heart
calls out to love and protect each other.

230
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,520
That is Maitreya's power!

231
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,570
Without your consciousness,
Kayo cannot save herself.

232
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,570
I'll help you to remember.

233
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,370
Run for it!

234
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,290
Train now arriving in station.
Please stand behind the white line.

235
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,020
The damn thing doesn't know
when to quit!

236
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,690
Why are you helping me?

237
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,070
This is my job.

238
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,400
All we can do is dodge him
till Sis gets here with Muneto.

239
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,700
We three can't handle
this Demon Beast alone.

240
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,120
We need your power!

241
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,120
Muneto...

242
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,790
Stop it! Stop!
This is your duty?!

243
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,720
Pretend I'm Kayo!

244
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:05,100
If I'm to synch my clairvoyance
to give you the feeling...

245
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:10,190
...you two had in my vision,
you have to think I'm Kayo!

246
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,770
Kayo... Forgive me!

247
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,080
Open your feelings.
Think back to that time.

248
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,500
Remember...

249
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,310
Kayo...

250
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,880
Muneto!

251
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,200
At that moment,
when I learned of your love...

252
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,910
...I learned another way
a woman can live her life.

253
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,750
To see something
beyond death and battle.

254
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:43,260
I'm a poor substitute for the love
you and Kayo have tuned so finely!

255
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,840
It feels so strange.

256
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,090
Is this power I feel in
the depths of my heart...

257
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,180
...the power of Maitreya?

258
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:54,230
It could almost pierce Kayo
with the love I have for her!

259
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,940
My body, it's getting hot!

260
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,290
I wonder if
BB and Kayo are okay.

261
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,980
It's that big?!
I better find Sis!

262
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,330
We'll have to hide here
till Ash and Muneto come.

263
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,010
We're late!
And I can't contact my two sisters!

264
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,550
Is Kayo okay?

265
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,180
Look at the Demon Beast.

266
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,890
It's just a giant lump
of growing flesh now.

267
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,310
Kayo's still okay. We just
have to find her before it can!

268
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,820
It found us!

269
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,070
Found her! Found her!
Found her! Found her!

270
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,410
Help me, Muneto!

271
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,740
Kayo!

272
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,380
I'll bring you with me,
Mother!

273
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,400
Mother! At last...
At last we can become one!

274
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:08,530
This is getting worse. It's
regenerating just by touching her.

275
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,030
If he gets her completely,
we'll never get her back!

276
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,620
What do we do?

277
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,490
First I have to get
Kayo away from it.

278
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:21,750
Then you and she have to use
Maitreya's power to finish it off.

279
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,080
Gotcha! Go to it!

280
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,420
Mother, I have waited so long
for this day...

281
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,760
MOTHER!!!

282
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,090
No! I don't want to!
Not with you! Let me go!

283
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,440
No, I won't let you!

284
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,370
No use. Can't break
through by myself.

285
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,620
Sis!

286
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
BB! Dee!

287
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,800
We're about to enter
our final mission.

288
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,720
Final mission?

289
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,180
Later, pal.

290
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,980
Good bye.

291
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,980
Farewell, Muneto.

292
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,780
We'll have to use the
last of our power to free Kayo.

293
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,700
Thank you. Because of you, I was
able to come as a real woman.

294
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,040
I only wish I could have
shared that with my sisters.

295
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,170
Ash! What are...
What are you going to do?

296
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,880
That's the first time you've
called me by my name, Muneto...

297
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,220
No! Ash! Don't go!

298
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,880
Take care of Kayo...

299
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,680
YOU CAN'T DIE!!!

300
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,860
It is useless.
Mother belongs to me!

301
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,250
Impossible!

302
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,590
Kayo!

303
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,890
Kayo...

304
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,560
Muneto, I...

305
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,100
I know.
Now lend me your power.

306
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,610
I was just about to regenerate...

307
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,950
Mother! Mother!

308
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,910
Why?! Mother!

309
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:30,600
So many victims
because I lacked the strength...

310
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,860
Ash...

311
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,280
It's all right.

312
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,320
Yeah. Thank you.

313
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,660
I couldn't do anything.
Anything at all...

314
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,750
Let's go home.

315
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:23,620
Mother... Mother...
Mother... Mother...

316
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,330
Just a dream. Thank god.

317
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,850
Thank god. Just a dream.

318
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,980
Mother, I am immortal.

319
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,700
I will keep comihg back to life

Please! Please!
