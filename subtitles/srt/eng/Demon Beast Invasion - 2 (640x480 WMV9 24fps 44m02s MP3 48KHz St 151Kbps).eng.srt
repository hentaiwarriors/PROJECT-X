1
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:24,005
Demon Beasts, coming to Earth
from Quasar PHL-5200...

2
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,837
...invade human bodies in
their quest to bring forth...

3
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,180
...an Earth-adapted version of
themselves to aid their invasion.

4
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:33,244
They search for a human
to act as a host for them.

5
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,407
Yet another
unsuitable woman...

6
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:04,514
Seeking to stop them are
Interplanetary Mutual Observation...

7
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:07,987
...agents Shinichi Kasu
and Muneto Ungyosai.

8
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:13,657
After taking posession of Muneto's
childhood friend Tsutomu Kawai...

9
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:16,691
...the Demon Beast attempts to make
another friend, Kayo Asakura...

10
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:18,960
...their latest
impregnation subject.

11
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:57,812
Muneto...
It's up to you now.

12
00:04:58,286 --> 00:05:02,746
However, thanks to Kasu's sacrifice
and Muneto's decisive action...

13
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:07,557
...the Demon Beast was killed,
his plans foiled.

14
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:30,314
But the invasion didn't end there.

15
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:19,284
Kayo! Where are you
going for summer vacation?

16
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:20,925
Haven't decided.

17
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:24,761
Bet you and Muneto
are going to a resort!

18
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,234
We... We're not like that...

19
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:31,739
Oh man! Guess the hormones
haven't kicked in yet.

20
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:33,273
Well excuse me!

21
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:36,276
Actually, I'm sorta glad.
I haven't decided either.

22
00:07:36,678 --> 00:07:38,373
We can go someplace together!

23
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:40,437
Just us ladies? I dunno...

24
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:43,583
Well, try to think of
someplace for us to go.

25
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:46,017
Sure. I'll find someplace
where we can party till we drop.

26
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:47,679
Maybe not that much.

27
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:50,121
I hear you.
I'll call you later, okay?

28
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:51,818
Sure. Bye!

29
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:06,840
Oh shit... Don't tell me.
A pervert?

30
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:14,376
God, if it's not
one thing it's ano...

31
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:38,269
Man, college uniforms
are such a turn on...

32
00:08:38,906 --> 00:08:42,603
Say, summer can be
awfully hot, can't it?

33
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,543
Why don't I
just take these off?

34
00:08:46,247 --> 00:08:47,737
Can't have you
overheating, right?

35
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:52,378
There we go.
Mmm, love that smell!

36
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:56,950
Oh, yes... Young ladies
are always the best.

37
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:02,688
Hold on, I've got a
big surprise for you.

38
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,133
Hi there.

39
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:09,599
No!

40
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,194
Come on, let me do it.

41
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:13,901
Stop it!

42
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:17,440
I'll be done in a sec.

43
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:19,409
Just hang on.

44
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:51,101
A monster!

45
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:29,308
That...

46
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:35,851
Was it just a nightmare?

47
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:18,659
Get out! Get out!

48
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:23,327
I know you're there,
inside of me.

49
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,598
Please, just get out!

50
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:28,064
Get out!

51
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:32,011
Asakura residence.

52
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,241
Kayo, it's me, Muneto.

53
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:43,485
Are you free today?

54
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:45,685
Can we go hang out someplace?

55
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:48,561
Kayo?

56
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:50,859
I'm sorry, I'm really
not in the mood.

57
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:54,163
It's nice out today. You'll feel
better once you're outside.

58
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,635
You're always like this.

59
00:11:56,938 --> 00:11:59,930
Always putting your feelings
ahead of anyone else's!

60
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,070
Hold on, I never...

61
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:04,975
Just like you always were!

62
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:08,482
You want to do something and don't
care what anyone else wants!

63
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:11,450
And now... Now...
I hate you!

64
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:13,410
Kayo, what's wrong?

65
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:36,172
What did I do?

66
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:40,142
What do you
want from me, Kayo?

67
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:41,272
Kayo!

68
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,908
What do you want from me?!

69
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:51,855
I don't want to talk to you!

70
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:53,154
What's with you?

71
00:12:53,594 --> 00:12:54,526
Miki...

72
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:57,120
What's up? Something wrong?

73
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:00,793
I'm in the neighborhood.
Can I come and visit?

74
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:01,835
Sure...

75
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:29,422
Something happen
between you and Muneto?

76
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:31,897
I mean, you can talk
about it if you want.

77
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,131
I...

78
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,168
What is it?

79
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:38,899
I just don't know what to do!

80
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,898
Kayo...

81
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:45,103
Cheer up!
Come on, what's wrong?

82
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:48,245
Miki!

83
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,492
Kayo, what is it?

84
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:02,188
Stay away from me!

85
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:05,525
Kayo!

86
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,211
I'll get an ambulance!

87
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:31,550
Wha...?!
What is this thing?!

88
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:35,893
I don't know! I don't know!

89
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:39,864
Kayo, stop it!

90
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:42,960
It isn't me! It isn't!

91
00:14:50,177 --> 00:14:51,576
No!

92
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:12,524
No, please!
I'm still a virgin!

93
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:48,632
Hold it, Demon!

94
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:59,307
Who are you?!

95
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,741
The man who's going to kill you.

96
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:04,512
We thought that woman was
just the lucky survivor...

97
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:06,177
...of a Demon Beast impregnation.

98
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:11,247
Who would believe she'd
give birth to one of you!

99
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:13,850
I'll kill you before
you're born all the way!

100
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:17,194
Wait! You'll kill
the woman if you do!

101
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:20,866
Small price to pay
for saving the Earth!

102
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:23,334
Don't!

103
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,379
You little...
You won't get away!

104
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:08,909
I hate you! Hate you!

105
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:14,249
Damn it! I was just trying
to protect her... Tsutomu...!

106
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:17,585
May I sit here?

107
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:19,487
Sure, go ahead.

108
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,155
So, what can be the matter?
Feeling lonely tonight?

109
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:24,429
Not really.

110
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:29,231
That's all well for you,
but I am feeling lonely.

111
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:46,447
Kayo...

112
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:17,050
Trying to make up
for getting dumped?

113
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:19,017
Who...

114
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:20,383
Who are you?!

115
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:22,684
I'm here to tell you we've
got a big problem on our hands.

116
00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:26,317
Big problem?
Who the fuck are you?!

117
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:32,526
Junichi Yagami,
your new partner.

118
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:36,027
You're an agent?
What are you doing here?

119
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:39,334
Kayo Asakura. She's given
birth to a Demon Beast.

120
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,172
She's what?!

121
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:47,613
I am reborn!

122
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:52,311
Reborn to rule this world!

123
00:18:54,121 --> 00:19:00,754
They come...
Soon they will come!

124
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:23,016
They'll be here soon.

125
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:27,452
The atmosphere's composition will
begin to change in a matter of hours.

126
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:33,359
Then their invasion
starts in earnest.

127
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:36,021
At this rate, it's just a matter
of time before the air...

128
00:19:36,096 --> 00:19:38,564
...is completely reformed
for them to breathe.

129
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,061
Hey, where are you going?!

130
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:44,126
It's still just a baby.
You can handle it yourself.

131
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:45,933
You'd just abandon your duty?

132
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:49,066
If you've been bugging Kayo's
apartment, then you know.

133
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:50,837
I'm not the man for the job.

134
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:54,777
I let my friend die,
my partner Kasu die...

135
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:56,315
And now Kayo...

136
00:19:56,383 --> 00:20:00,251
Oh please! You'd give up
all because of some woman?!

137
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:03,420
Fuck off!

138
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,123
Christ, what a waste!
What does HQ see in that wimp?

139
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:24,874
OH! Oh, Chief!

140
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:31,983
You like it, Yoshiko?
Good enough for you?

141
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,349
Oh, yes!

142
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,445
There we go!

143
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:43,830
There, there...
Party time tonight, huh?

144
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:46,559
In, out. In, out.

145
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:58,734
Yes! Yes!

146
00:21:03,817 --> 00:21:06,513
Just a little more!
Don't stop!

147
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,543
Your wish is my command,
my sweet.

148
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:51,562
The main fleet will be here soon.
Then no one can stop us.

149
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:57,900
But before that...
I will avenge my father!

150
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:00,870
Muneto Ungyosai!

151
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:06,169
I'll kill you
with my own hands!

152
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:16,986
See you later, then.

153
00:22:17,057 --> 00:22:19,184
Yeah... Later.

154
00:22:21,228 --> 00:22:22,525
Kayo!

155
00:22:23,363 --> 00:22:25,456
All that stuff... It didn't
really happen, did it?

156
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:28,467
I'm still a virgin, right?

157
00:22:28,535 --> 00:22:29,627
What are you talking about?

158
00:22:29,703 --> 00:22:32,501
It was a hallucination or
something! It couldn't happen.

159
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:33,798
Yeah, sure...

160
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,398
Yeah, right!

161
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:36,635
Goodnight...

162
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,107
Goodnight.

163
00:22:38,178 --> 00:22:39,543
Miki...

164
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,545
It wasn't a dream.

165
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:52,049
Miki, you've been...

166
00:22:55,862 --> 00:22:59,889
Tsutomu, tell me.
What should I do?

167
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:06,705
Muneto?!

168
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:09,173
I'm terrible!

169
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:19,178
She's right. I should
just forget all about it.

170
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,217
Ah, but they say you
never forget your first time.

171
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,759
It didn't happen!
It didn't!

172
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:30,194
You remember.
At least your body does.

173
00:23:32,232 --> 00:23:34,462
It's a dream...
Just a bad dream!

174
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:38,866
That's right, a dream.
A lovely wet dream!

175
00:23:47,147 --> 00:23:52,210
Well, doesn't it feel nice?
Nothing to be ashamed of.

176
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,418
Come on, admit how
you really feel.

177
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:03,827
You like it, don't you?

178
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:12,336
Gotta speak up. Had enough?
Does it feel good?

179
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:16,169
Which do you think?
Shall I stop?

180
00:24:22,182 --> 00:24:23,843
Don't... please...

181
00:24:25,118 --> 00:24:28,349
Don't stop, please!

182
00:24:29,523 --> 00:24:34,290
Good woman. Well said.
Now here's your reward!

183
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,139
Shit! Too late!

184
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:57,372
The Demon's making his move.
God damn that Muneto!

185
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,312
The hell...?

186
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:11,890
I take it you're not
here to ask me for a date.

187
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:31,843
Of course! They're under
that monster's control!

188
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:51,203
Who can that be at this hour?

189
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:57,577
I'm sorry, Kayo.
I'm still so scared.

190
00:25:57,577 --> 00:26:00,045
Can I spend
the night with you?

191
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,471
What are we going
to do with you?

192
00:26:05,986 --> 00:26:07,146
I bet you're hungry.

193
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:11,613
Yeah, I ran all the way over
here. Starving, actually.

194
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:14,285
Why don't we go somewhere
tomorrow and relax?

195
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:16,228
Sure.

196
00:26:27,474 --> 00:26:29,339
Miki, want some soup?

197
00:26:29,976 --> 00:26:31,307
What are you doing?

198
00:26:31,378 --> 00:26:32,402
Well...

199
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:37,407
Miki, you're...?!

200
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:42,149
I know what's really
going on, Kayo.

201
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:43,256
Miki!

202
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,158
MIKI!

203
00:26:47,694 --> 00:26:50,629
Kayo!
It's all your fault!

204
00:26:56,069 --> 00:26:58,537
Mother! It's been
only half a day...

205
00:26:58,605 --> 00:27:01,438
...but it feels like
ages since I've seen you!

206
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:03,272
You're...!

207
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,774
Look Ma, all grown up!

208
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:12,107
We'll meet again,
after our invasion begins!

209
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:17,450
But first I'll kill
that god damned Muneto!

210
00:27:17,757 --> 00:27:18,951
Muneto?!

211
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:33,737
Muneto, please...
Please pick up!

212
00:27:34,508 --> 00:27:35,770
Tsutomu's dead.

213
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:38,970
Please, I don't
want you to die too!

214
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:48,818
Shit!

215
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,157
The hell with the Demons!
It's not my problem!

216
00:27:57,497 --> 00:27:59,556
Let 'em have the goddamn Earth!

217
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:03,259
Just stay away from me!

218
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:05,762
Shit!

219
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:15,506
Muneto, please be all right.

220
00:28:15,582 --> 00:28:18,380
I don't want
to lose you, too!

221
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,793
Muneto!
Die with your temple!

222
00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:48,541
Is that bastard still
creeping around here?!

223
00:28:49,883 --> 00:28:52,681
Just lemme alone!
I don't care!

224
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:54,281
Hey!

225
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:56,379
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

226
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:57,753
Sorry...

227
00:28:57,824 --> 00:29:00,918
It's my friend's car.
We just had a fight.

228
00:29:01,428 --> 00:29:04,022
You know the guy
who owns this car?!

229
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:05,029
Well...

230
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:07,931
Do you know
he's been murdered?!

231
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:09,261
What?!

232
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:13,637
He was attacked here
a few hours ago.

233
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,073
Looks like whoever did it
used something pretty nasty.

234
00:29:17,143 --> 00:29:19,941
He was dead by the
time the meat wagon came.

235
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:21,982
We don't have a suspect,
but we think he was attacked...

236
00:29:21,982 --> 00:29:23,916
...by more than one person.
- Him!

237
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:27,886
Fire at the Ungyo Temple!
Fire at the Ungyo Temple!

238
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:29,753
The temple?!

239
00:29:29,923 --> 00:29:32,659
All available units,
please assist!

240
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:34,650
It's gonna be one
of those nights...

241
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:38,120
Hey! Hold it!

242
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,125
HEY!

243
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:42,162
God dammit!

244
00:29:50,076 --> 00:29:52,408
He got Yagami and
now he's after me!

245
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:55,471
I just want them
to leave me alone!

246
00:29:55,982 --> 00:29:58,746
I... I...

247
00:29:58,818 --> 00:30:01,184
What the hell am I doing?

248
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:03,588
Am I trying to
go and kill him?

249
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:07,089
Just stay away!

250
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:21,430
Yeah, I'll stay away.
I couldn't do anything before...

251
00:30:24,744 --> 00:30:27,440
- It's up to you.
- KASU!!!

252
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:34,242
Muneto...
Take care of Kayo...

253
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,446
Tsutomu!

254
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:51,661
Tsutomu... Kasu...
They're... They're...

255
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:53,603
They're counting on me!

256
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:04,316
What a mess.

257
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,810
They lost a lot
of people in there.

258
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:10,420
Muneto...

259
00:31:14,761 --> 00:31:16,251
Muneto...

260
00:31:25,171 --> 00:31:29,767
Mother!
Muneto Ungyosai is dead!?

261
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:35,039
Now no one stands in our way!

262
00:31:35,115 --> 00:31:37,777
The invasion of Earth can
begin as we wish it to!

263
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:42,820
This is a night to remember!

264
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:45,786
The party's in full swing!

265
00:31:47,794 --> 00:31:52,390
Mother, you're invited too!
The Earth will be ours tonight!

266
00:31:52,565 --> 00:31:54,624
Why don't you celebrate with me?

267
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,741
Junichi Yagami...

268
00:32:09,816 --> 00:32:12,751
Awaken, Junichi Yagami!

269
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,517
You are still needed
to do your duty.

270
00:32:19,058 --> 00:32:23,085
Damn, and I could practically
see the pearly gates!

271
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:29,361
That monster... He's at the
Meisei campus! All right then!

272
00:32:56,696 --> 00:32:58,061
So you came
after all, Mother.

273
00:32:58,231 --> 00:33:00,967
Join the fun!
It's our night, after all.

274
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:05,233
Sad about Muneto's death?
Don't worry!

275
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,567
I'll help you to forget.
Just like these women!

276
00:33:15,248 --> 00:33:17,182
Having a party up here?

277
00:33:17,851 --> 00:33:20,911
I'll break it up before
the PTA finds out!

278
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:24,551
So, you didn't die after all.

279
00:33:25,658 --> 00:33:27,523
Well, I did, but...

280
00:33:28,695 --> 00:33:30,560
Then prepare to die again!

281
00:33:36,502 --> 00:33:38,527
When you dial
the energy down...

282
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:40,470
...even a Buster Gun
can be a stun gun!

283
00:33:41,107 --> 00:33:42,506
Why, you...

284
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:46,705
But for you, the treatment
won't be quite as gentle!

285
00:33:48,314 --> 00:33:49,838
What the...?!

286
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,282
- Miki!
- She's still here?!

287
00:34:01,928 --> 00:34:04,954
Sentimental fool!
DIE!!!

288
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,530
What?

289
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,466
I'm through letting you
do what you want, Demon!

290
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:14,631
Prepare to die!

291
00:34:14,707 --> 00:34:17,335
You?!
You're still alive?!

292
00:34:17,677 --> 00:34:18,939
Muneto!

293
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,281
You jerk!
I was so worried!

294
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,847
Sorry.

295
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,611
Christ, you think you can save
the true love bit for later?!

296
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:33,948
Muneto and Yagami...
You both shall die!

297
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,394
You okay to fight
with that arm?

298
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:38,862
Just a flesh wound!
Let's go!

299
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:54,637
Shit!

300
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,141
Yagami!

301
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:00,978
Muneto!

302
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:13,562
Yagami, speak to me!

303
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:18,299
Listen Muneto...
That thing's their monitor drone.

304
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:22,832
The Quasarians are using
him to check out the Earth.

305
00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:28,011
If they think the invasion won't
work, they'll call it all off.

306
00:35:28,181 --> 00:35:32,140
So if I kill him,
they'll leave the Earth alone?

307
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:34,846
Dunno... Maybe...

308
00:35:35,254 --> 00:35:36,482
Muneto! Behind you!

309
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:47,999
She was taken
over by the Demon.

310
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:50,126
I know you'll hate
me for it, Kayo...

311
00:35:50,203 --> 00:35:53,536
...but there was no
other way to save her.

312
00:35:53,873 --> 00:35:54,965
Yagami!

313
00:35:55,041 --> 00:36:01,105
Muneto, protect them...
The Earth... and Kayo.

314
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,807
Yagami!
Yagami, forgive me.

315
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,286
Muneto!

316
00:36:16,562 --> 00:36:18,655
Father is avenged!

317
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:23,002
Muneto, speak to me.

318
00:36:23,202 --> 00:36:27,764
Kayo... Forgive me...
All my fault...

319
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:32,941
Don't die!
Don't leave me all alone!

320
00:36:33,746 --> 00:36:35,771
MUNETO!!!

321
00:36:45,858 --> 00:36:49,294
Stand aside, Mother.
Let me finish him!

322
00:36:49,362 --> 00:36:50,226
No!

323
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:55,197
You'll learn to love
me more than him, Mother!

324
00:36:58,204 --> 00:36:59,535
Muneto...

325
00:36:59,705 --> 00:37:04,642
Join with the woman
and defeat this evil!

326
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,371
Who's talking?!

327
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:14,714
Use your love for the woman
as the power to destroy it!

328
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:17,221
- That voice...
- "Power?"

329
00:37:19,525 --> 00:37:23,825
Become one with the woman...
Become one with her...

330
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:25,887
I see.

331
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:28,363
The power of
two joined as one.

332
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:29,526
How do we do that?

333
00:37:29,602 --> 00:37:31,797
By becoming one.

334
00:37:31,871 --> 00:37:33,065
Muneto...

335
00:37:33,873 --> 00:37:36,569
All right.
For you, I'll do it.

336
00:37:38,244 --> 00:37:40,075
What is this energy?!

337
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:51,256
Mother!

338
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:55,254
Get off this world,
spawn of hell!

339
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:59,193
Mother! I'm your child!

340
00:37:59,565 --> 00:38:00,691
Get off this world!

341
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:04,869
No, Mother!
I want to stay with you!

342
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:12,272
I gave life to you...
And now I must take it back!

343
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:17,211
Don't do this, Mother!
Mother!

344
00:38:23,055 --> 00:38:27,719
No, I can't do it!
I can't kill you!

345
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:29,519
Get off this world!

346
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:31,824
Mother, please don't do this!

347
00:38:32,598 --> 00:38:37,626
Mother, I love you!

348
00:38:38,971 --> 00:38:42,338
MOTHER!!!

349
00:39:04,997 --> 00:39:07,363
Kayo... Kayo!

350
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:12,369
Muneto...
The monster...?

351
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:17,375
Yeah... He's gone.
Thanks to you.

352
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:19,502
But we lost so
many people doing it.

353
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:23,910
Kasu... Yagami...
Miki...

354
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:26,383
And you, Tsutomu.

355
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:29,320
They all died because of me.

356
00:39:29,388 --> 00:39:32,619
No, they died
to save the Earth.

357
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:33,716
Kayo...

358
00:39:33,926 --> 00:39:38,329
You can't take all the blame.
I was beside you all the way.

359
00:39:39,832 --> 00:39:42,733
Kayo...
Thanks to you.
