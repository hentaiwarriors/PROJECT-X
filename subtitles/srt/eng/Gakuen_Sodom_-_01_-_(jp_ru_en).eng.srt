1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,190
You're so damn pert!

2
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,460
Ouch!

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,910
You actually like being bullied,
don't you?

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,070
- Well?
- Oh, no!

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,410
God damn you! I'm bleeding!

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
You'll pay
a high price for this!

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,330
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Be still, will ya?

8
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,060
Okay. Spread her legs.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,900
What?
Oh, no-- Stop!

10
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,170
What a scorcher!

11
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,800
I can't take it!

12
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,490
What the hell?

13
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,690
What was <i>that</i> about?

14
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,740
Professor!

15
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,940
What is it, Yukika?

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,240
<i>Ms. Nogami</i>, sir.

17
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,940
Be that as it may, I request
we evacuate at once!

18
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,810
- Yeah, let's go!
- We'd better run quick!

19
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,040
You have nothing to worry about.

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,320
As long as I don't press
this button right here.

21
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,990
Professor, what have you done?

22
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,160
You're onto me, huh?
I like that--

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,000
You're Yuo Yamao, right?

24
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,970
I don't mind a woman like you.

25
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,010
I made it myself.
It's pretty powerful.

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,250
That one just now was
a timer-operated model.

27
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,350
This and all the other bombs
are remote-controlled.

28
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,760
I can detonate them at will
with this controller.

29
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,230
Of course, I've got some set up
here in this room.

30
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,660
No way. Why?

31
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,700
Please stop, Professor!

32
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,470
It's too late, Yuo.
It's already begun.

33
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,730
There's no turning back.
Nobody can stop it now.

34
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,050
You know...

35
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,050
I've always had my doubts about
the current educational system.

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,210
Knowledge by itself
is absolutely useless.

37
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,660
One must know
how to use it and why.

38
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,630
But this system is not meant
to teach you any of that.

39
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,390
It's wrong to just shove it
all down your throat.

40
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,490
So, I thought I would give you
my own special lesson.

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,830
The kind of lesson that
nobody else can teach...

42
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,870
"To know and understand one's path
is to die without regret."

43
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,350
- Know what I mean?
- You must be joking!

44
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,850
Why should I go along
with this nonsense?

45
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,580
I don't care what you do,
but I ain't getting mixed up!

46
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,060
If you wanna die, do it alone!

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,330
What's with the lamp?

48
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,730
It's warning that
the safety's disarmed.

49
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,790
With one touch of the button...

50
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,140
the whole university will
vanish without a trace.

51
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,680
Do you want me to end it
once and for all?

52
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,550
No! Please stop!

53
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,510
He's bluffiing!

54
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,950
"Bloody feisty in the morning,
dead as a doornail by the evening."

55
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,510
Get it?

56
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,150
What the hell!?

57
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,800
Can't you see he's serious?

58
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,160
Good for you,
Mr. Chemistry Club Member.

59
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,600
You realize it's neither
a bluff nor a mere threat.

60
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,160
I'm so tickled.

61
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,610
Know what?
We've got a long road ahead.

62
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,100
Why don't you be my assistant,
Mr. Mitsuya Kamishiro?

63
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,710
If you insist.

64
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,550
It's settled then!

65
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,680
Wait, wasn't there another
club member in this room--

66
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,820
There you are...
Mr. Naoto Murano, yes?

67
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,560
You'll be my assistant too.
Okay?

68
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,900
Oh, this is just great!
I'm so excited about this!

69
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,380
If only you were usually
this obedient...

70
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,010
my job would be so much easier.

71
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
Kanon.

72
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,280
You don't think you can get off
with a slap, do you?

73
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,380
What?

74
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,520
I'll appoint you as the first
subject of my special lesson.

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,720
- Ms. Motoi?
- Yes?

76
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,390
You can slap her.

77
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,460
What?

78
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,990
Haven't you had enough
of her bullying?

79
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,440
Go ahead and slap her.

80
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,410
But I--

81
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,940
Need I remind you of
what I saw earlier?

82
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,970
Oh, no! Please stop!

83
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,150
It ain't bad losing
your virginity to a mop.

84
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,920
If Mr. Murano hadn't
happened to come by...

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,430
it would have been
a real mess, no?

86
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,400
Don't you want to take revenge?

87
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,070
A cold-blooded bitch like her
should feel pain for herself.

88
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,330
Don't you agree?

89
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,640
What's the matter?
Do you mean to disobey me?

90
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,950
If so, I'll just have to
make you a subject too.

91
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,310
What?

92
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,910
That's outrageous, Professor!

93
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,620
Oh, you're against me too?

94
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,160
Mr. Kamishiro,
take care of her.

95
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,960
Don't!

96
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,520
Naoto.

97
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,000
"Depart ye; it is unclean--"

98
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,630
Don't touch me!

99
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,800
Don't <i>you</i> touch her!

100
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,080
Oh, my! My assistants are
having disagreements already?

101
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,510
That's a sad, sad thing.

102
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,780
By the way, I see you're
very learned, Mitsuya.

103
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,250
You've just quoted the Bible.

104
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,530
That's so stupid!

105
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,560
Why hurry off to death when
my lesson has yet to begin?

106
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,840
Anyhow, you're up fiirst,
Ms. Motoi.

107
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,050
Tawa!

108
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,610
Naoto.

109
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,850
No way.

110
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,280
One moment, Mitsuya.

111
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,480
Yes...

112
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,050
Murano, first...

113
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,500
we experiment with the physiological
structure of the human body.

114
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,400
I need your help with
our test subject, Ms. Motoi.

115
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:11,240
For the best possible view,
have her kindly strip for us, please.

116
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,010
Oh, no.

117
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,680
Ms. Motoi, be still.

118
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,520
Or else he might cut
more than what's necessary.

119
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,860
You have not only a baby face
but also an undeveloped body.

120
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,100
You should have reached
full growth by now.

121
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,500
Mitsuya, would you mind
lifting her pants up a little?

122
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,870
Women lack such male features
as the scrotum and the penis.

123
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,540
- See that?
- It hurts!

124
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,980
There's nothing down there,
you see?

125
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,920
Ms. Motoi, stick out your butt,
so everyone gets a good look.

126
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,460
That's right.

127
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,400
Mitsuya, will you
pull down her undies...

128
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,130
and show us
what she's all about?

129
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,400
No, don't look! Please!

130
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,810
Now I'd like you to observe
the female urinary system.

131
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,450
Instead of the penis...

132
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,220
women have a tiny hole called
the urethral opening.

133
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,050
That's where their pee comes out.

134
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,180
This drug will help
demonstrate my point.

135
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,960
It's so powerful
it'll work in no time.

136
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,230
It's started to work.

137
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,770
Please let me use the toilet.

138
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,540
No can do.
But you can use this instead.

139
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,220
Ms. Motoi must be dying
to pee just about now.

140
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,960
Oh, why not? Go already.

141
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,730
We're waiting, Ms. Motoi.

142
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,330
It's not healthy to hold it in.

143
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,270
No.

144
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,510
That's one way you get a bladder
infection. My father told me.

145
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,340
So let it go.

146
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,650
No! Don't look! Please!

147
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,930
You pissed a lot!

148
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,730
Tawa, thank you for
the great demonstration.

149
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,670
You're next, Kanon.

150
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,010
No!

151
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,240
You wouldn't do such a horrible
thing to me, would you?

152
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,080
Next we use Ms. Enami here for
an experiment on pain receptors.

153
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,050
No! Stop!

154
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,560
No!

155
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,410
How does it feel, Mitsuya?
Nice?

156
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,670
You earned that reward.

157
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,580
Tawa my dear,
you're remarkably obedient.

158
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,940
I suppose
it's a form of virtue.

159
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,050
Goes to show you...

160
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,420
the humans are an odd
species of animal, indeed.

161
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,490
I'm gonna cum!

162
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,470
Let's start our experiment
on Kanon, shall we?

163
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,900
Mitsuya, would you fondle
her breasts for us?

164
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,670
Well, aren't they soft?

165
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,710
With her formidable size,
she'll make a fine subject, I think.

166
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,330
I know about you.

167
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,030
Your bullying habit goes
way beyond Tawa, am I right?

168
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,570
All living things have
"nociceptors."

169
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,700
They're the receptors of pain
in the skin and flesh.

170
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,710
For instance.

171
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,120
It hurts, doesn't it?

172
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,280
But the breast is mostly
made up of fat.

173
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,950
While she feels the pain,
she's in no mortal danger.

174
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,830
So why, you might ask,
does it hurt so much?

175
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,990
The female breast is a crucial
organ for rearing children.

176
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,900
Therefore it's armed with
extra sensitivity as a protection.

177
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,270
So you see--

178
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,280
"Protect me. Let's get out of
this trouble immediately."

179
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,010
It sends a signal of pain
to the brain.

180
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,350
Painful?

181
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,070
I see, but I'm afraid
I can't stop yet.

182
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,230
Above all...

183
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,180
the nipple is the most crucial,
as it dispenses milk to babies.

184
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,970
Naturally it's one of
the most sensitive parts.

185
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,320
It might be the most
developed body part of all...

186
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,660
when it comes to nociceptors.

187
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,140
Oh, my. It's not over yet.
Mitsuya, wake her up, please.

188
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,830
There's an important
experiment to finish.

189
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,310
Yes, Professor.

190
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,380
Good. Stick your finger in there
and rub her real good.

191
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,640
When a pain persists beyond
the point one can tolerate...

192
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,580
the brain excretes an endorphin
similar to morphine.

193
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,780
This blissful substance functions
as a pain suppressor.

194
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,850
Then the pain slowly
turns into pleasure.

195
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,830
What a well-designed organism
the human body is.

196
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,360
The blissful substance stirs up
the core of pleasure.

197
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,030
It gives us the will to live.

198
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,730
It revives our so-called
survival instinct.

199
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,710
Invigorates us, you know?

200
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,900
Now that she's invigorated...

201
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,880
let us induce pain in another
part that's even more sensitive.

202
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,920
How's that, Kanon? Good?

203
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,790
Or is it merely painful?

204
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,130
Too bad, she's fainted.

205
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,500
I guess we'll never
know the answer.

206
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,290
- Hey, that's a TV chopper.
- We're rescued now!

207
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,060
Just as I planned.
It was I who informed them.

208
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,430
I told them all about the bombs
and about myself.

209
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,360
Yoshihiko Ohse!
Are you there?

210
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,040
Answer if you can hear us!
I know you can hear us, Ohse!

211
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,650
Will someone please draw
the curtains over the windows?

212
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,240
You don't want to get
sniped, do you?

213
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,150
Here! We're right here!

214
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,650
Professor, please stop this now.

215
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,060
There's no way in hell you could
win against that many people!

216
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,630
Keep it down, will you?

217
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,930
Well, let's see.

218
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,830
Oh, right, the people outside?

219
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,500
Actually the bombs are not
only inside the building.

220
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,250
They're also buried
in the ground.

221
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,080
If I were to blow the remaining
bombs all at once...

222
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:43,320
everyone on the premises would be
blown away without a trace.

223
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,760
These bombs are <i>that</i> powerful!

224
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,430
It can't be--

225
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,660
But this must be kept secret
from the people outside.

226
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,530
Or else someone might get
a naughty idea...

227
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,130
Oh, I know!

228
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:04,080
Yukika, will you tell them
not to get any foolish ideas?

229
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,980
Tell them there are
a lot of hostages at stake?

230
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,040
Yes.

231
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,820
Not like that though.

232
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,380
I mean, you have <i>media</i> out there.
Gotta give them more impact.

233
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,490
First off, I think
you can lose the clothes.

234
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,290
Mr. Kamishiro, Mr. Murano.

235
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,590
Yes.

236
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,200
No!

237
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,260
Please go away.

238
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,610
Why don't you all give a hand?

239
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,880
You guys are all joking, right?
Please stay away!

240
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,210
No! No!

241
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,960
Stop! No!

242
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,350
Yours are a different size
and shape from Ms. Enami's.

243
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,470
No, stop.

244
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,070
They feel a little harder
to the touch.

245
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,380
But this might make them as big
as Ms. Enami's, if not bigger...

246
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,090
the professor has
kindly suggested--

247
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,990
Well, look at that.
Looks much bigger.

248
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,630
- Stop! It hurts!
- I'll squeeze this one too.

249
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,900
No! Please stop! It hurts!

250
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,370
It hurts! Stop it!

251
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,020
Ready to say hello
to the people down there?

252
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,660
It hurts. Please, stop.

253
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,200
Hey, look at that!

254
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,110
Please don't! Stop!

255
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,340
What are they doing?

256
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,040
It's dangerous!

257
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,890
Wow! You can really
hang someone by the tits.

258
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,200
Pull her up, guys!

259
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,830
Well? Did you say hello
to everyone down there?

260
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,910
I'm asking you a question!

261
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,820
Don't!

262
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,880
Please don't look! Help me!

263
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,190
Don't look! Please don't!

264
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,720
All right, that's enough.

265
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,260
This time, a hello from below.

266
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,090
Guys, please?

267
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,000
What are you doing? Stop!

268
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,900
No! Don't!

269
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,350
No!

270
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,620
I see you.

271
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,230
It's tight. You nervous?

272
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,670
Know what might work?

273
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,170
My father made this muscle
relaxer for my shoulder aches.

274
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,080
I've got to give them
a good look inside too.

275
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,810
No. Stop. Please.

276
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,330
No. Stop it.

277
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,270
It's gotten much softer.
But my fingers are numb too.

278
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,070
How about this instead?

279
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,370
No! Don't! Please.

280
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,450
Wow! It goes in smooth.

281
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,780
It's still pretty tight deep inside.

282
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,050
I'll move it, okay?

283
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,800
I guess this is
what they were waiting for.

284
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,870
Go on, say hello.

285
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,380
Oh, no! Stop!

286
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,500
Mitsuya's become quite
a performer, indeed.

287
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,400
I don't see the need for
any more directions.

288
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,170
Here I come.

289
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,340
No!

290
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,850
A great shot,
don't you think, Yukika?

291
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,330
Frankly, the Japanese media is
so shameless if you ask me.

292
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,520
Just look at it.

293
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,430
- Holy shit! You can see it all!
- No touch-ups, man.

294
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,500
The truth is,
I sent an E-mail earlier saying...

295
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,970
"If you dare try any video FX,
I'll pull the trigger at once."

296
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,340
No!

297
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,110
Calm down, Yukika.

298
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,980
It's all right now.
Please calm down.

299
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,280
No. No.

300
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,620
It's all right now. Don't worry.

301
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,290
Professor,
the secretary's fallen apart.

302
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,060
I'm amazed at how fragile
the human spirit is.

303
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:34,000
I won't forgive you.
Your behavior is inhuman!

304
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:39,630
Really? So what are you going
to do about it, huh?

305
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,780
There's nothing I can do now.

306
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,240
But you haven't seen
the last of me yet!

307
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:50,210
Oh, I love it!
You're something else, Yuo.

308
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,380
I don't mind
your type of women at all.

309
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:54,040
In a field with
an oppressive fragrance

310
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:02,850
A proud and pristine flower blooms

311
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,330
The wind scatters its petals

312
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,530
They fly high up in the air
dancing haphazardly

313
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:23,940
At the bottom of the valley
a murky backwater gleams

314
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:32,220
I'll sail a boat named <i>Lust</i>

315
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:39,080
And drift aimlessly
through unknown places

316
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:45,220
Only to arrive
at a defiinite destination

317
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,790
So here I go

318
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,740
The flower, the moon, the world

319
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,970
Mark my name, my existence

320
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,100
Mark them firm and deep

321
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,480
Mark them till it hurts,
so it can't be erased

322
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:12,960
Recognize the sacred love
in my name, in my existence

323
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,230
I'll take this ache and
turn it into pleasure

324
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,500
Such is the power of temptation

325
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:28,270
I am about to
open its door for you
