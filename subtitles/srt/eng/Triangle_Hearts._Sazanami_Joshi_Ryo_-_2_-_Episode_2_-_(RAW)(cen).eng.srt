1
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,460
Oh, I gotta hurry up!

2
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,050
Kosuke-sama.

3
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,380
Izayoi-san.

4
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,510
Here you go.

5
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,630
Thank you!

6
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,480
Ai-san.

7
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,530
Chi-Chika-chan, my back.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,540
Alley-oop.

9
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,020
Minami-chan, you rock!

10
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,060
Fear not my minions! More people in the house will not mean less food for you! I'll make sure of it!

11
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,230
Yes? Sazanami Girls' Dorm.

12
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,270
SubDESU-H Presents
Triangle Heart
Sazanami Girls Dorm

13
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,640
Huh?

14
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,880
I-I'm Makihara Kosuke from the Sazanami Girls' Dorm.

15
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,200
Ah! Good afternoon! Pleased to meet you. I'm Shiina.

16
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,960
Oh, so have you already met everyone?

17
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,650
Yes, during winter break.

18
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,750
Ah, except Minami-chan.

19
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,340
Speaking of which, how long has it been now, Minami-chan?

20
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,350
Uh...

21
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,020
Didn't Minami-chan come here in April?

22
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,350
Yep! Pleased to meet you! I'm Okamoto Minami.

23
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,770
Pleased to meet you! I'm Shiina Yuuhi.

24
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,020
By the way, I'm the manager, the cook...

25
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,370
AND garbage boy!

26
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,740
Onee-chan!

27
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,970
Well, it's true ain't it?

28
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,540
Yep, that's all my job. I'm Makihara Kosuke.

29
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,920
Right.  Looking forward to living with you all.

30
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,660
Alright, shall we get started?

31
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,450
Let's eat!

32
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,810
Hey! I was going for that!

33
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,200
Let go!

34
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,230
No way, I'm going for it.

35
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,390
Hey!

36
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,690
Bwahahaha...! {<-- while eating the big shrimp}

37
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,360
Seconds, Kosuke!

38
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,470
Really pile it on!

39
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,240
Here you go.

40
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
Sorry, Ai-san.

41
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,100
No problem.

42
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,020
Ai-san, if you would please.

43
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,290
Of course.

44
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,450
Hee hee. Well, isn't that strange.

45
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,590
You guys talk back and forth like a married couple.

46
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,890
Y-You've got it wrong!

47
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,230
Yeah, she's right.

48
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,690
It's just that we have known each other for a while now.

49
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,980
Yeah, it's not like that at all.

50
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,700
Yeah, she can't get married!

51
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,430
She is married to dorm life.

52
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,030
Mio-chan!

53
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,710
Well, it isn't surprising actually.

54
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,490
Yeah, you guys really are always together.

55
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,450
You guys are looking into it too much.

56
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,980
Yeah, that's about what I thought.

57
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,460
Uh... Shiina-san you are in choir aren't you?

58
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,880
Yes, starting this semester.

59
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,260
So then you must be a great singer.

60
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,470
Oh, no... I'm not really that great.

61
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,980
Well, I can do this much...

62
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,190
Thanks!

63
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,430
Wow, that was awesome!

64
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,340
Shiina-san really is beautiful, don't you think?

65
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,640
Yeah, no kidding!

66
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,500
She is tall, pretty, and has great style.

67
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,130
Chika, you're pretty and your style sense is pretty good too.

68
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,210
What? That's not true. Besides, my boobs are too small.

69
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,400
Hey, Chika-chan... are you an A-cup?

70
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,070
Yeah, 65-A...

71
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,820
69-A...

72
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,070
Twins!

73
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,990
I'm beginning to think they're getting too muscular.

74
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,450
Really? They look perfectly soft to me.

75
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,870
Hmm? I don't think so.

76
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,050
C-Can I touch them?

77
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,550
Well, I, uh... guess.

78
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,330
Just as I thought. They feel nice to the touch.

79
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,600
Can I touch yours as well?

80
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,310
Uh, go ahead.

81
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,700
Uh... Sorry to interrupt.

82
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,120
D-Did I surprise you?

83
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,000
Are you okay?

84
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,450
We're fine!

85
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,130
Oh, hey. The cat is taking a bath!

86
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,520
Yeah, Tara-chan loves the bath.

87
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,960
Oh, you're a little water snake.

88
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,440
You're so little and cute.

89
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,190
So what do you think of this place, Shiina-san?

90
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,410
Oh, it's great. It's like a home away from home.

91
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,020
Yep.

92
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,580
The manager's food is delicious, too.

93
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,100
No kidding!

94
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,710
So what's up with Kaoru-chan?

95
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,550
She doesn't seem to smile much.

96
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,890
I wonder if something happened to her.

97
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,800
Kaoru-san is always like that.

98
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,550
Yeah, That samurai thing is kind of her deal.

99
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,390
She isn't a samurai! She is a separatist!

100
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:55,570
Speaking of which, Kaoru-san is a sweet person, but I have never really seen her smile.

101
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,520
Here you go.

102
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,450
Thanks!

103
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,400
Oh, delicious!

104
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,070
Kosuke. I need some cat food. It's time for my meeting!

105
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,590
Yep! I just finished it!

106
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,250
Here you go.

107
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,500
Thanks, Kosuke!

108
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,260
Her... meeting?

109
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,510
Oh! Minami-san, there is an NBA match on TV tonight.

110
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,060
Oh, I don't want to miss that!

111
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,330
Speaking of which, sorry about earlier.

112
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,040
I mean putting you two on the spot like that.

113
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,870
Oh, that! It's no biggie.

114
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,200
That aside, it really is nice to have a manager that is so good in the kitchen.

115
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,230
Not at all.

116
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,840
Have you been here a while?

117
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,970
It hasn't even been 6 months yet. I've only been here since spring break.

118
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,980
Good evening.

119
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,150
Good evening!

120
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,020
Uh, Kaoru-chan.

121
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,340
Yes?

122
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Hey, what do you think about grabbing some tea?

123
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,070
Sorry, I have to practice.

124
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,920
Kanzaki House of the 5-Arm Earth-Dragon Wind-Sword School...

125
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,550
She does kendo.

126
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,880
Oh, so that's what she meant by being a samurai.

127
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,040
She does seem like that.

128
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,680
Be back later!

129
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,310
See you later!

130
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,750
Shiina-san. Have you already been to school today?

131
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,340
Yeah, I only had two classes today.

132
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,430
W-What's that?

133
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,850
Eh, don't worry about it.

134
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,060
Oh, is it for a concert?

135
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,230
Nope. It's for the dorm!

136
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,520
Everyone seems so energetic, but Kaoru-chan never laughs.

137
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,690
Right...

138
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:43,650
So I...

139
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,310
I'm gonna give her a great big comedic punch in the face!

140
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,270
Oh, so that's the kinda character you are...

141
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,950
Oh, I'm definitely that character!

142
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,110
Now then...

143
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,010
How about I make you a part of my ultra-secret plan?

144
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,800
I have arrived.

145
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,830
Welcome back.

146
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,430
I'm going to have some water.

147
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,780
Thank you very much.

148
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,090
Hey, what was up with that delivery, Mr. Manager!

149
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,890
You say that, but...

150
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,810
You were supposed to say "What's up Kaoru-chan?" then I was gonna say...

151
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,850
We're home!

152
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,520
Hey, Kosuke-san. What is up for today's snacks?

153
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,440
Oh, welcome home!

154
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,390
Did you finally start growing a mustache?

155
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:07,680
What was that?

156
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,660
See? That was executed perfectly!

157
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,870
Shit! Now we have to come up with a different plan for Kaoru-chan.

158
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,170
What the heck is that all about?

159
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:23,870
No clue.

160
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:31,880
Shiina-san and Nii-chan were determined to get Kaoru-san to laugh so...

161
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,900
Ah! Delicious!

162
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,310
Thanks for the food.

163
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,310
It's the phone.

164
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,560
Hello?

165
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,050
Bum-ba-da-bum!

166
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:49,710
I'm Yuuhi.

167
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,630
And I'm Kosuke.

168
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,170
I find that if I sleep on a beach, I sleep too long. {The following joke makes absolutely NO sense in English since it is Rakugo so I switched it up a bit}

169
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,170
Well, then you are a sandman! But there is nothing wrong with beauty sleep!

170
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,040
Oh, and how long is that?

171
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,090
Just once.

172
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,210
Just once? What does that mean?

173
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,400
It's a mysterious question but you have to keep a balance!

174
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,230
So how do we solve it?

175
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,690
I don't know. I can sleep a whole week!

176
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,480
What? Well, then you are oversleeping, beauty!

177
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,080
Thank you very much!

178
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,600
I'm sorry but it's time for practice...

179
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,170
They tried lots of things but nothing seemed to help.

180
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,085
They spent a lot of time planning stuff,

181
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:39,282
and all their time together started making them seem like old friends.

182
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,430
It's about 1 week until Kaoru-chan's birthday. We have to win this Performer Challenge before then.

183
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,640
Wait... What do you mean "Performer"? Why...?

184
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,110
Oh, it's fine! Leave it up to me.

185
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,200
Yes, 8 o'clock exactly.

186
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Yes, I think it will be around then.

187
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,420
Okay, understood. See you later.

188
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,810
Something wrong?

189
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,130
Nah... They just said to come back at exactly 8 o'clock.

190
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:24,520
Oh, I see. It's your birthday so they must be planning a party.

191
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,270
It would honestly be kind of embarrassing if they did.

192
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,110
Oh, it's fine, don't you think? They are all so kind.

193
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,570
Yes, I am always thankful for that.

194
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,910
Okay, all of my preparations are complete.

195
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,380
Excellent, Mio-chan. I expect no less from the Lord of the Cats.

196
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,000
Yes. You may bow before me if you like.

197
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,010
Alright. That's a good girl.

198
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,340
I wonder what Yuuhi-chan is doing?

199
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,030
Honestly, let's just say it's going to be dramatic.

200
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,570
Sorry. Could you wait and see?

201
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,690
Got it.

202
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,930
I have returned.

203
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,840
Happy Birthday!

204
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,470
Thank you.

205
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,740
Happy Happy Happy Kaoru-chan.

206
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,230
Happy Happy Happy Kaoru-chan.

207
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,350
Happy Happy Happy Birthday

208
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,400
Congratulations.

209
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,320
Are those fireworks?

210
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,460
Happy Birthday!

211
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,560
Soooo cute!

212
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,490
But seriously, these getups are incredible!

213
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,270
Kosuke-kun made them.

214
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,100
I wasn't really sure they would hold up.

215
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,250
But it really puts you in the mood. Chika, should we grab our summer kimonos?

216
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,840
Sounds good!

217
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,870
Let's all go change.

218
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,630
Even Kaoru, right?

219
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,090
I... uh... don't have a summer kimono.

220
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,850
Don't worry about it. You can borrow one of mine.

221
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,900
So then we all put on our summer kimonos and had a little fireworks display.

222
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,280
It was the first time Chika ever saw Kaoru-san really laugh.

223
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:32,080
I thought to myself, Onii-chan and Yuuhi really are something.

224
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,880
Success. {<-- she just says 'circle' I really don't know what else it could mean} {QCer's Note: we sure that's not supposed to be circle? looks like she made a circle out of what I think is a Sparkler}

225
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,400
Okay, so tell me. Why were you so obsessed with getting Kaoru to laugh?

226
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,110
I really like playing the part of a comedy actress.

227
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,280
Girls need laughter in their life.

228
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,895
Through bad times and painful times, everyone has to deal.

229
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:38,325
But if a girl can't laugh now and then it just isn't life.

230
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,020
Yeah.

231
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:46,900
There was also that it was just fun doing stupid things with you.

232
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:58,040
After all, girls just wanna have fun! Don't ya think?

233
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,290
I guess it's because you're always laughing?

234
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,340
I'm always laughing so...?

235
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,400
Yuuhi, I...

236
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,370
You don't have to say anything.

237
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,710
Kosuke-kun.

238
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,510
I'm gonna...

239
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,710
I-I'm embarrassed.

240
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,770
K-Kosuke-kun.

241
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,970
I'm cumming...

242
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,180
A dream?

243
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,990
If you don't hurry you're gonna be late.

244
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,320
I know!

245
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,110
Chika-chan, wait up!

246
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,640
Have a good day!

247
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,990
See you later.

248
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:04,990
Now then...

249
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:18,760
Kaoru-chan?

250
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,550
Uh, I...

251
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,640
See you later!

252
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,970
Have a good day!
