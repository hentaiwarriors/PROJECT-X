1
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:25,533
Time has passed quickly. Cain has
become a great Lord, loved by the people here.

2
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,138
However, it is not all good news.

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,942
Norland was viciously attacked
by the armies of Tedmond.

4
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:38,812
We're losing the war and they're stealing our land.

5
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:42,807
The resolve of our people is
being pushed to the limits.

6
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:48,215
Our Lord is having a hard time
dealing with everything.

7
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,996
It is our duty to comfort him
and take his mind off things.

8
00:00:56,099 --> 00:01:01,765
That is how I spend my nights,
doing the best I can to him.

9
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,402
Boss, you're so good! You're amazing.

10
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:09,638
I'm going to die in ecstasy!

11
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,531
Are you alright, Sir?.

12
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:34,863
Yeah. That was great, Tia. You're awesome!

13
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:39,266
Thank you. I'm so happy you enjoyed it.

14
00:01:55,626 --> 00:02:01,531
Charlotte will return from her
studies at the monastery in months.

15
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:05,066
Then she'll celebrate her twentieth birthday.

16
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:11,002
It's also the day we'll find out who
the Princess' husband will be.

17
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:16,603
If Francis is chosen as her husband...

18
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:20,210
What happens to us as we're at war?.

19
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:24,015
We'll either be killed...or become slaves.

20
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:25,788
No! I couldn't...

21
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:30,054
I could never go back to being a slave!

22
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,725
That's the reality of it.

23
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:36,464
We have no choice but to
accept whatever happens.

24
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:41,400
Please don't say things like that, Chiffon!

25
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:46,434
Ann, what are the dwarves'
feelings about the future?.

26
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:48,339
Ah...Yes..Well...

27
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:53,210
Our position will never change. We remain neutral.

28
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,244
But we will protect our woods at all costs.

29
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:01,218
Why?.! You live here in Norland just like us.

30
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:04,292
Why won't you fight with us?.

31
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:07,497
I...I don't know what to say...

32
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:13,867
Tia! Stop it! Ann is the dwarven ambassador!

33
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:16,739
You should not speak to her like that!

34
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:23,104
I'm sorry. I just got upset.

35
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:26,582
Tia, please don't cry!

36
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:31,146
If only Tsubaki were here.

37
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:35,457
She could kick Tedmond's army ass!

38
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,330
In these difficult times, she is
nowhere to be found...

39
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,560
...Ieaving us no means to
even contact her.

40
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:48,429
Where do her loyalties lie?.

41
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:55,468
Tsubaki left to continue her training...
to help protect Norland.

42
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:59,905
Stop it! Both of you! Even if
Tsubaki were here...

43
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,211
...she couldn't defeat Tedmond all by herself.

44
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:07,548
We have to stand together these days!

45
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:10,785
This is no time for arguing!

46
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,593
It's been years since I became the Lord here.

47
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:19,266
Chiffon has been my advisor from day one.

48
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,163
But still I feel she distances herself from us.

49
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:40,650
Our target tonight is a
Tedmond warehouse, boys.

50
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:44,085
Francis is making money hand over fist in this war.

51
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:48,423
Don't feel bad to take whatever
you get your hands on!

52
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:49,632
Yes, Sis!

53
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,035
Stupid! I told you to call me Leader!

54
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,462
S...Sorry!

55
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:59,800
Tedmond is winning and keeping
all their spoils of war in one location.

56
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:02,668
That makes it easier for us to do our jobs.

57
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:06,548
Norland doesn't even have
a pot to piss in anymore.

58
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:09,476
I don't care about their war.

59
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,047
We just steal from whoever has the money.

60
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:16,553
Let's go!

61
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:18,223
Yeah!

62
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,385
What's wrong, Leader?.

63
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:54,188
This is too easy.

64
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,505
I can't possibly ask anymore of our people.

65
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:05,403
We have no military power.

66
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:20,548
I'm too tired to even think.

67
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:23,726
I should just get to bed and
worry about it tomorrow.

68
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:09,037
Why does this happen to me?.

69
00:07:14,544 --> 00:07:15,943
Aren't you done yet?.

70
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:19,541
Don't rush me, please!
Just a little more...

71
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,080
It's the end of the line for you, bandit!

72
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:29,219
Shit! It's a trap!

73
00:07:30,894 --> 00:07:34,261
Thay're gonna kill us if they catch us.

74
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:37,224
Do whatever you have to to escape!

75
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:38,233
Yeah!

76
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:39,959
Arrest them!

77
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:53,105
You!

78
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,218
Stop them!

79
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,466
Get out of our way!

80
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:29,218
Leader!

81
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,126
Leader...

82
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:57,372
Time to tell us what you know. Out with it!

83
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,383
I've endured harder whippings from slave traders.

84
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:11,285
Stubborn bitch! Where's the rest of your
gang hiding?. Where's your loot?.

85
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:13,922
You have to have a hideout somewhere. Tell us!

86
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:18,128
Hit her!

87
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,949
I've never seen anyone withstand
such pain. Even a man.

88
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,316
I'm impressed.

89
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:49,524
You've got a pretty nice pussy for a bandit!

90
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,444
What's up?. You're getting wet.

91
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:14,519
Are we not having fun yet?.

92
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:16,456
We aim to please all our visitors here.

93
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:22,396
The Tedmond police know how to
take care of our guests.

94
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:29,902
Wh..What are you doing?.

95
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:33,602
It's a special service we offer.

96
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:37,212
If you don't like it, just tell us
where your hideout is.

97
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:40,707
I'll never tell!

98
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:48,585
Is this all you've got?.!

99
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:01,230
Anything yet?.

100
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:03,738
She is much more stubborn than I expected.

101
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:16,514
Interesting woman. Let me handle this!

102
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:22,088
Woman. Put this in your mouth.

103
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,885
Francis, that's very dangerous.

104
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:27,820
If she bites you...

105
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:32,291
If that happens, we'll kill them all.

106
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:35,296
Do it, bandit!

107
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:36,639
Never!

108
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:45,077
Leader. Don't worry about us!

109
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:50,778
Damn you!

110
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:00,923
Good. Keep going!

111
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:06,702
Get me off and you get time
off for good behavior.

112
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:28,247
Good. Here we go...

113
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,362
Swallow it!

114
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:48,507
You whore.

115
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,684
Leader...I'm sorry...

116
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:19,230
So what do you do about the dwarves?.
They show no sign of leaving.

117
00:13:19,642 --> 00:13:21,200
Just leave them be!

118
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:24,744
When this country is mine,
they'll be forced to obey me.

119
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:27,747
Yes, sir!

120
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:38,389
Tia!

121
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:42,224
I'm sorry!

122
00:14:15,798 --> 00:14:18,665
Tia, your cooking has really improved.

123
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:21,762
It's a vast improvement over
when you started here.

124
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,300
Th...Thank you so much.

125
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:30,139
But I've had trouble with the menus
as there's not enough food anymore.

126
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,776
The farmers have been injured in
battle and the fields are destroyed.

127
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:44,682
But we should appreciate how
good these mountain vegtables taste.

128
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:51,763
Y..Yes. These mushrooms and
sweet potatoes are quite good.

129
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:58,499
But it's hard for growing kids to
eat such things everyday.

130
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:02,969
T..That's true...

131
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,544
Chiffon! Please don't make this
conversation so serious.

132
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:14,713
Let's at least have some fun at dinner.

133
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,988
There are so many people suffering
out there right now.

134
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:20,522
Is that fun?.

135
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:22,188
B..But..

136
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,767
It's OK, Tia.

137
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:27,334
Boss...

138
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:31,239
As Lord, this is all my fault.

139
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:37,403
I'm so ashamed that I can't provide
for you or my people.

140
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:01,293
Oh, right there, My Lord.

141
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:07,099
I love having beautiful creatures like you around.

142
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:12,747
You're like living art that responds to my touch.

143
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:20,219
Charlotte, my bride to be, must surely
have grown into a beautiful woman by now.

144
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:26,194
Soon, she will wallow in pleasure as my wife.

145
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:50,919
Charlotte, I've tried my best to
become your future husband.

146
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:56,024
But my land is in ruins and my people are suffering.

147
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:00,229
Elise!

148
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,493
It's been a while. What's happened?.
You don't look good.

149
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:09,599
Surely you know.

150
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,805
You see everything that happens
in this land, right?.

151
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:19,909
I can't do this anymore. I should
have stayed a simple shepherd.

152
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,411
You can't give up just yet.

153
00:17:23,953 --> 00:17:26,945
Give up?. Why would you say
something so stupid?.

154
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:30,384
How can I turn this situation in my favor?.

155
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:35,658
Ask Chiffon. Have her use her wizardry.

156
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,829
Wizardry?.

157
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,465
She's half human, half Dark Elf.

158
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,569
Dark Elves have strong magic powers.

159
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,540
I've never seen Chiffon use any magic.

160
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:53,609
And she doesn't even try to be
friendly with any of us.

161
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,215
It's like she doesn't even care
that Norland is losing.

162
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:00,821
Have you ever asked her why?.

163
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:01,990
The reason?.

164
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:09,122
I never asked her why.

165
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:13,360
It was pretty rough again today...

166
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:17,769
but at least we can appreciate
having dinner together like this.

167
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:20,742
This is so good.

168
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:28,376
Is something wrong, My Lord?.

169
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:32,854
Tonight, you're my partner.

170
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:56,168
Chiffon...

171
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:57,244
Yes.

172
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:04,179
As you're well aware, Norland is
in serious trouble.

173
00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:11,124
You're an elven wizard, sent by the church.

174
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:15,024
But I've never seen you use any magic.

175
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:18,028
Can you really use magic?.

176
00:19:19,502 --> 00:19:22,528
I been so long since I've used it... I don't know anymore.

177
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:27,667
Can you use your power to help our people?.

178
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:34,540
I don't concern myself with the wars of humans.

179
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:41,019
I was born half human, half Elf.

180
00:19:41,123 --> 00:19:42,920
But I soon found that there was no
place for me in either world.

181
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:46,285
I was an outcast from the time I was a child.

182
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:01,632
And I was considered different and unique...

183
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:06,347
I was raped and abused by human men.

184
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:13,186
I was taken in by the church and became a wizard.

185
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:17,457
But I still have a deep rooted mistrust of humans.

186
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:24,260
I came here simply as a favor for
the church after all they'd done for me.

187
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,491
That's the only reason.

188
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:30,731
My Lord?.!

189
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:38,470
I'm so sorry. Sorry to stir
such painful memories.

190
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:43,712
As a human,
please accept my apologies.

191
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:50,692
Here I've been having sex with you,
thinking nothing of it. I'm just as guilty.

192
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:54,085
I've been blind to the pain you've
kept bottled up inside.

193
00:20:54,964 --> 00:20:57,694
I am a horrible person. How can I call myself a Lord?.

194
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:06,802
My Lord, you're not...

195
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:14,648
You're not like that.

196
00:21:17,953 --> 00:21:20,683
Chiffon, your body is warm.

197
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:24,923
I am...warm.

198
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:08,099
My Lord!

199
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:14,966
I've never seen you get like this, Chiffon.

200
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:30,725
That feels wonderful!

201
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:46,301
I'm on fire!

202
00:23:01,257 --> 00:23:02,451
Could this be...?.

203
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:07,057
My Lord, don't worry about that now.

204
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:10,056
OK.

205
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,241
This...This is unreal, Chiffon.

206
00:23:31,587 --> 00:23:33,214
I've never felt like this before.

207
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:34,954
That's good to hear.

208
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,518
Keep enjoying it.

209
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:56,810
My Lord, don't hold back.

210
00:24:09,258 --> 00:24:11,351
Chiffon!

211
00:24:24,873 --> 00:24:27,501
It's inside me! Deep inside me!

212
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:30,073
What's inside you?.

213
00:24:31,247 --> 00:24:32,544
My Lord's...

214
00:24:35,951 --> 00:24:38,545
Say it or I'll take it out!

215
00:24:38,954 --> 00:24:41,479
Your cock! Your big cock!!

216
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:35,109
My Lord, you're different.

217
00:25:36,945 --> 00:25:41,746
You taught me how warm a
human's heart can be.

218
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:47,979
I will light up my life for you.

219
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:00,229
I smell blood.

220
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,236
If these Norlanders had just left,
they wouldn't have to go through this.

221
00:26:07,242 --> 00:26:10,234
You sound happy.

222
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,177
Of course, you can enjoy war
when you're winning.

223
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:19,816
That's true. We can have their
money and their women.

224
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:22,648
Hey, you! What did you just say?.

225
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,985
Have you attacked Norland?.

226
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,498
Whoa. We can't see your face but...

227
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:32,597
You'll soon be ours.

228
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,563
I'm not in a forgiving mood!

229
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,405
What?.! You little bitch!

230
00:26:41,944 --> 00:26:43,536
She's...She's the woman who...

231
00:26:43,946 --> 00:26:45,538
She beat Bagwell!

232
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,460
Do you want to try your luck too?.

233
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:40,628
The smell of blood does not wash out easily.

234
00:27:53,582 --> 00:27:55,413
What...What the..?.!

235
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:05,716
Boss...What happen to Norland?.
