1
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,860
Do me harder!

2
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,700
l want you to mess up my cunt!

3
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,700
lt's going in deeper!

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,680
l can feel your cock deep inside!

5
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,650
lt's amazing.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,230
l want it...

7
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,270
l want it too...

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,430
l want your rock hard cock!

9
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,750
l think l'm...

10
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,950
l'm...

11
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,290
l'm...

12
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,880
Kasumi-san...

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,490
<i>The Hills Have Size Vol. 1 Erroneous Night</i>

14
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,530
<i>Matsubara</i>

15
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,920
Onii-chan! Rise and shine!

16
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,960
Come on!

17
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,860
Come on, wake up.

18
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,170
Mio?

19
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,600
Hurry.

20
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,470
Come and eat breakfast with me.

21
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,840
Okay, Onii-chan?

22
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,120
Come on Onii-chan.

23
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,450
All right, just don't pull my arm.

24
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,460
Good morning sleepyhead.

25
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,700
Harumi-san? What are you doing here?

26
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,630
Eating breakfast.

27
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,040
Now you sit here Onii-chan, right next to me.

28
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,300
He's finally up mama, get him some food!

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,500
All right.

30
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,400
l'll get it right now.

31
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,830
What's wrong Ryo-kun?

32
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,790
No, it's just...

33
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,900
Good morning Kasumi-san.

34
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,030
Good morning.

35
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,900
Itadakimasu!

36
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,310
Eat it before it gets cold, Ryo-kun.

37
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,910
Yes, thank you.

38
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,100
Did you get your room cleaned up?

39
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,970
l'm almost done.

40
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,780
You know why Harumi didn't come yesterday?

41
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,910
She didn't want to help you move your things.

42
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,490
lt's not fair.

43
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,860
lsn't it obvious?

44
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,920
Even if l help him out, l get nothing in return.

45
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,560
Don't be mean, Harumi-chan.

46
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,730
Ryo-kun always takes care of you.

47
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,300
lt doesn't hurt to help him, you know.

48
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,400
You don't seem to understand, sis.

49
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,840
l'm taking care of Ryo.

50
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,330
lsn't that right, Ryo?

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,870
Well, l don't know about that.

52
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,440
Did you say something?

53
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,750
Well, um, no. You're right.

54
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,350
Anyway, l can't believe you'll be staying at my sister's place.

55
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,890
l'm the one who's really surprised.

56
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,290
But are you sure you're okay with Ryo?

57
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,430
l realize he was nearby, but if something does happen...

58
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,500
...l don't think he's reliable.

59
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,730
Harumi-chan!

60
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:19,040
When the burglar came two days ago, Ryo-kun was there to scare him off.

61
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,650
The burglar came in since you forgot to lock the windows right?

62
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,180
Well it's just that l didn't think we'd get burglarized.

63
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,320
lf you're careless like that, you're always going to get robbed.

64
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,890
ln fact, you've always been so clumsy.

65
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,200
Look at the bright side.

66
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,970
l know that Kasumi-san's jewelry was stolen, but the burglar didn't steal anything else.

67
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,870
Well, l guess you're right.

68
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,470
But what bothers me most...

69
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,850
...is the fact that your husband showed up two days ago only to say hello...

70
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,180
...even though we were burglarized.

71
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,490
He's a very busy person...

72
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,980
Thank you for the meal.

73
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,670
But papa's coming back today.

74
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,130
l see.

75
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,540
He said he might be done with his work.

76
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,830
You can stay for dinner right?

77
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,440
Yes. l don't really have any plans.

78
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
l'm glad.

79
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,410
Then tonight will be a welcome party for you, Ryo-kun.

80
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,610
l have to prepare a feast.

81
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,310
Really mama?

82
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,250
Yes, l have to do a good job.

83
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,990
Oh my, look at the time, Mio.

84
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,420
You have to hurry.

85
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,790
Oh no!

86
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,200
Well, see you later!

87
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,440
l'm late...

88
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,040
She's full of energy.

89
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,630
Hey Ryo, you said you have no plans today, right?

90
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,130
Yeah.

91
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,330
Well, l want to talk to you about something.

92
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,260
Can you come to that coffee shop later?.

93
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,740
Let's see... How about 1 PM?

94
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,700
The one in front of the university?

95
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,670
Sure.

96
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,110
Okay, we're good.

97
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,610
Don't be late.

98
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,580
Don't ask him to do too much, Harumi-chan.

99
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,050
l'm sure he's tired after moving in.

100
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,650
l'm not asking him to do anything.

101
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,390
l just want to ask him something.

102
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,330
lt's okay, Kasumi-san.

103
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,160
l'm almost done unpacking my things.

104
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:55,960
But...

105
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,100
Right?

106
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,570
He says he's okay sis.

107
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,940
Then l'll see you later, Ryo.

108
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,240
Thanks for the breakfast, sis!

109
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,180
l'm sorry about all this, Ryo-kun.

110
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,860
Don't worry. l'll be just...

111
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,620
...fine...

112
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,200
Plus Harumi-san is your sister, so...

113
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,000
What?

114
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:36,100
l mean, she's the sister of the person who takes care of me...

115
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,150
Well, l gotta go clean up my room before l go meet her.

116
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,060
The room is all cleaned up.

117
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,770
l guess l'll take a shower.

118
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,930
Kasumi-san.

119
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,160
l'd like to use the shower.

120
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,300
Kasumi-san?

121
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,670
Did she go out shopping?

122
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,740
Oh well.

123
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,380
Where's the shower room...

124
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,540
What? Wait, um...

125
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,180
Ryo-kun!?

126
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,160
Welcome.

127
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,260
Over here Ryo.

128
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,200
Ryo-kun.

129
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,430
Ryo-kun.

130
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,200
Ryo-kun.

131
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,310
Wake up Ryo-kun!

132
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,020
Ryo-kun.

133
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,870
Are you okay Ryo-kun?

134
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,240
Kasumi-san!

135
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,500
Are you sure you're okay?

136
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,450
l'm okay.

137
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,210
Ouch!

138
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,920
Ryo-kun!

139
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,360
Ouch...

140
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,570
Ryo-kun?

141
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,480
l'm sorry.

142
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,110
lt was an accident...

143
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,550
l'm...

144
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,620
l'm really sorry!

145
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,000
Ryo!

146
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,170
What's wrong with you?

147
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,640
You came here all sweaty and now you're daydreaming.

148
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,770
Are you listening to me?

149
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,110
Sorry.

150
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,320
What were you saying?

151
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,210
l was saying...

152
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,030
What type of girls do you like?

153
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,330
What type of girls?

154
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,030
Why?

155
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,030
You have a preference, right?

156
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,970
Friendly ones, intellectual ones, dominating ones...

157
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,010
Then don't you know any girls that you like who are close to you?

158
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,670
Well?

159
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,620
Kasumi-san...

160
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,290
What's wrong, Ryo?

161
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,200
lsn't there a girl that you really like?

162
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,530
One girl who you constantly think about.

163
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,170
Well?

164
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,950
Ryo's an idiot.

165
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,460
He just doesn't know.

166
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,420
l was telling him all those things, but he still doesn't realize it.

167
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,820
So insensitive!

168
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,840
Harumi-san.

169
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,190
Harumi-san.

170
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,300
Ryo...

l wonder what Ryo thinks of me...

191
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,710
Welcome back Onii-chan.

192
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,850
Hey Ryoji, welcome back.

193
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,940
We were waiting for you.

194
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,180
Long time no see, sir.

195
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,020
Are you done cleaning up your room?

196
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,090
Yes.

197
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,650

198
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,990
Well anyway, let's just celebrate.

199
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,290
We're going to drink a lot tonight!

200
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,200
Yes.

201
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,960
lt's been a long time since we drank together, l was looking forward to this.

202
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,660
Let's drink.

203
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,710
No!

204
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,400
Not before he eats dinner with us.

205
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,100
You can drink with him later!

206
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,120
You'll understand it when you get older, Mio.

207
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,850
Well, l'd like to go take a quick shower if you don't mind...

208
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,010
Sure.

209
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,280
l'll just start drinking while l wait.

210
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,860
Mio, l want you to take his place and drink with me.

211
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,930
What?

212
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,850
All right then.

213
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,020
But l'll be drinking some juice.

214
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,150
l think l drank too much.

215
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,540
Honey...

216
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,380
l was waiting for you.

217
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,580
But you already went to sleep, it's not fair.

218
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,050
What am l supposed to do?

219
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,890
l don't want to use this toy...

220
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,330
l want you to do me with your cock.

221
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,630
l'm getting so wet because l want it.

222
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,980
But you...

223
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,420
l don't care whose cock it is...

224
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,990

225
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,490
l want someone to look at me.

226
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,760
Wait... Ryo-kun was looking at me.

227
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,000
He was looking at my naked body.

228
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,940
His cock was so big after looking at me.

229
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,980
He looked at me.

230
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,710
Ryo-kun looked at my naked body.

231
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,990
He was staring at me.

232
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,920
Ryo-kun!

233
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,630
l wish this was Ryo-kun's huge cock...

234
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,660
Feels good...

235
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,000
Ryo-kun's cock feels so good...

236
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,670

238
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,010
Ryo-kun!

239
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,050
Kasumi-san!

240
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,850
Ryo-kun?

241
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,330
No!

242
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,960
Ryo-kun, no!

243
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,870
We can't do this!

244
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,230
No!

245
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,700

246
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,980

No!

253
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,030
You said you wanted me.

254
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,940
But this is wrong.

255
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,840
No, please don't.

256
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,840
Don't be so rough!

257
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,710

258

Last night l...

280
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,710
You don't have to say anything.

281
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,450
You were drunk, besides...

282
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,860
...it's my fault for doing such a thing...

283
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,920
So you don't have to apologize.

284
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,760
But...

285
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,160
Let's forget about what happened last night.

286
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,170
l want you to forget everything that happened, please.

287
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,950
l want you to forget everything that happened.

288
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,460

289
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,210
Ryo-kun!

290
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,480
l can't forget about it.

291
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,220
How can l forget about it?

292
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,560
Calm down, Ryo-kun...

293
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,820
Stop it Ryo-kun.

294
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,860
Please...

295
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,200
Please don't do this.

296
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,740
This is wrong Ryo-kun.

297
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,270
You're the one who's cruel.

298
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,940
l don't want to betray Hisashi-san anymore.

299
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,250
But he didn't have sex with you last night...

300
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,580
Well...

301
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,250
l'll never make you sad.

302
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,590
l can't believe you like an old lady like me.

303
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,460
You're better off with a pretty young girl.

304
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,360
l can't find anyone better than you!

305
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,370
l'm really serious about you.

306
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,600
Ryo-kun stop...

307
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,730
Not there. You can't put it in there today!

308
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,740
Please!

309
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,880
Okay. Then what about here?

310
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,640
What...

311
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,110
Not there!

312
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,060
lt's dirty...

313
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,260
That spot...

314
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,160
No, Ryo-kun...

315
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,570
lt hurts...

316
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,000
Ryo-kun!

317
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,000
lt's tight, Kasumi-san...

318
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,240
lt's tightening up, l've never felt this way before...

319
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,240
Ryo-kun...

320
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,340
l think l'll go insane...

321
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,080
l have to pee...

322
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,190
Kasumi-san, l can't hold it in!

323
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,020
l'm peeing!

324
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,360
There's no turning back now.

325
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,370
l can never go back.

326
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,540
lt's okay, right Ryo-kun?
