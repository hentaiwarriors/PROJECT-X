1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:15,750
Sex Demon Metropolis

2
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,670
No!

3
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,180
NO!

4
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,530
Ready to feast!

5
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,860
Stop, you low-life!

6
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,500
Demon! Wearing
the skin of a human...

7
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,900
Demons should only go screwing
around with other demons!

8
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,870
Yeah, I'm a demon.

9
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,350
So what's so bad about that?!

10
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,480
Useless...

11
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,350
I mean...

12
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,090
Oh yeah!
She's a woman.

13
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,150
Lick!

14
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,760
What?

15
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,870
It'll take 100,000 years for the Sex
Demon's goons to lick even my feet.

16
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,640
You...
You're a...

17
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,590
Yeah, the one that's come to hunt
guys like you down, a vampire.

18
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,270
As time passes, covered
by a veil of stillness...

19
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,870
The frozen area is controlled
by a sympathetic feeling.

20
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,770
The beautiful moons,
the Draculons.

21
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,750
The perishing remains
of their descendants.

22
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,190
Carrying a dark history, we return.

23
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,960
With the powers of God turning
us into the ones with wings.

24
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,670
I am Vampire Madonna.

25
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,780
Vampire Madonna Volume 01

26
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,270
These demons have been
on the move a lot recently.

27
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,930
What could they be up to?

28
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,970
Slippery, slippery, slippery.

29
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,740
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

30
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,610
What are they doing on this planet?

31
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,450
Mina, sister.

32
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,090
Aine's going to wash your back...

33
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,990
It's okay.
Just leave me alone.

34
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,560
No, you don't have to stop me...

35
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,370
It's so sensitive, as always...

36
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,440
That's not my back.

37
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,840
Who cares..?

38
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,570
S..Stop...
Stop it!

39
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,380
Ah, Anne.

40
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,450
Anne, let's play
this game together!

41
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,090
Anne, stop her...

42
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,490
Anne, so nice!

43
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,800
No, stop...

44
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,720
Anne is gone...

45
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,880
To her, it's so good...

46
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,820
This evening, a body was
discovered torn to shreds.

47
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,250
The police have reported it as...

48
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,230
This is your handiwork, sis.

49
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,270
Yeah, but from the human's point
of view, it's still a homicide case.

50
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,870
There have been a lot of
incidents involving demons lately.

51
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,370
This week alone there have
been four already. Five?!

52
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,540
All this activity by them.

53
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,340
Something smells funny...

54
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,470
This smells really nice.

55
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,080
S..S..Stop...

56
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:27,360
I haven't gotten any of
this for such a long time...

57
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,560
S..Stop! I'm right in the
middle of having my period.

58
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,930
That's why it's so good.

59
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,400
We're Draculons.
We crave blood.

60
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,670
That doesn't mean...

61
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,410
Hey, sis, you're bleeding
a lot this month.

62
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,420
It calls to our hearts.

63
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,820
Noooo...

64
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,280
Okay, we'll go out.

65
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,660
What? Going out?

66
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,630
Okay, but let me get one more lick.

67
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,530
No! Not that!

68
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,260
Yes, yes.

69
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,700
Let's go and suck...

70
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,460
F-L-E-S-H!

71
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,640
F-L-E-S-H?!

72
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,200
You ladies want blood that much?

73
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,720
The poor fate of Draculon's huh?

74
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,460
Let the powers of
darkness come inside...

75
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,320
And transform us
to our beast forms!

76
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,120
Let's go!

77
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,560
Yes!

78
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,710
Lord Karma, welcome back.

79
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,690
I have something to report,
so I waited for you.

80
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,450
What is it?

81
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,750
It's not easy for me
to say this, but...

82
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,130
I don't care.
What is it?

83
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,160
For some time now, there's been
someone interfering with our work.

84
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,000
So I thought we could get
help from you, Karma.

85
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,770
Someone's been interfering?

86
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,500
Yes.

87
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,840
If this goes on, we won't be able
to give our endorphins to you.

88
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,070
You guys are different
from the other humans.

89
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,410
I bestowed upon you powers.

90
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,210
Do you understand why?

91
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,880
Of course.
To serve Karma.

92
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,690
Yes, to serve me.

93
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,500
When humans are aroused,
the brain releases endorphins.

94
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,370
It is your job to collect them.

95
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,970
Yes, that is true...

96
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,240
Your lives are based solely
for that one purpose.

97
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,840
And if you can't
even do that for me...

98
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,350
Then you're of no use!

99
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,720
Fucking useless...

100
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,200
There's no sense for you to live
as either a man or a demon.

101
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,030
Stupid fools...

102
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,340
No one in the world
can fight against me.

103
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,450
This city will be mine to control
in only a matter of time.

104
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,580
Time!

105
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,220
I must take over
this city quickly.

106
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,120
The Sex Demon
King will do so...

107
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,610
...Women...

108
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,620
Let's have this guy tonight.

109
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,190
He looks healthy and very nice.

110
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,610
What's this? We can't get any
blood from this soft little thing.

111
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,710
Okay, let's do it!

112
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,790
Yes.

113
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,850
It's coming...
coming...coming...

114
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,550
Almost there...

115
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,270
It's so big!

116
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,660
Living blood is so good.

117
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,000
And some of this white
stuff makes it real sweet.

118
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,000
Today's meal tasted really good.

119
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,840
We should get more of his blood.

120
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,220
So sleepy.

121
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,390
Hey, Aine, what are you doing?

122
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,260
I'm going to college, of course.

123
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,270
College?

124
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,870
Yes, starting today. Aine is
going to be a college woman.

125
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,770
Why would a Draculon go
to a human university?

126
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,940
That's because I'm
old enough to go!

127
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,980
Going out looking like that...

128
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,070
You'll dry up!

129
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,080
But I want to be a college woman!

130
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,490
Don't forget that we're Draculons.

131
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,750
During the day...

132
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,920
An umbrella...

133
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,590
Yay, Anne! Nice one!

134
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,900
Hey, hey!

135
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,670
No way...

136
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,570
There are demons
roaming this city.

137
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,080
What are they thinking?

138
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,580
College women...

139
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,770
These demons must be killed, or...

140
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,030
Do you have your handkerchief?

141
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,460
Do you have your homework?

142
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,660
You're not carrying condoms
in your wallet, are you?

143
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,090
Megumi!

144
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,200
Why are you always
hanging around me?

145
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,830
What do you mean, why?

146
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,370
I'm...Tatsuo's...

147
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,200
Old Lady?

148
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,510
What?

149
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,780
Tatsuo, you're the one who
asked me out with a bloody nose!

150
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,370
That was back in elementary school!
Such a long time ago, and still...

151
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,510
Still what?

152
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,420
Now I'm going out with Kaori...

153
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,750
Kaori?! Is she your woman now?

154
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,650
Are you an idiot? She doesn't
even know that you're alive.

155
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,450
- What?!
- What?!

156
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,320
That guy...

157
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,560
Thank you so much for
the fresh blood last night.

158
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,270
Blood?

159
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,290
You didn't donate blood, did you?

160
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,430
No way.

161
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,030
We'll be attending this
university starting today.

162
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,840
What's with the umbrellas?

163
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,430
We get weak from direct sunlight.

164
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,040
Hey,just like Dracula.

165
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,740
Wow!Just like that!

166
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,750
A cross?!

167
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,020
What?

168
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,560
Of course. We're attending a
missionary-run university.

169
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,930
We have crosses and
churches everywhere.

170
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,360
Uh, hello?

171
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,220
What...What did you women do?

172
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,910
We don't like crosses.

173
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,490
Don't like...
What was that..?

174
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,490
Pro...Probably an accident.

175
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,790
Did you see it?
Their power...

176
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,260
That's bad. They
can't be normal co-eds.

177
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,960
We must report this to Lord Karma.

178
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,780
So this type of human
walks this world now, huh?

179
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,040
No, no.
They were not human.

180
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,140
Probably not...

181
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,080
They're different from you ladies.

182
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,850
As well as from any other demons
who have roamed this world.

183
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,890
Then who else could
possess such powers?

184
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,260
Maybe?!

185
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,900
No, they should all be extinct.

186
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,370
But if it is one of them...

187
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,610
And they could be the ones who've
been interfering with our plans...

188
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,180
Draculon!

189
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,680
It must be!

190
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,750
So, they are in this world.

191
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,350
That's very interesting!

192
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,460
A Draculon's endorphins!

193
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,330
Taking the vitality of a
vampire would be very nice...

194
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,760
They're not going to hunt us.

195
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,640
We are going to hunt them.

196
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,570
Lovely Kaori...
Lovely Kaori...

197
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,540
The only daughter of
the Oniyuri family...

198
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,840
And she's intelligent, with
great style and beauty...

199
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,240
Today...

200
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,980
Today I will finally express
my deep love for her...

201
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,490
When I think of you...

202
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,080
Ah,just thinking of you makes my
heart and crotch both throb hard.

203
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,750
And night after night,
my right hand...

204
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,190
Tatsuo, what is it?

205
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,360
Um..Uh..Kaori...

206
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,790
Funny meeting you in
a place like this.

207
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,800
Wanna walk home with me?
I know it's not on the way, but...

208
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,270
Sorry...

209
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,380
I have tea ceremony lessons later,
so I'm getting a ride by car.

210
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,650
I see.

211
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:42,960
And also, Tatsuo, I don't hang
around with people like you.

212
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,120
So from now on, don't
come near me again.

213
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,640
Hey! You just got dumped!

214
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,710
What is it with you women?

215
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,740
I told you Kaori was
out of your league.

216
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,610
Shut up!

217
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,510
Compared to Kaori, you're...

218
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,480
You can't look at any
other women except for me!

219
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,150
Let's go, Anne.
You can't look at any
other women except for me!

220
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,810
You can't look at any
other women except for me!

221
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,540
Why?!

222
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,880
You have me!

223
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,180
What're you? My old
lady or something?!

224
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:10,980
Yes!

225
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,420
Tatsuo.

226
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,080
Why don't you understand?

227
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,230
I love you so much.

228
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,030
Ever since we were young.

229
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,530
I've always loved you...

230
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,690
Me..Megumi?

231
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,230
But ever since college started...

232
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,100
You're always going
"Kaori, Kaori..."

233
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,040
What kind of position
are you putting me in?

234
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,800
Shut up!
Shut up!!!

235
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,740
I don't recall ever
having sex with you!

236
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,440
If you're saying that we're
together exclusively...

237
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,470
What?

238
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,780
Then start masturbating right here!

239
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,980
Masturabate?

240
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,060
Yes, masturbate!

241
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,420
Right here?

242
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:53,630
If you're the one, you should be
able to give any part of yourself to me.

243
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,700
But...

244
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,660
Hey! You're my woman, right!

245
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,030
C'mon! Start doing it!

246
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,740
Okay, I'll do it!

247
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,410
You'll do it?
Really?

248
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,440
Hey, Megumi!

249
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,510
Hey, you really don't
have to do this!

250
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:29,060
I'll show you how much
I love you, Tatsuo.

251
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,230
Show me..?

252
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,040
Please look at me...

253
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,510
Only me...
Look only at me!

254
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,280
Tatsuo..?

255
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,090
Why can't it be me, Tatsuo?

256
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,660
Me, Tatsuo...
Tatsuo...

257
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:44,730
Vampire Madonna

258
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,970
Won't forget this...

259
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,680
Yeah, like you could...

260
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,360
They're only humans...

261
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,730
Controlled by a demon's power.

262
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,960
Unless I kill the Demon Sex King
himself, more humans will be taken.

263
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,070
Where is that demon hiding?

264
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,170
What is he up to?

265
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,890
Sorry I'm late.

266
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,150
Kaori, you are very late.

267
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,630
I'm sorry.

268
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,260
It took me a long
time to get changed.

269
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,430
The only daughter of
the Oniyuri family...

270
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,470
Is it that you don't like
this tea ceremony class..?

271
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,910
- ...Or something else?
- No. Not that.

272
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,600
Just be seated.

273
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,840
Yes.

274
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,010
Everyone...

275
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,110
Time to check your crotches!

276
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,240
Yes, everyone's rope
is digging in nicely...

277
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,770
Ka..Kaori!

278
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,540
What is that?
What are you wearing?

279
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,710
Panties.

280
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,720
What's with you?

281
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,480
Wearing panties
instead of the rope?

282
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,080
S..Sorry.

283
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,980
The rope, it hurts.

284
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,180
Okay.

285
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,560
You can't follow the
instructions I give you, huh?

286
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,130
Ah, no.

287
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,460
Today's lesson is finished...

288
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,560
Everyone please go home.

289
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,200
Please excuse us.

290
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,200
Kaori, you're going to
have a special class today.

291
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,010
Y..Yes.

292
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,930
It hurts?

293
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,700
Of course it hurts.

294
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,000
It's tied very tight,
so it should hurt.

295
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,280
This is what happens when you
wear panties when you shouldn't...

296
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,650
Is it hot?

297
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,190
Of course it's hot!

298
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,950
The inside of your
panties must be burning.

299
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,260
My panties are burning hot.

300
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,970
Oh, how could I forget?

301
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,410
I forgot to stir the tea.

302
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,440
No, professor.
Please stop.

303
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,480
Stirring, stirring, stirring.

304
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,450
Stop, stop it.
Please, professor.

305
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,840
Professor, why..?

306
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,600
Why are you doing this to me?

307
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,000
Are you talking back at me?

308
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,770
No! No, but...

309
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,580
Patience is a great part
of the tea ceremony.

310
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,920
It hurts?

311
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,080
Of course it hurts.

312
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,460
If it hurts, cry, scream!

313
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,900
Then if the pain becomes pleasure,
you can cum as much as you want.

314
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,700
Then, then...

315
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:13,000
Let your love juice
flow right out of you.

316
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,640
Please stop this.

317
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,340
Don't say that.

318
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,610
For your professor...

319
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,420
Give your feelings
over to Lord Karma!

320
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,500
Wait!

321
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,700
Your smell! You've got the
demon's scent all over you...

322
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,230
Hey!

323
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,640
So, the demons got to you, huh?

324
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,280
Poor girl.

325
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,530
Tomato juice is for
people who need blood.

326
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,110
Tomato Rin Z!

327
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,240
We Draculons...

328
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,670
Yuck!

329
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,750
Hey, Megumi.

330
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,910
Oh, Aine and Anne.

331
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,550
I was looking for you guys.

332
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,920
Megumi, would you
like some tomato juice?

333
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,260
No, actually I want...

334
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,620
...something else..!

335
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,900
She's pretty weak, but
she should be alright now.

336
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,250
What caused this?

337
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,450
I don't know. We'll have
to wait a while and see.

338
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,150
Okay.

339
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,080
Doctor, do you smell something strange?

340
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,620
Huh?

341
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,250
Sorry, it's nothing.

342
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,830
Tatsuo, Kaori's been
taken to the hospital!

343
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,310
That guy...

344
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,750
Excuse me,
It's Tatsuo.

345
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,250
I've come to visit Kaori.

346
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,920
Welcome...

347
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,960
It's past visiting hours, but...

348
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,920
You're special.

349
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,360
We've been waiting for you...

350
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,560
Monsters!

351
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,190
This woman...

352
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,290
No matter what we do,
she's still all dried up.

353
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:34,140
So, we want to play with you.

354
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,080
What?!

355
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,020
Draculon! Finally,
you've shown yourself.

356
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:57,970
No matter what you do, our
plans will not be thwarted.

357
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,030
But if this is allowed to go on...

358
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,400
It will be an insult to
the Demon King's pride.

359
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,340
Lord Karma.

360
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,710
My request.

361
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,210
Don't forget it.

362
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,100
I know.

363
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:20,420
Like you, he'll become one of us.
Then let your love grow with him.

364
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:28,030
Thanks to you,
we've captured those Draculons.

365
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,740
ldiot! Watch out!

366
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,590
Sorry!

367
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,920
I'm carrying an injured person.

368
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,950
Soon we will be at Karma's.

369
00:30:59,360 --> 00:30:59,990
Wait!

370
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,530
Damn! Why do I
care about this guy?

371
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,800
lnjured, injured, injured.

372
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,710
Prepare yourself.

373
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,570
No, you prepare yourself...

374
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,070
Why don't you just die!

375
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,260
What?

376
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,560
Pesky doctor!

377
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,560
Don't get in my way!

378
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,700
No!

379
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,850
This...

380
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,350
This is...

381
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,810
The Demon Lair.

382
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,320
The Demon Lord, who turns humans'
lives inside out, lives here, huh?

383
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,400
I..I'm...
What is this..?

384
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,900
Don't worry.
I'm here with you.

385
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,170
Why are you here, Megumi?

386
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,470
What is this place?

387
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,580
This is where we're going to
make love, forever and ever...

388
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,580
I love you, Tatsuo.
I love you...

389
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,430
I know you're here.
Come out.

390
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,070
Welcome to Castle Karma!

391
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,510
I've come here to destroy you!

392
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,650
Draculon's daughter...
Why do you hunt demons?

393
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,220
There's no reason to
side with the humans.

394
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,120
I don't care about the humans.

395
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,660
The only reason I hunt demons is...

396
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,260
Because I'm a Draculon!

397
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,930
Okay.
Go ahead.

398
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,570
You'll regret going against the demons!

399
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,040
You have no more comrades.

400
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,310
Aine...

401
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,110
Anne...

402
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,180
Those Draculons' endorphins were
really tasty.

403
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,220
Those two have
no more energy left whatsoever.

404
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,760
What?!

405
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,160
Thanks to them,
I've gotten so much energy.

406
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,060
This much!
This much!

407
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,140
THlS MUCH!

408
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,940
You did that to Aine and Anne?

409
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,670
I will never forgive you!!!

410
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,210
Don't come near me!

411
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,990
I don't want any demons to love me!

412
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,720
Wait, Tatsuo!

413
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,330
You're going to get to like me.

414
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,160
Please.

415
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,130
With me.
Me.

416
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,360
Or else...

417
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,770
Weak, Draculon.

418
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:40,650
You must be stupid, trying to
hunt us with those puny powers.

419
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,040
You foolish Draculons shall perish.

420
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,210
Hiding out in the human world.

421
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,550
Now you're finished!

422
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,690
Let me go!

423
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,730
Disgusting.

424
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,800
I shall now pleasure you
beyond your wildest dreams.

425
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,200
Stop!

426
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,770
I'm still a virgin!

427
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,140
That's good.

428
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,510
A virgin's endorphins are fabulous.

429
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,680
Stop!

430
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,410
Stop it!

431
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,810
No!

432
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,120
Mina!

433
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,720
Lord Karma!

434
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:27,560
Who is it?!

435
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,500
Please, change me back
to what I was before.

436
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,100
Tatsuo called me a monster.

437
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,410
He won't love me the way I am.

438
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,750
Even if he becomes like me,
he still won't love me.

439
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,280
Quit bothering me!

440
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,820
Ta..Tatsuo...

441
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,920
I love you...

442
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,990
She interrupted us.

443
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,900
Remember this moment when you
think about losing your virginity.

444
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,270
I'm losing my viriginity
to this thing?

445
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,000
No!

446
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,040
No! No way!

447
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,680
We're here to help!

448
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,750
Anne, you're okay!

449
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,820
Uh huh!

450
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,050
Mina, it is our duty
to protect you.

451
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,390
Little pests.

452
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,330
Ouch!

453
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,420
Aine!

454
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,060
Mina! lsn't Aine good?!

455
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,760
Not good at all!

456
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,070
No! I am good!

457
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,310
Damn. We can't continue like this.

458
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,580
Yes, if I can get some blood...

459
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,750
Okay!

460
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,320
How weird.
It's you...

461
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,700
Your blood seems to give me powers.

462
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,410
W..What?!

463
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,780
Vampire!

464
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,810
If there be any law for
this land, I shall obey it...

465
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,160
Since I have no place to call home.

466
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,030
But when the moon
burns from madness...

467
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,000
When the powers come within me...

468
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,070
It will be time for you to die!

469
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,770
You talk too much!

470
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,020
Y..You...

471
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,830
It can't be...

472
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,800
Not like this...

473
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,030
Answer me!

474
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,800
What are you demons up to?!

475
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,240
Got you!

476
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:32,010
I'm going to steal your energy.

477
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,640
You're a virgin...

478
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,980
I'm going to take your virginity!

479
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,520
Stupid!

480
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,050
Sticking such a weird thing
in such a weird place!

481
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,760
Damn!

482
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,960
I made a mistake!

483
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,670
It's useless...

484
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,370
Draculon's Daughter...

485
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:04,040
The Demon Sex King's
descent is already...

486
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,860
The Demon Sex King's rule...

487
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,890
Well done, Mina.

488
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,860
What are you doing?

489
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,670
It's Megumi.

490
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,510
That stupid demon was using her.

491
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,970
That's why....
That's why...

492
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,880
Lucky! We made it in time.

493
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,290
Wasting precious energy...

494
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,150
I don't feel anything
for humans or demons.

495
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,830
That's because I'm
Vampire Madonna Mina!

496
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,530
Going to college...

497
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,230
Hey, you guys...

498
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,270
Why are you such
easygoing vampires?

499
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,300
Hey!

500
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,310
What's with those umbrellas again?
What are you guys, stupid?

501
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,410
Stop, it's so embarassing.

502
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,980
Oh! It's the woman in
the trenchcoat! Nice!

503
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,690
How about you and I having
a quickie? Just one fuck!

504
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,400
You fucking perverted sex freak!

505
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,760
Did I suck too much
blood out of him?

506
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,230
No memory of anything, huh?

507
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:35,460
Yeah, next time we'll
suck all of your blood!

508
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,410
Still, I wonder what
that demon meant...

509
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,110
The Demon Sex King's descent...
