1
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:21,760
Is it here?

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,830
Yes, Your Highness

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,260
And?

4
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,140
To welcome the guests of the state,
Prince Marlon himself...

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,630
will come part of
the way to meet you.

6
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,270
At least they don't intend
to assassinate us on the way.

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,410
Surely, however, they
have some sort of plot.

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,850
Please be careful!

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,480
We are aware of the danger,
how about the plan of yours?

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,490
Everything is in place.

11
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,890
Who's next?

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,770
What?

13
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,570
Even though it comes
from you, my Prince...

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,410
I cannot let my
younger sister take such a...

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,410
I understand your worries,
but only Hanna is capable...

16
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,110
of carrying out such a mission.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,140
B... but...

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,080
Brother.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,280
I accept this mission.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,520
What? You!

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,990
I will do anything to
be of help to the Prince.

22
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,790
You will?

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,590
Yes.
With great pleasure!

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,930
This is trouble.

25
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,380
He's always letting
those plebeians accompany him.

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,420
People think of him as
a kind of celibate, these days.

27
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,750
Daughters from all the noble
families have begun to stay away.

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,360
Yet, he doesn't seem to care,
and he isn't interested...

29
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,120
in taking a wife.

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,340
FENCER OF MINERVA
Chapter 5: The Beginning

31
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,520
Diana?
How are you doing?

32
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:22,080
Awful! It's so slow and hot.
Riding on a horse is much better.

33
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,320
You'll be alright.
You are visiting them as a Queen.

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,800
I know it's a little formal for you
but try and hang in there.

35
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes, but the truth is...
I'm scared to death.

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,010
Had I been on my own,
I'd be crying the whole way.

37
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,140
You're not alone.

38
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,110
I only hope we make
it back to Doria safely.

39
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,850
I'm back!!

40
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,580
Mr. Sho!

41
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,310
He is waiting at the inn
just a little ways ahead.

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,510
Prince Marlon?

43
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,380
Yes.

44
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,690
According to the scout,
they don't seem to be planning...

45
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,920
anything malicious.

46
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,960
Alright.

47
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,290
We ought to not keep him waiting.

48
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,360
Let's go.

49
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,020
Yes, sir!

50
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,760
Quite a show!

51
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,560
Trying to overwhelm us
from the beginning.

52
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,080
Gupta's Crown Prince Marlon
has come to welcome King Sho...

53
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,740
and Queen Diana of Doria.

54
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,280
Thank you.
It is a pleasure to meet you.

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,110
The pleasure is all mine.

56
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,720
Oh, Queen Diana,
it seems the rumor is true.

57
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,460
I wonder what rumor that is?

58
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,200
Oh, nothing your Highness.

59
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,560
We are still in the countryside.

60
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,100
There isn't much we
can offer here, so rest.

61
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,540
We'll leave for Gupta in the morning.

62
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,740
Thank you.

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,470
Please make yourselves comfortable.

64
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,220
During your stay in Gupta, she will
attend to your needs.

65
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,920
M... my name is Hanna.

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,040
Oh... she is a beautiful woman.

67
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,770
Prince Marlon, I am obliged
to your kind consideration.

68
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,180
How did you guess my taste?
Did Imil let it slip out?

69
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,940
She suits your taste?

70
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,620
Precisely, she has wonderful eyes,
shining with stubborn haughtiness.

71
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,790
Splendid!

72
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,830
It should be good fun
breaking in a woman such as this.

73
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,990
That's the true thrill of training a slave.
Don't you agree, Prince Marlon?

74
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,690
Ah... well... As you say.

75
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,500
The bad habit of
Your Highness, again.

76
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,270
He's always like this.

77
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,170
As soon as he sees a beautiful,
brave looking woman, he loses himself.

78
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,250
I apologize for his rudeness towards
such a valuable slave of Gupta.

79
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,590
Please, it's no bother!!
It is my duty to entertain our guests.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,190
I am delighted to know she has won
the favor of His Highness.

81
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,820
Attend to their every wish.

82
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:54,830
Yes, sir!

83
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,030
Good night.

84
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:07,540
Hanna, could you tell our orderlies
outside to bring in our luggage?

85
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,540
Yes, Your Highness.

86
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,440
Sho.

87
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,710
She's not a slave.

88
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,320
I didn't think so, either.

89
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,620
That body...

90
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,050
What were you looking at?

91
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,520
Don't misunderstand.

92
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,000
Those toned muscles
indicate she is a good fencer.

93
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,730
Oh? Then you think she'll...

94
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,400
No, she won't come
in for any rough play.

95
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,200
She's most likely a spy.

96
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,040
Did you notice the way
she looks at the Prince?

97
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,070
Yes.

98
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,010
But, I don't believe
Marlon is interested in her.

99
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,610
Dee, keep out of that matter.
We're not on vacation here.

100
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,880
But, I feel a little sorry for her.

101
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,710
Women...

102
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:04,430
The King is such a ladies' man.
How can the Queen take it?

103
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,310
That's an attractive woman?

104
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,620
Oh, you're not going
to take your clothes off?

105
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,460
What?

106
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,620
I wonder if the customs
are different here in Gupta?

107
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,120
Is it that Guptans change
clothes many times a day?

108
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,290
No, we don't, but...

109
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,390
What are you embarrassed about?

110
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,960
You'll get soaked.
Why don't you take them off.

111
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,130
A... alright...

112
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,210
Such a beautiful body.

113
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,640
No, you're the one
with the body.

114
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,550
Thanks for the flattery.

115
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,090
No, really.
Let me scrub your back.

116
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,620
Thank you.

117
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,200
Hanna, has Prince Marlon
used you yet?

118
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,180
I... I'm not...

119
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,010
To begin with, Prince Marlon doesn't
let women get too close to him.

120
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,680
Really?

121
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,080
You never know what men
are doing behind your back.

122
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,590
If you keep acting so innocent,
my King may take advantage of you...

123
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,960
even before your Prince.

124
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,220
Oh, don't tell me
you are still a virgin.

125
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,360
N... no!

126
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,030
I suppose not.

127
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,530
No man could overlook
such an attractive body.

128
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,800
Your Highness, what are you?

129
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,030
Shhhh!
King Sho will come in if he hears us.

130
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,710
Is that what you want?

131
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,140
Would you like to be taken
right before my eyes?

132
00:08:53,650 --> 00:09:00,380
N... no... Please spare me...
No... Your Highness...

133
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,400
Cruel Queen!

134
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,390
It's a punishment for your lie.

135
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,230
My lie?

136
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,460
Yes... a big lie...

137
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,800
N, no...

138
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,070
Say it!

139
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,570
You want to be
used by Prince Marlon!!

140
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,570
Yes, I'll say it, please!

141
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,580
I... I want Prince Marlon to...

142
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,930
Wha... what?
You are going on horseback?

143
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,760
Yes, I'm tired of being in the carriage.
It's too slow and too hot.

144
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,370
Besides, King Gauss
is waiting for us.

145
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,310
B, but...

146
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,600
Diana is used to riding horses
since she was a child.

147
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,450
She wishes to see the riding
techniques of Guptan cavalrymen...

148
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,110
which are highly
spoken of in our land.

149
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,320
I would love to see them myself.

150
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:12,960
I see.

151
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,020
However, if she falls behind...

152
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,030
If that happens,
I'll wait for the carriage to get me.

153
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,790
Well, then!

154
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,330
Let them see the real worth
of the Guptan Cavalry Division!

155
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,480
Fine. Tell the infantry to follow.
Let's have some fun!!

156
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,300
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,410
Returning to Gupta!!
Double file, gallop!

158
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,190
Proceed!!

159
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,660
Alright, let's go!!

160
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,630
Everybody is gone

161
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,250
Just as we planned.

162
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,310
True...

163
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,610
Hanna, you are very good.

164
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,250
You too, Your Highness.

165
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,180
Queen Diana is keeping up with us!

166
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,760
I can't believe it.

167
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,360
Your Highness,
are you all right?

168
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,560
Wonderful!

169
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,700
Just as I would of expected
of the Guptan Cavalry Division.

170
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,030
Yes, it is our pride.

171
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,100
Prince Marlon, how much farther?

172
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,550
The steeple that's just
coming into our view is Gupta.

173
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,950
Then, should you not
have them form in file?

174
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,560
How shameful of them!!

175
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,250
Wow!
That Queen came on horseback?

176
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,250
Geeez!

177
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,250
I wish Gupta had a woman
like that for Prince Marlon.

178
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:26,030
You'd have to be a nomad
to keep up with the Gupta cavalry.

179
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,590
How fearless,
challenging my cavalry.

180
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,600
No matter what she's up to,
I won't be taken with such a bluff.

181
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,260
Little wench!

182
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,950
Hey!
Where are you going?

183
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,590
I didn't think you'd
made it this far, Mr. Imil.

184
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,220
I was too worried
for the King and Queen.

185
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,620
How 's it going?

186
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,530
No worries!

187
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,360
As you expected,
all the Guptan soldiers...

188
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,170
went chasing after the
pretty little ass of the Queen.

189
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,200
The what?

190
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:24,280
I got a kick... out of her being
whipped stark naked before.

191
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,310
H... how impudent!!

192
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,880
It was a long time ago.

193
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,660
So, there are no Guptan soldiers?

194
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,530
None on this road!

195
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,990
Just as Doria was a long time ago,
Gupta has also been spoiled by...

196
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,570
these ten years of peace.

197
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,370
Precisely, Mr. Seneca!

198
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,300
Now, we will await
the signal from King Sho.

199
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,580
Alright, everybody!
Let's get going!!

200
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,850
Yeah!!

201
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,020
We should get ready, too.

202
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:21,210
Their Highnesses,
King Sho and Queen Diana!!

203
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,380
How splendid!

204
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,120
Splendid!

205
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,720
Oh...

206
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,890
Oh, that's the shrew who lead
our cavalry by the nose?

207
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,600
Yes...

208
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,060
It's hard to believe
just by looking at her.

209
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,960
If you knew how to
handle women a little better...

210
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,410
you wouldn't have
made a fool of yourself.

211
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,410
I am ashamed, Sire.

212
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,920
The Dorian King is paying
homage to our King!

213
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,760
What is he thinking?

214
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,320
Wh... what is?

215
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,770
Your Highness King Gauss!!
I am Sho, the new King of Doria.

216
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,400
This is my Queen, Diana.

217
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,440
Though I am inexperienced,
I have succeeded the throne of Doria.

218
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,740
I come here today to humbly
Salute Your Highness...

219
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,770
the Conqueror of the North.

220
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,720
Such dignity despite his age!

221
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,120
I have never seen
such a gallant king before.

222
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,330
That is the son
of the late King Bassen.

223
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,760
Nonetheless, the Queen
is the daughter of the one...

224
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,790
who murdered his father.

225
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,800
How can he?

226
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,930
No, no, they make
a wonderful young couple.

227
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,970
Such a courteous greeting,
I, King Gauss, am impressed.

228
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,150
Let us both prosper
as good neighbors!

229
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,110
Forever and after!

230
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,320
To Gupta's prosperity!!

231
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,160
To Doria's prosperity!!

232
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,090
To the friendship
of Doria and Gupta!!

233
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,660
Toast!!

234
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,280
Who is she?

235
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,690
There shouldn't be any new slaves
here on an occasion such as this.

236
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,690
I haven't seen her before.

237
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,690
She belongs to the Cavalry Division.

238
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,690
What, that's Hanna?

239
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,350
Yes.

240
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,500
Why is the only woman
in our glorious Cavalry Division...

241
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,970
disguised as a slave?

242
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,200
To spy on the King
and Queen of Doria.

243
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,700
A spy?

244
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,900
Coming from you,
it's not a bad idea.

245
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,210
So beautiful, I thought
perhaps she was your lover.

246
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,720
F... father!!
She's practically half man.

247
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,120
Not at all.

248
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,050
Without knowledge
of her true identity...

249
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,890
you'd never know
it was the fierce Hanna.

250
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,150
Look at the feminine shyness.

251
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,330
Through her disguise, her
body exposed in that slave's outfit.

252
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,000
It brings out the woman in her.

253
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,570
Woman...

254
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,510
Oh, well I'm not cut out for this.

255
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,750
Neither am I.

256
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,350
I wish I could strangle the
man who tried to assassinate Teo!!

257
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,890
What's wrong?

258
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,400
N... no, nothing!

259
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,430
She must know something.

260
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,590
So it seems.

261
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,330
But, I must thank the man
who attacked King Teo.

262
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,070
Come now, you shouldn't say that.
He's still in bed, suffering.

263
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,910
But, for him, my life-long dream
to become a queen came true.

264
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,780
Otherwise, I would still
be your slave.

265
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,380
Slave...?

266
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,780
You are diverting
from our plan.

267
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,020
Leave it to me.

268
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,950
Hanna where's our wine?

269
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,490
Y... yes, coming!

270
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,960
Sorry to keep you waiting!?

271
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,980
Master...
Oh, Hanna, thank you.

272
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,980
I will pour some.

273
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,840
Thanks.

274
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,450
What's wrong?
Why are you trembling?

275
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,150
I... I'm sorry.

276
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,620
Have some with us.

277
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,420
N... no, I shouldn't.

278
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,660
That's OK.
It's an order.

279
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes...

280
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,660
I'll pour some for you.

281
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,660
Thank you.

282
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,670
Why don't you empty it.

283
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,670
Good job.
Have another.

284
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,520
Are the soldiers ready?

285
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,520
Yes, Sire.

286
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,370
They won't leave here alive.

287
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,720
Oh my!
Then, you really were a slave.

288
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,960
An excellent one, I was
priced for more than 100 gold coins.

289
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,860
100 gold coins?
So much?

290
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,890
But, he would never sell me.

291
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,060
Right?

292
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,240
Of course not.

293
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:31,900
Master... Master, please
enjoy your poor slave.

294
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,250
Am I not beautiful enough?

295
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,250
You are beautiful.

296
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:51,430
Then... Master, please
use me as you used to.

297
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,610
Excuse me...

298
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,950
Hey, you are overdoing it.

299
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,820
But, I'm so turned on...

300
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,130
She's listening.

301
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,590
All the more reason.

302
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,840
Master, please... Yes...

303
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,480
Yes!

304
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,910
Queen...
That's so cruel!

305
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,480
N... no, please spare me...

306
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,250
No... Diana!

307
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,890
Master...

308
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,770
Your Highness, please...

309
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,680
Can't help it!

310
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,930
I am... a proud Guptan soldier!

311
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,890
Such terrible behavior, it can't be...

312
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,870
Prince... Marlon!

313
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,910
What!?
They told you this?

314
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,580
Yes...

315
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,020
It doesn't make sense.

316
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,650
Why would they tell
something like that to a slave?

317
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,750
I am not a slave!

318
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,560
I didn't mean...

319
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,630
Well, at any rate, they seem
to trust you completely.

320
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,940
Keep up the good work.

321
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,810
Y... yes...

322
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,890
In our kingdom, the soldiers
receive training every day.

323
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,600
Superb, what do you think, Diana?

324
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,530
Yes... But...

325
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,610
What is it?
Please be frank.

326
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,430
Then I shall.

327
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,240
The way they are being trained
wouldn't be of any use in real battle.

328
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,840
What!!

329
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,970
What!?
That's too much!

330
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,510
Such slander cannot be taken
even from the Queen of Doria!

331
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,580
That's very harsh.

332
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,990
I hear you are a good fencer,
yourself, Your Highness.

333
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,130
At least, a little better
than your men.

334
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,960
But, we cannot ask the Queen
of Doria for a fencing match.

335
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,740
Come now, Diana.

336
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,670
You are no longer
a tomboyish little Princess.

337
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,770
Well... Prince Marlon, how about him?

338
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:31,010
Could she know my brother
is the one who attacked Teo?

339
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,040
What about him?

340
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,480
He's probably as good as myself.
It'll be good practice.

341
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,480
Please don't, Your Highness!!

342
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,360
Why?

343
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,060
You could get hurt.

344
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,360
Don't worry.

345
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,830
They have protective gear
for women, don't they?

346
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,070
What!?

347
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,890
Before becoming a slave,
you were trained as a fencer.

348
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,970
I can tell from the way you move.
What do you say we have a match?

349
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,580
Well... that's...

350
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,140
How about it, Prince Marlon?

351
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,040
If you insist,
Hanna, do as they wish.

352
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,990
Y... yes...

353
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,260
Hey, Hanna.
Why don't you say we make a deal.

354
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,360
Loser does one thing the winner
requests, whatever it may be.

355
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,370
Are you sure?
It works for me.

356
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,640
If you don't give it all you've got,
you might get hurt.

357
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,100
I know.

358
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,210
Begin!

359
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,840
You're pretty good.

360
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,080
So are you.

361
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,530
Right there, Hanna!
What are you doing!?

362
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,690
Oh, um, excuse me.

363
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,730
They're both very good.

364
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,800
It's no wonder
you've become so heated.

365
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,030
Sorry.

366
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,640
Does Hanna belong to you?

367
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,580
Huh?

368
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:12,050
An ordinary man would
not be able to tame her.

369
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,510
N... no.

370
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,880
That's a shame.

371
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,750
With a little more
experience as a woman...

372
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,920
Diana wouldn't compare to her.

373
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,060
Hanna, what's wrong?

374
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,330
You've never had problems,
even against men.

375
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,300
Why now?

376
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,600
I'd never imagined the petite Diana
could be such a great fighter!

377
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,850
Got you!

378
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,720
I... I give up!

379
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,900
Now that's what you
call a practice match!!

380
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,400
True!

381
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,140
That's how a Guptan
soldier ought to be!!

382
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,330
Great!

383
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,710
An amazing display!

384
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,470
Great!

385
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,910
Here.

386
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,840
Thank you.

387
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,510
Where did you learn
such a technique?

388
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:23,750
My King taught me.
Well, a deal's a deal.

389
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,320
Yes, anything you say.

390
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,120
OK, then...

391
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,460
What!?

392
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,560
What did she say to Hanna?

393
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,500
I don't know.

394
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,670
You were very impressive,
Your Highness!!

395
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,930
Hanna, you did a good job, too.

396
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,200
Thank you, Prince Marlon...

397
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,380
Prince, Hanna has
something to ask you.

398
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,840
Hanna!

399
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,350
Pr... Prince Marlon...

400
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,140
Tell me.

401
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,950
You performed superbly.
I'll grant you anything as reward.

402
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,560
Please make me yours...

403
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,690
What?

404
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,020
You have to articulate
exactly what you want!!

405
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,670
Please have me!!

406
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,970
What!?

407
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,130
Are you out of your mind!?

408
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,810
Dressing as a slave made
your heart a slave as well?!

409
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,250
I will kill you here!

410
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,110
Stop it!!

411
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,680
You are in the presence
of the King of Doria!!

412
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,210
I'm sorry for my
disgraceful behavior.

413
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,320
Forgive me, brother.
I am in love with Prince Marlon.

414
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,660
If I can be by his side,
I do not mind being a slave!!

415
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:43,070
Please, Prince Marlon.
Please accept me...

416
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,210
Prince, what are you
going to do with Hanna?

417
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,940
Will you execute her for
failing her mission as a spy?

418
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,040
No, I will not.

419
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,520
She already reported to you
about our circumstances.

420
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,960
That was true, then?

421
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,790
Diana discovered her true self
only when she became a slave.

422
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,260
Probably, it was
the same for Hanna.

423
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,790
Sometimes, high standing prevents you
from being honest with yourself.

424
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,610
I suggest you keep her
as a slave for a while.

425
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,570
After that, it's up to you.

426
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,450
Thank you for your advice.
Hanna, are you content with that?

427
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,780
Yes, as long as I am by your side.

428
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,820
Now, we have to deal
with the real problem.

429
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,040
You asked for a private meeting.
I can only wonder what it's about.

430
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,980
My, my. Since the day
you two arrived in Gupta...

431
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,640
our kingdom has witnessed
unprecedented incidents...

432
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,810
one after the other.

433
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,380
I apologize.

434
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,120
Please consider them accidents
caused by the thoughtless behavior...

435
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,090
of the young...

436
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,920
No, I won't.

437
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,510
Why don't we hear
your true intentions?

438
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:17,320
Under the disguise of courtesy,
you humiliated the best of my people...

439
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,500
took advantage of my son's schemes,
and compelled him to take a woman.

440
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,830
Why!?

441
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,770
Indeed we have our own purpose!

442
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,270
Oh, and what could that be?

443
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,050
To find the man who tried
to assassinate King Teo...

444
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,280
and seek out the puppet master.

445
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,050
Then execute both of them!!

446
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,120
What!!

447
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,790
That's funny.
And, you think we did it, don't you?

448
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,650
On what grounds?

449
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,790
Such knives are numerous.

450
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,460
Really?

451
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,540
Unlike Doria, where soldiers
procure their own weapons...

452
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,040
all the equipment here is provided
by the state of Gupta.

453
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,510
Is it not so?

454
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,410
And this, an official knife
of a Guptan soldier!!

455
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,550
Furthermore!!

456
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,060
According to our Swordsmith,
this crest is not a part...

457
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,250
of the original design.

458
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,760
Most likely, the owner of
this knife had it inscribed.

459
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,790
Someone whose family
crest was the same as this one.

460
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,100
I saw a soldier who had
the same crest on his armor...

461
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,730
at the parade ground!!

462
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,770
Even if there was a soldier whose
family crest was the same as this...

463
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,070
someone might have
stolen this knife from him.

464
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,810
It was stolen?

465
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,410
How shameful for him,
being a Guptan soldier.

466
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,470
However, we could let it go.

467
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,750
Teo has passed the crisis.
His complete recovery is not far off.

468
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,960
If we keep taking revenge on each
other, it will soon lead to war.

469
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,700
Don't you agree?

470
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,200
Diana.

471
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,570
Yes, Your Highness!!

472
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,990
The signal! Hurry!

473
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,890
The signal! All right!

474
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,490
The signal!

475
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,260
Yes!

476
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,120
Let's go!!

477
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,100
Yeah!!

478
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,340
There it is! Move out!

479
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,640
Go!

480
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,370
Go!

481
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,140
Go!

482
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,040
Go!

483
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,810
What is this?

484
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,390
The knife passed along
through the Dorian Royal Family.

485
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,530
I killed Prince Dunan
with that knife.

486
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,180
What!?

487
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,950
What did you say!?

488
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,970
Prince Dunan sexually assaulted me
in front of my servants and his men...

489
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,830
despite the fact that I was already Sho's.

490
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,340
I stabbed him to death.

491
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,670
You!!

492
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,310
If you're going to interfere,
I will kill you, too!!

493
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,270
Like father, like son!

494
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,180
If that's what you want, then it'll
be my pleasure to take you on!

495
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,550
Such impudence!!

496
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,820
Little bastard!!

497
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:46,730
King Gauss, you couldn't imagine how
terribly your son humiliated Diana!!

498
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,480
However, there is no gain in hating
each other for the things of the past!

499
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,010
Hate only bears more hate!

500
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,540
It can only cause
trouble for both nations!

501
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,480
What do you say, Gauss?

502
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,620
An enemy attack!!
We are being attacked!!

503
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,790
Wh... what's this!?

504
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:15,800
What!!

505
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,010
Help!!

506
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,420
Sho's doing a good job.

507
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,260
How?

508
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,570
Your Highness!!
Gupta is completely surrounded!!

509
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,430
What!!

510
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,080
There are many thousands, no,
hundreds of thousands of soldiers!!

511
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,140
No country has such a large military!!

512
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,750
Yes, we do.

513
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,950
A military force which
does not wish to wage war.

514
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,820
Unbelievable!

515
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,210
Where did they come from?

516
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,660
Ah, we can't tell!

517
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:18,700
Official Dorian soldiers, and nearly
a hundred thousand nomads.

518
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,090
Nomads?

519
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,700
I am the Chief of the chiefs,
who binds entire nomad populations.

520
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,710
Your Highness!!

521
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,220
The Chairman of the Saas Council
and a man who claims to be...

522
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,740
the Dorian Royal Adviser are here!!

523
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,520
There they are.

524
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,150
I am telling you,
Your Highness, King Gauss...

525
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,260
we do not intend to attack Gupta.

526
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:51,850
However, if you refuse to surrender,
we will continue the siege.

527
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,860
The Saas are
completely supporting us.

528
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,830
As long as you resist,
none of the goods from Saas...

529
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,200
not a piece of bread,
will come to Gupta.

530
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,970
The Chairman of the Saas Council
is here to inform you of that.

531
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,340
What?

532
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,510
Gupta loses without a fight...

533
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,350
a kingdom which is
revered for its valor.

534
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,280
Father!!

535
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,450
One more thing!!

536
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,390
We will not occupy Gupta.

537
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,750
What!?

538
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,950
If you surrender,
I guarantee the autonomy of Gupta...

539
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,530
as well as your status.

540
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,720
Why would you
guarantee such a thing?

541
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,230
I do not wish
to hurt innocent citizens.

542
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,000
Then why did you
send in such a huge force?

543
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,480
To protect my Queen, Diana!

544
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,340
Your Highness!

545
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,010
Thank God, you are safe.

546
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,550
He is a great man.
Well, the rest is up to us.

547
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,520
Yeah, I guess you're right.

548
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,790
I have one more
important task as well.

549
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,700
Who is it?

550
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,180
It's Diana, Prince Marlon.

551
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,250
Queen Diana?

552
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,520
Th... this is...!?

553
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:31,390
I heard you stayed up all night
working on the new treaty...

554
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,460
between Doria and Gupta.

555
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,460
You must be tired.

556
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,630
Ah, well...

557
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,230
Hanna, comfort Prince Marlon.

558
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,700
Y... yes...

559
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,670
So long.

560
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,850
I give up!
I can't outdo her no matter what.

561
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,060
Or rather, I can't outdo those two.

562
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,520
King Sho told me something.

563
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,930
He said it was something
the late King Bassen told him once.

564
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,330
What did he say?

565
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,470
Make a slave of the
woman you love most.

566
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,570
Very true!

567
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,970
Prince Marlon...

568
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,810
Address me correctly.

569
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,010
Well?

570
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,850
M... Master...

571
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:26,850
And?

572
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:31,380
Would you please...
please accept my obedience?

573
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,520
Of course.

574
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,990
Please... Master, use me.

575
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,790
Is that what you want?

576
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,090
Yes, I have been waiting
for such a long time.

577
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,510
Master... am I not beautiful enough?

578
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,820
You are beautiful.

579
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,390
Please! Take me!

580
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,660
M... my body is...
aching for you, Master.

581
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,730
I am already so...

582
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,570
Hanna...

583
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,870
I'm embarrassed.

584
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,880
Yes, please...

585
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,710
Who did you learn this from?

586
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,020
Queen Diana...

587
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,550
M... Master...

588
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,160
Hanna...

589
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,290
Forgive me, Master...
I cannot wait any longer!

590
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,370
Please let me have it... please!

591
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,830
Ah... yeah...

592
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,970
Are you OK, Hanna?

593
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,110
Yes...

594
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,080
Hanna...

595
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,750
My... Master...

596
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,720
Are you happy?

597
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,430
Y... yes...

598
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,890
You have become very honest.

599
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,760
I shall punish you
for your past dishonesty.

600
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,040
As you wish.

601
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,540
Master... more!

602
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,650
Please, punish me more!

603
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,660
It's so good!

604
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,200
Then, I will leave the rest to you.

605
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,200
You really must go?

606
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,010
Yes.

607
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,030
My duties are complete.

608
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,150
Ulsra wants to ride
with me in the field.

609
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,410
She's sure to be upset
if I keep you here any longer.

610
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,810
Promise me you'll stop by
when you are near.

611
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,720
I will, as long as
you are in Doria.

612
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,890
Mr. Sho.

613
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,690
So, you definitely
won't take it back.

614
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,390
No.

615
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,230
You are going to need
it now more than ever.

616
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,330
I have my own clan and Ulsra.
That's enough for me.

617
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,700
I see... Well then...

618
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,170
Take care of Diana.

619
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,730
Queen Diana.
Are you really content like that?

620
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,400
Yes, Mr. Teo.

621
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,070
I see...

622
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,580
I should've made you
my slave when I had the chance.

623
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,150
I never imagined you'd make
such a great servant.

624
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,050
Mr. Teo, Ulsra is getting jealous.

625
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,730
Have a lot of children.

626
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,660
We will!!

627
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,400
On her own free will, Queen Diana
took back her status as a slave.

628
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,470
Diana, who chose a new way of life,
became idolized among the women...

629
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,070
of this world.

630
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,750
The legend tells us that she
came to be known as...

631
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:57,050
"Diana the Slave-Queen",
and was admired long after.

632
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:18,070
In a pair of yearning eyes
I fall into a dream

633
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:31,720
and again the hard
wind blows in.

634
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:48,460
Turning back the long
way I have come

635
00:43:50,110 --> 00:44:01,820
the shadows of flowers
are swaying in the wind.

636
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:23,570
In the sky
a bird cries out

637
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:46,790
Although the pain in my
heart brings me down

638
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:52,960
with you

639
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:03,110
someday

640
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:09,310
someday

641
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:28,200
I hope that our fates will
meet on top of the hill.
