1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Kigurumi Sentai Kiltean

2
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,250
All right, let's begin.

3
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,210
High dimension scanner initiated.

4
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,960
Locked on to target coordinates.

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,300
Start scanning!

6
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,400
Polyester Private Academy...

7
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,530
So she's here, huh?

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,780
I've found you, Tenjikudo Aya-san.

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,750
Episode 1
Transform! Kilteans!?

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,050
Episode 1
Invaders in a peaceful school!

11
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,050
Episode 1
An evil team attacks the beautiful sisters!

12
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,810
Y-You got me!

13
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,740
Are you serious?

14
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,660
You only have a week until the tournament.

15
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,990
You need to try harder!

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,200
Okay, next!

17
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,210
All right, I'll go next.

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,060
Sarasa, it's about time to go to the next club.

19
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,440
Oh, is it? Hold on a sec!

20
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,490
Let's go!

21
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,320
Are they...

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,330
Huh? What's the matter, guys?

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,120
You should go a little easy on them.

24
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,920
Our motto here at Polyester Academy is,

25
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,170
"Encourage students to excel both academically and athletically."

26
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,300
All the clubs are training hard for the summer tournaments.

27
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,850
Yeah, I can tell.

28
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,480
Oh yeah, there's another club in need of your help.

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
What's the schedule like?

30
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,610
It looks a little tight.

31
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,740
I can tell.

32
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,570
Which club is it?

33
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,740
The basketball club.

34
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,200
Really? That means...

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,910
Yep. Captain Kaga-senpai wants to talk to you about it.

36
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,000
Oh, my God! I'm gonna go shower right now!

37
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,000
I've got to do this.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,290
Please fit it into the schedule.

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,760
Okay.

40
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,630
She's going to the shower room like that, huh?

41
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm sure she won't notice that until she's back here.

42
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,300
Rina?

43
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,720
Yes?

44
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,730
Isn't that Sarasa running half-naked down the hallway like an idiot?

45
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,440
Yup.

46
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,350
How embarrassing.

47
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,770
She's my older sister, even though she was born just thirty minutes before me.

48
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,030
Are you going to your club, Mayura?

49
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,820
Yup.

50
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,910
You'd better stop putting on airs, at least when you're wearing a white coat.

51
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,040
Girls should always be well-dressed and well-groomed.

52
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,300
Besides, a white coat is the uniform for people who love science and truth.

53
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,640
Right there.

54
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,860
Nice shot, Captain.

55
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,610
Kaga-senpai!

56
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,200
I've brought Sarasa!

57
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,990
Thank you for making time.

58
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,160
No problem at all.

59
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,040
The star shooter for the girls team is hurt.

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,370
So I was wondering if you could be her replacement.

61
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,380
I know all the clubs are busy working towards their tournaments,

62
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,670
but is there any way you can help me out?

63
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,880
Sure! I'll do my best, Senpai!

64
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,130
Thank you.

65
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,140
It's time for me to go to the Student Council meeting.

66
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,100
I know Tenjikudo Mayura as one of the members of the Book Committee.

67
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,980
She's my younger sister. We're twins.

68
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,900
Research Club for Chemical Experimentation
Club President: Tenjikudo Mayura

69
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,360
So what do you want?

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,860
Sorry for calling you in here.

71
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,240
If you're looking for more money to fund experiments or new drugs,

72
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,080
I can't help you there.

73
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,540
I'm just a science teacher.

74
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,290
I'm sad that you think I called you here for that.

75
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,130
T-Tenjikudo-kun...

76
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,550
Please call me Mayura.

77
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,840
Wh-What are you doing?

78
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,510
I've been in love with you for a long time.

79
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,650
You're beautiful, Mayura.

80
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,730
Wait.

81
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,360
Here. This is a special one that I made with jelly.

82
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,530
How is it special?

83
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,070
This condom will allow you to stay hard longer and feel more pleasure.

84
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,450
Let me put it on for you.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,260
M-Mayura-kun, do you always do things like this?

86
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,590
I only do this for people I like.

87
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,110
Sensei... Sayama-sensei, please...

88
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,160
I need some more drugs for my experiments.

89
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,660
So could you help me on that?

90
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,910
Don't worry about it.

91
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,250
Really? You're so nice!

92
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,170
Please stay there like that.

93
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,030
Mama? Is everyone okay?

94
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,280
They're bruised all over.

95
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,990
It'll take ten to twenty days for them to recover.

96
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,120
How many people are you going to put in here before the tournament?

97
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,540
I wouldn't tell you to be just like Mayura,

98
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,420
but why don't you behave more like a girl?

99
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,550
I'm sure you have someone you like.

100
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,130
Don't you?

101
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,010
Perhaps one of these guys?

102
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,140
Of course not.

103
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,010
There's a huge difference between these guys and Kaga-senpai.

104
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,310
President of the Student Council

105
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,730
and Captain of the Basketball Club, Kaga Inari, huh?

106
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,190
Not bad.

107
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,060
I get that you like him,

108
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,980
but I don't understand why Mayura likes that kind of guy too.

109
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,070
Wait a second.

110
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,860
What do you mean?

111
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,070
Hey, did you see that?

112
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,830
What?

113
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,330
The pheromones from my body seem to be spreading in this room.

114
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,880
Everyone is injured, but they'll be fine.

115
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,920
I'm going to take a shower.

116
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,060
So as the leader of the Discipline Committee suggested,

117
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,980
in order to create good memories during this summer break, students should...

118
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,450
<i>He excels at both sports and school work.</i>

119
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,240
<i>One of the top students in the history of Polyester Academy.</i>

120
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,790
<i>The invincible president of the Student Council.</i>

121
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,040
<i>In addition, he's got the looks.</i>

122
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,420
<i>Despite all that, he's not involved in a relationship with any particular girl.</i>

123
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,760
<i>He's not even affected by the powerful pheromone I inherited from my mother.</i>

124
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,340
<i>Senpai is so cool.</i>

125
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,760
<i>Please wait for me.</i>

126
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,010
<i>Mayura-kun?
I'm going to be a more attractive woman,</i>

127
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,010
<i>Library Club President, Tenjikudo Mayura-kun?
I'm going to be a more attractive woman,</i>

128
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,600
<i>Library Club President, Tenjikudo Mayura-kun?
and in this campus...</i>

129
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,100
Y-Yes! I will do my best, Senpai!

130
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,560
Th-Thank you...

131
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,990
Now excuse me, everyone. Something just came up.

132
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,860
Let's discuss the other agenda items next time.

133
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,610
See you.

134
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,130
Aya-san...

135
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,180
I don't care that you're married or the mother of my schoolmates.

136
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,310
I... I...

137
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,150
I feel like I'm being watched.

138
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,160
What? What happened?

139
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,830
I was almost there.

140
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,710
What's wrong?

141
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,470
Kyomoto-sama, fixation of the portal from different space has been completed.

142
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,680
Okay.

143
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,940
The Toidora Fortress now floats into normal space.

144
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,620
It's coming from outside!

145
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,660
Shit! It's not opening.

146
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,370
I'm afraid of dark, cramped spaces!

147
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,920
There's no time for this.

148
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,630
I'll fix the monitor first so I can finish what I started.

149
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,900
What's that?

150
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,960
Sarasa?

151
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,010
It stopped.

152
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,450
At last, it's time for Toidora to take its first steps towards world conquest.

153
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,830
Ribbon Dora.

154
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:24,960
Yes.

155
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,130
Doll Dora.

156
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,130
Yes.

157
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,320
What is this?

158
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
It's kinda amazing, isn't it?

159
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,830
It's a nice day today.

160
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,750
Let me start over.

161
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,460
It's sunny today.

162
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,080
No, I mean...

163
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,830
What did he say?
No, I mean...

164
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,460
It must be some kind of public relations stunt.

165
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,880
They would do so much for that?

166
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,800
What else could it be?

167
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,260
You think they're an evil cabal that has a scheme to take over the world?

168
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,840
That's right!

169
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,350
You see, ladies...

170
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:26,350
We will use perfect science to lead humans towards the new century.

171
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,980
And to do that,

172
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:35,070
we'll give some tough-love lessons to the people who play with scientific technologies.

173
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,860
That's the reason we are here.

174
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,910
Now it should...

175
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,700
Damn! Aya-san has left already.

176
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,270
What?

177
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,420
Remember that in the past, we used to have clear blue skies.

178
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,420
We longed for the vast universe

179
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,180
and believed in the infinite possibilities of scientific technology.

180
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,600
[Environmental destruction, over-population, north-south issues, economic disparity...]

181
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,190
[The problems we have on this planet this century are...]

182
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,730
They got heatstroke?
[The problems we have on this planet this century are...]

183
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,230
Well, they're just part-time workers after all.
[The problems we have on this planet this century are...]

184
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,940
This is what he gets for being cheap.
[The problems we have on this planet this century are...]

185
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,570
Now it is time for us to rise and...

186
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,280
Kyomoto-sama!

187
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,200
Have you forgotten why we're here?

188
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,700
Dr. Tenjikudo is here at this academy.

189
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,330
— Yes, the reason why we are here is...

190
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,000
— I get it already.
— Yes, the reason why we are here is...

191
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,420
You guys are too noisy.

192
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,470
There you are, Aya-san.

193
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,180
You look even more beautiful than the last time I saw you.

194
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,600
Anyway, we...

195
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,600
"We want you to work with us," huh?

196
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,520
Exactly, Aya-san.

197
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,610
You've been babbling about this for a long time.

198
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,700
Don't tell me you think you can conquer the world?

199
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,290
With you ugly androids, useless soldiers,

200
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,910
insanely big aircraft, and infantile technology...

201
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,130
No, if you think that's still possible, I'll just laugh.

202
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,300
You've...

203
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,760
You've said enough!

204
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,930
Rise, tin soldiers!

205
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,760
Get that woman at any cost!

206
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,310
Very well.

207
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,770
If you defeat me in this battle, I'll be yours.

208
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,400
Battle?

209
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,350
That's right.

210
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,900
I thought something like this might happen,

211
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,690
so I created these power suits, the Kilteans, with my husband.

212
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,780
Hey, Mom?

213
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,780
What are you doing up there?

214
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,580
Who are those people?

215
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,290
Well, well, so you are Tenjikudo Sarasa-san and Mayura-san.

216
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,750
I'm Kyomoto Yuzan.

217
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,340
I've known your mother for a long time.

218
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,500
I got it!

219
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,170
Based on my experience, he's a faggot!

220
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,050
Oh, is he?

221
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,590
He isn't!

222
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,720
Like mother, like daughters!

223
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,310
Tin soldiers! Capture them all!

224
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:22,490
Now, girls, if you don't give it your best shot, Mommy will get taken away.

225
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,240
And if I were to help them conquer the world,

226
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,540
it would only take three years to do that, and Japan would only take a month.

227
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,250
Huh?

228
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,830
How can you be so proud of that?

229
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,460
All right, we'll do best.

230
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,590
Even if you say that...

231
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,840
So anyway, here you go!

232
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,680
What? Do we have to put this on?

233
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,020
Now, shout "Chakudatsu!"

234
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,650
What?

235
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,560
No idea.

236
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,690
What's taking you so long?

237
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,610
The suits will recognize your voices and activate.

238
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,950
Come on, together!

239
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,160
One, two... Chakudatsu!

240
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,620
Chakudatsu?

241
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,980
What the hell?

242
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,280
Young ones are good, too!

243
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,320
What's the meaning of this?

244
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,620
That's right. You can't escape me by using your daughters' naked bodies.

245
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,410
You guys be quiet!

246
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,330
And you can't start fighting until they're done changing, got it?

247
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:05,090
Sarasa, Mayura, you two are going to fight as Kilteans in those suits.

248
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,340
Hello? They've got zippers on the back.

249
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,390
Of course. That's how you get inside.

250
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,230
These powered suits will synchronize with your brain waves alone.

251
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,350
Otherwise, they'd just be ordinary full-body suits.

252
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,610
But why did we have to strip naked?

253
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,740
To establish a strong connection with the suits, it's best to be naked.

254
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,610
Now, get inside!

255
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,620
Go! Dress-up Battle Team Kiltean!

256
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,950
All right, I'll get in.

257
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,120
H-Hey, Sarasa!

258
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,000
With these, we're going to protect the freedom and peace of all humankind.

259
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,920
You too, Mayura!

260
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,980
What's this?

261
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,070
This is a power suit?

262
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,070
Amazing!

263
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,490
— Wh-What are those suits doing?

264
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,410
— Hold on, Kyomoto-sama.
— Wh-What are those suits doing?

265
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,040
They both hold enormous potential.

266
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,960
They may be formidable opponents.

267
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,790
What?

268
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,590
Go! Tin soldiers!

269
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,930
That was a bit mean of you.

270
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:33,970
What are you talking about?

271
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,180
It's your turn, Sarasa.

272
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,720
Okay, here I go!

273
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,230
Take this, you bad guys!

274
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,820
Now who's mean, huh?

275
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,240
That's my girl, Sarasa.

276
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,000
You can do it too, Mayura.

277
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,130
I can't stop!

278
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,710
Mayura!

279
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,680
Are they here to play around?

280
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,140
No, they just haven't figured out how to control their power.

281
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,980
It stopped, finally.

282
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,150
Yeah, sorry about that.

283
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,150
It's hard to control the power, isn't it?

284
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,900
Hey, don't touch me in strange places.

285
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,990
What's wrong, Mayura?

286
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,820
No. I said stop.

287
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,290
That's tickles!

288
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,540
Ouch.

289
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Sorry, Mayura.

290
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,380
But it really tickled.

291
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,590
I see, Doll Dora.

292
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,550
Apparently we don't need to be afraid of Kilteans.

293
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,590
Kyomoto-sama...

294
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,300
I see. I got it.

295
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,180
Go!

296
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,390
Dora Monster #1, Daruma Dora!

297
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,480
Daruma!

298
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,400
Something strange showed up.

299
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,900
It'll be a piece of cake!

300
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,570
Daruma!

301
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,080
Daruma!

302
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,460
Or maybe not.

303
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,170
Who said it'd be easy?

304
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,340
Daruma!

305
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,470
Now!

306
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,800
I have you!

307
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,260
What?

308
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,140
Mayura!

309
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,980
I'll take care of you, little bunny.

310
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,990
Something is wrong.

311
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,990
Oh my, aren't you sensitive?

312
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:06,160
Their suits enhance the girls' five senses as well as their power.

313
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:13,000
That means the suits transfer stimulation from outside to the pilots quite well.

314
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,010
Mayura!

315
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:19,590
Let's see how sensitive the kitten is.

316
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,680
Tin soldiers, tickle her!

317
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,140
Daruma-san's Daruma Beam!

318
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,670
Isn't it time for you to throw in the towel?

319
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,550
If you don't stop now, your daughters are going to suffer from Gestaltzerfall.

320
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,050
You haven't seen anything yet.

321
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,140
Wh-What?

322
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,940
What's that?

323
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,980
I'm sorry.

324
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,860
What just happened?

325
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,360
It's unanalyzable.

326
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,570
However, I see that their power is becoming even stronger.

327
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,570
This is the hyper-mode of Kilteans.

328
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,290
I'm cumming!

329
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,290
What are you doing?

330
