1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:08,869
Any organization, large or small, has
their own share of dark human drama.

2
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:13,777
Greed may enter the picture, especially in cases
involving inheritance and life insurance policies.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,644
In these types of circumstances, the true
colors of humanity reveal themselves.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,021
The incident that occurred at Nonomura
Hospital is an example of this phenomenon.

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:21,721
NONOMURA HOSPITAL

6
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:27,016
One morning, the hospital president was found
dead, and I was privately hired to solve the case.

7
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,531
I infiltrated the hospital in
an inconspicuous manner...

8
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,567
...and managed to acquire some vital clues.

9
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:41,097
The president died while having sex
with a woman who has a beauty mark.

10
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:44,871
But, who secretly made that
phone call and for what purpose?

11
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,438
A woman with a beauty mark.

12
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:53,742
And, what secret is the security
guard blackmailing Rie Makino with?

13
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,815
In the midst of this tangled
web of relationships...

14
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,152
...I have begun to narrow
down the suspects.

15
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:03,185
What do you think?

16
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,861
Have you solved the mystery already?

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,162
This was a narration by Takumaro Kaibara.

18
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:19,639
Mystery of Nonomura Hospital
Episode 2

19
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,011
NONOMURA HOSPITAL

20
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,421
<i>I didn't get enough sleep last night
because of that nasty recorded call.</i>

21
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:33,660
Good morning.

22
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,695
Wash your face and I'll
get you some breakfast.

23
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,719
Great.

24
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,702
What's with that perverted
look on your face?

25
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,595
Um-no, nothing.

26
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,368
You're having dirty thoughts
again, aren't you?

27
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:51,606
Good morning.

28
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,186
Well? Any progress?

29
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,551
Oh, and your electric
wheelchair is here.

30
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,219
That's great, thanks.

31
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,503
This works great.

32
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,370
By the way, I hear that the late
president was really a horny bastard.

33
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,274
I didn't know and I don't care.

34
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,667
Someone's frigid.

35
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,700
Anyway, about the case...

36
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:29,238
It could be a woman,
possibly a nurse.

37
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:36,212
I'd like to get a full report in
the VIP room tonight at 9:30.

38
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,616
I'll be there.

39
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,489
Shimizu from room 409
passed away this morning.

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,923
That's the third one this month.

41
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,467
Apparently, it was a lot worse when the
old hospital president was in charge.

42
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,999
There've been a lot of rumors
about surgical mistakes.

43
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,472
Hey! Thanks for coming.

44
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:02,544
The police said it was a suicide,
but the case is still open.

45
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:03,673
I knew it.

46
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:09,519
The president was apparently addicted
to drugs. They're investigating that.

47
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:14,054
So, did the president accidently
inject himself with cyanide!?

48
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,692
Someone must have switched
it on the night of the murder.

49
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,157
Good morning.

50
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,660
Morning.

51
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,466
She's a charming girl.
Really cute too.

52
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,501
Her nurse is too.

53
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,040
This place has a ton of hot babes.
You should admit yourself.

54
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,613
God! Men are such pigs.

55
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,547
Oh and about Rie Makino...

56
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,442
That's her over there.

57
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,454
Six years ago, her parents
were in a car accident...

58
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,287
...and were admitted to
this hospital, but they died.

59
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,123
At the time, there was a rumor that the president
made a critical error during the surgery.

60
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:52,595
She was adopted by her
aunt and changed her name.

61
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,460
Something smells fishy.

62
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:59,928
I wouldn't want to name her
as a suspect. It's too tragic.

63
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,335
Apparently there have been many
mistakes like that at this hospital.

64
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,246
She's probably not the only
one who's holding a grudge.

65
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,117
By the way...

66
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,953
...can you imagine the
sound of a woman's moan...

67
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,217
...when she's having sex, just
by listening to her normal voice?

68
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,982
Don't ask me that!

69
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,527
Does that mean...

70
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,459
You're a virgin!?

71
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:27,060
W-what!? What do you
mean, "when she's having sex!?"

72
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,693
When I was in the VIP room, someone called and
played a recording of the night the president died...

73
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,266
...and there was a woman
moaning in the background.

74
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:34,871
What?

75
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:35,732
Really?

76
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,841
Why you?

77
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,542
Who knows.
It's our job to find out.

78
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,583
Yeah, but...

79
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,312
Then who, and for what reason?

80
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,687
I don't know. But they seem
to be watching us closely.

81
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,450
Then, am I being watched too?

82
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,394
You've been watched since
you accepted the case.

83
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,861
No way!

84
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,866
Ryoko, you find out how that
bug ended up in my room.

85
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,867
It might have been the same one
that was used at the murder scene.

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,638
Sure.

87
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,301
I'll see if I can get any more
information from the police.

88
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,577
Before you do that, I'd like to get
a wire tapping system for myself.

89
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,008
<i>Staff Announcement:
Miss Mamiya. Miss Mamiya...</i>

90
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,545
<i>Please report to
the Nurse's Station.</i>

91
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,183
I'll see you later.

92
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:23,887
Ok.

93
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,658
Hey!

94
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,125
Oh! Hi, detective.

95
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,434
Do you write in your
journal every day?

96
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,903
Yes. I'm writing a story.

97
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,279
Really!? That sounds interesting.
Will you let me read it?

98
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,877
I can't!

99
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,320
I haven't even let Chisato read it.

100
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,183
That's too bad! Aww, man!

101
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,891
You really want to read it?

102
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,686
Yeah! I really want to read it.

103
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,362
Really? You really want to read it?

104
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:09,433
Of course! I may not look
it, but I love Fantasy books!

105
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,561
To be honest... I'm having
trouble writing the rest.

106
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,934
Will you give me some feedback?

107
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:16,965
Sure.

108
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,239
Then... I'll lend it to you.
But only for one day!

109
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:22,539
Thanks.

110
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:33,081
Mr. Kaibara. This is the staff
assignment chart for that night.

111
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,224
Oh, thank you.

112
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,364
High cut panties!

113
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:55,273
Mr Kaibara! If you're done
here, please excuse yourself!

114
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,208
S-sorry.

115
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,584
Wild taste in undies for
a woman of her age...

116
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,246
A beauty mark!

117
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,649
Miss Makino!

118
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:05,782
Yes?

119
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,701
<i>Chisato Mamiya and Rie Makino were both on
duty on the top floor on the night of the murder.</i>

120
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,942
<i>Miho Nozawa was on duty for the morning
shift, and the other nurse called in sick.</i>

121
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,647
I've been waiting for you.

122
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,049
It's you!

123
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,692
Please go take a bath.
You smell like sweat.

124
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,429
Are you horny from
smelling my hot sweat?

125
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,030
You idiot.

126
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,397
WATER REHABILITATION ROOM

127
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,439
Want to join me?

128
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,015
This feels great!!

129
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,350
How's the water temperature?

130
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,841
Good! Good!
This is heavenly!

131
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,627
It was a joke! Don't take me seriously!

132
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,796
This isn't a co-ed bath!

133
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:17,694
I... I'm getting out.

134
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,667
But you're usually such a pervert...

135
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,636
That's all show. That's not really me.

136
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,932
Liar. You seem pretty happy.

137
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:32,042
Why are you...! Trying to distract me
from the investigation isn't gonna work!

138
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,346
Don't... mess... with... me!

139
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,850
I beg you. Please don't investigate her!

140
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,511
Who are you talking about?

141
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,849
You suspect Rie, right?

142
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,412
I'm not convinced yet
that she's the murderer.

143
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:49,751
Her motives are suspicious,
but there're other suspects.

144
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,489
Let's talk in my room.
I'd like to save Rie too.

145
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:58,036
I'm sorry... I... You're a good person.

146
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,070
You're really going?

147
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,175
Why did I have to act like a gentleman?

148
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,247
Rie and I lived together in the same dorm.

149
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:23,553
When I got dumped by my
boyfriend, I attempted suicide.

150
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,164
She was the one who stopped me.

151
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,532
If I hadn't had Rie, I probably wouldn't
have been able to get back on my feet.

152
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,007
Then you know about her parents, and the
president's mistake during their surgery?

153
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,578
Figures... you've already investigated.

154
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,845
Why do you think Rie is the murderer?

155
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:49,718
That day...

156
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,223
I was changing to go on duty
for my morning shift when...

157
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,658
...Rie came in crying.

158
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,862
I asked her what was wrong,
and all she could do was cry.

159
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,935
Later, I found out about the murder.

160
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,236
I thought that she'd finally done it.

161
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,110
What time was it?

162
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,244
Around nine.

163
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,871
Do you know about the security guard?

164
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,681
Huh? What's that?

165
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:20,277
I haven't mentioned anything
to Rie about it since then, so...

166
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,721
I'll tell you after I've thought
about it some more.

167
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,458
OK. You promise?

168
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:27,725
Yeah.

169
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,526
Tonight is the night I
will defeat the demon.

170
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,933
The prince gave me a vial of
the demon's favorite nectar.

171
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,476
I'm going to switch it with poison.

172
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,414
The demon always bathes
before the ceremony...

173
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,875
I was able to successfully switch the vial.

174
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,148
The demon came towards me
and raised me on the platform.

175
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,491
His serpent tongue licks my
black star in my pussy.

176
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:10,130
Your beauty mark in your
pussy makes me so horny.

177
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,567
I love it when you cry like that.

178
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,438
<i>A black star!</i>

179
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,834
<i>The woman with the
beauty mark is Momoko!?</i>

180
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,478
The demon drank the nectar as usual.

181
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,280
Then the ceremony begins.

182
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,712
But it's different this time...

183
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,922
The painful ceremonies will be over soon...

184
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,919
I must hold on... I must hold on...

185
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,767
The demon is dead.

186
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,800
The prince promised me he
would take care of the rest...

187
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,543
...before the witch, the demon's
queen, comes at dawn.

188
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,406
<i>Could the prince be...</i>

189
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,778
<i>It's dated the night of
the murder. It has to be!</i>

190
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:07,921
<i>She had trouble handling her guilt, so
to cope with it, she wrote it all down.</i>

191
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,992
I can't bear to tell the prince the truth.

192
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,068
I can't tell him I dropped...

193
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,968
...the vial before I switched it.

194
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,679
Momoko and the "prince" are both innocent.

195
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,112
The mastermind is someone else!!

196
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,252
Hey!

197
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,592
Can I have a little bit
of your time? Please?

198
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,694
S-sure...

199
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,457
FILE ROOM

200
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,388
This is...

201
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:52,232
Your true objective has been to locate your
parent's medical records in that room.

202
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,060
Am I wrong?

203
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,836
How did you know that?

204
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:58,943
A detective needs to think things through,
but they also have to follow their instincts.

205
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,580
You wanted to see your
parents' medical records...

206
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,351
...to see if there actually was a
mistake during their surgery, right?

207
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:11,987
That day, you witnessed Chisato
coming out of the VIP room.

208
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,986
It seems like you're concealing that fact.

209
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,555
Why are you covering for her?

210
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:27,700
When my parents died, it was
Chisato's father who took care of me.

211
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:28,874
What?

212
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:32,278
How am I supposed to tell people my
benefactor's daughter is a criminal?

213
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,506
That's what it was...

214
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,380
That morning I was in charge
of the linens in the VIP room.

215
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:42,454
I wasn't told that the
president was staying.

216
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,958
When I got off the elevator
to change the linens...

217
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,121
...I saw someone walking down the
stairs at the end of the hallway.

218
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,763
And that was Chisato?

219
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,527
I only got a glimpse,
but I'm positive it was her.

220
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,158
I thought it was strange, and
I peeked into the VIP room.

221
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,969
That's when...

222
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,432
Thanks for telling me.

223
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,912
What's going to happen to Chisato?

224
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,416
She's not the murderer.

225
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,684
Really?

226
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,451
Yes.

227
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,789
So if the security guard makes
any more advances, tell him no.

228
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,051
I assure you, you don't have to worry.

229
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,806
<i>Mr. Kaibara.</i>

230
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:45,948
Forgive me.

231
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:50,153
This is what you get for saying
you want to quit the hospital.

232
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,451
You're my slave forever!

233
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,423
No!

234
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:07,168
Or do you want me to distribute
that embarrassing tape!?

235
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,140
Stop please!

236
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,811
Ever since the president
showed you how to use it...

237
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,372
...your cunt has been enjoyed
by many of our customers.

238
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,218
Look...

239
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,049
You're so wet.

240
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,414
Please stop!!

241
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,123
<i>Chisato has a beauty mark too.</i>

242
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,209
<i>Hello, this is Kawasaki.</i>

243
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,546
I found the murderer!

244
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,915
<i>Really? That was fast!</i>

245
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,383
Come quick!

246
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,153
Just in case, contact the
police before you come!

247
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,882
This is front page news!

248
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,858
What did you say!?

249
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,095
A couple of the member tapes are gone.

250
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,154
Could that detective or his
assistant have taken them?

251
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,732
Unacceptable!

252
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:07,833
If that got out... It would
cause a scandal...

253
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,063
...that would rock both the
political and financial worlds.

254
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,871
Forget about collecting the life
insurance. We'll lose our funding!

255
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,740
Let's get rid of them.

256
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,042
The sooner the better.
We can do it tonight.

257
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,910
NURSE'S STATION

258
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,553
Yes?

259
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,315
Come here.

260
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:33,420
Chisato is...?

261
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,997
Akiko and Fujiki should be leaving
the president's office soon.

262
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,330
Sneak in after making sure
they've left. Got it?

263
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,811
This is Fujiki.

264
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,348
What?

265
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,354
Follow the plan.

266
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,092
The assistant is here.

267
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,600
It's Kaibara.

268
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,203
I've been waiting for you.
Please come in.

269
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,847
I've prepared the finest tea for you.

270
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,625
I'll gladly accept, since
I've finished the case.

271
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,685
Then I'd love to hear
your skilled conclusion.

272
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:47,132
It's just as you said,
this is a case of murder.

273
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:51,336
Momoko and Chisato, who were being threatened
by the president, plotted the murder.

274
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,441
But their plan was overheard by
others who had planted a bug.

275
00:17:55,441 --> 00:18:02,147
Plus, they saw Momoko drop and break the
poison ampul meant to kill the president.

276
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:06,516
But they had also anticipated that, and
switched it with a poison ampul ahead of time.

277
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:14,421
You say it as if you witnessed it.
Then who's the mastermind?

278
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:24,903
Just in case, secretly destroy all of the
other illegally recorded member tapes.

279
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,097
As you wish.

280
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:30,442
And make sure you get rid of the one
that was taped that night, by tonight.

281
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,605
From the point when my husband gets in the
shower, to the part when Momoko comes...

282
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,841
Even the part when you
switch it, it's all recorded.

283
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,016
You still had it?

284
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:44,217
Seeing my husband being murdered doesn't get
boring, no matter how many times I watch it.

285
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,316
He used my family's connection to
the political and financial worlds.

286
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,226
He made a fortune prostituting
the nurses and selling illicit drugs!

287
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,759
It was a loveless marriage
only meant to use me.

288
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,393
If we hadn't managed to overhear
the nurses' murderous plot...

289
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,768
...you would have ended
up doing it yourself.

290
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,067
Yes.

291
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,177
And then they covered for each other.

292
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,713
The police had no choice
except to rule it a suicide!

293
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,182
I still want my husband's life insurance!

294
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,673
That's why I hired
that stupid detective.

295
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,341
Y-yes...

296
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,811
We're almost there!

297
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:25,859
It was useless to play that recording
to try to make me blame those girls.

298
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:31,229
You should have followed
the trail we laid out for you.

299
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,200
I'm not about to let you
have the insurance money.

300
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,444
If we investigate the route between
Momoko's room and the VIP room...

301
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,877
...we should be able to
find a chemical residue.

302
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,814
Well done.

303
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:55,627
Ryoko might have had faulty reasoning, but
she was dead on about the mastermind.

304
00:19:55,627 --> 00:20:01,065
That stupid girl is about to disappear
forever into the incinerator in the basement.

305
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,899
What did you put in it...

306
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,438
Damn it!!

307
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:11,068
You just take a nap here
until Fujiki and I return.

308
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:23,721
Fujiki. Don't you think it's a
waste to just kill and burn her?

309
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,389
Do whatever you want. It
doesn't matter either way.

310
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,794
I'll make you feel good before you die.

311
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,150
My Lady!

312
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:57,086
Dear, dear. You haven't killed her yet?

313
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,392
I didn't think it would hurt to
let Tanaka have a little fun.

314
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,984
Hey. Hurry it up!

315
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,218
Wait!!

316
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,825
There's something I want to ask her first.

317
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,507
Fujiki!

318
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,337
Yes.

319
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,852
It's better to speak up.

320
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:57,644
Little girl, you're going to tell
me where you hid the tapes.

321
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,622
No!! I don't know anything
about any tapes.

322
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:07,718
Oh really? I wonder how
long you can keep that up.

323
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,022
W-what!?

324
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:16,935
The brakes!

325
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,197
Shit! I can't cut
the power either!

326
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,439
The elevator's open!

327
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,565
That fucking bitch!

328
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,844
Please stop!

329
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,118
Tell me where the tape is!

330
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,267
If I get thrown off...

331
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,201
...it's gonna hurt so bad!!

332
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,104
What a stubborn girl!

333
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,234
Takumaro, help me...

334
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,781
My Lady. Maybe she
really doesn't know.

335
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:06,351
Seems so... That stupid
detective must have the tapes.

336
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,943
I'm done with you.

337
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,382
I'll make your precious hole bigger.

338
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,096
Oh my! What a rude girl.

339
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,564
My Lady, um...

340
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,467
Sure, do as you please.

341
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,959
Clean her pussy for her.

342
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,565
Stop!!

343
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,409
Mr. Kaibara!

344
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,809
Stop me! Stop me! Stop me!!

345
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,486
Kaibara!!

346
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,791
Miho! Stop me
with your breasts!!

347
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,290
Carry me to the incinerator
in the basement...

348
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,773
No! Help!!

349
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,444
Hurry!!

350
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,433
Gotcha!!

351
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,804
Hold it right there!

352
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,317
Go Kaibara!!

353
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,807
You fucking pervert!!

354
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,820
You're all right now.

355
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,356
You idiot!

356
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,230
What took you so long!!

357
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,832
I was so scared.

358
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,306
Sorry.

359
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,019
Thanks.

360
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,182
NONOMURA HOSPITAL

361
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,120
Morning.

362
00:24:58,597 --> 00:24:59,655
Morning.

363
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,761
What's wrong? You don't seem like yourself.

364
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,734
Are you not feeling well?

365
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,065
Y-yeah...

366
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,777
Hey! You're acting strange today!

367
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:16,948
I don't care if I'm acting strange.
Thank you for saving Rie.

368
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,918
This is the only way
I can repay you.

369
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,488
You don't need to thank
me... but... your... umm...

370
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,750
My feelings for you are...

371
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,183
Here... Feel it...

372
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,025
I'm feeling guilty about your girlfriend.

373
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,391
D... don't worry about it.
She's my assistant.

374
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,708
Detective... Not yet... Not yet...

375
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:02,849
Takumaru, you asshole!!
