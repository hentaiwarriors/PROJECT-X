1
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,130
- Do you see anything?
- No, nothing.

2
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,070
Come on, move it!

3
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,610
Don't cross the tape!

4
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,940
The cops are here.

5
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,550
I heard it was a little girl.

6
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,180
Who's that?

7
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,820
Did you see what happened?

8
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,860
Stop! No admission.

9
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,400
Excuse me!

10
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,010
She's still a kid.

11
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,470
Lieutenant, there's a girl over there.

12
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,380
Kenzo! Time for work!

13
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,650
All right.

14
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,200
Look at me.
Are you hurt anywhere?

15
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,420
Kekkai
Report 1: Nature Clinical Interrogation

16
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,990
General Hospital

17
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,600
I have her sleeping on analgesics.
But she's in an abnormal state.

18
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,680
Abnormal?

19
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,080
Yes. She is very disoriented,
and there are signs of amnesia.

20
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
If you can, it's probably best...

21
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,550
to have a professional psychiatrist
have a look at her.

22
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,520
A professional psychiatrist?

23
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,180
I found this in her pocket.

24
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,330
Kyoko.

25
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,600
Doctor, it feels so good.

26
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,000
Damn it.

27
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,550
You sure took awhile. Sleeping in?
Wish I was you.

28
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,560
It's you, Kaoru. I'm busy right now.

29
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,120
Busy? Today's your day off, isn't it?
I'll be over there soon.

30
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,890
I'm about to leave. I'll talk to you later.

31
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,860
Liar. I know you.

32
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,670
Sorry, but today's examination is over.

33
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,870
What? Come on, Doctor!

34
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,740
No!

35
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,120
Doctor, so you are in.

36
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,330
"I don't want any trouble"
is written all over your face.

37
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,170
I don't see how you work as a clinical
psychologist with that attitude.

38
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,930
There's half-naked
police officers, so why not?

39
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,010
You know, that's a pretty flashy car
you have out there...

40
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,210
and you're still having a guy
drive you around town in it?

41
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,510
That has nothing to do with this!
I came here on business!

42
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,520
I got it! I'll listen to what you have to say...

43
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,190
but do something about that car
parked out front.

44
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,260
It doesn't help business at all!

45
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,690
I'll make sure you listen to every last word.

46
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,510
It's me. I have a favor to ask.
It's going to take a little while.

47
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,510
Drive around the block a couple of times.
Yes, that's right. Could you do that?

48
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,250
I'll call you later.

49
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,220
Now, then.

50
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,990
Look at these.

51
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,660
No identification,
cause of death is due...

52
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,670
to loss of blood,
and the object of the crime was...

53
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,770
Rape?

54
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,670
Right. Currently the leftover semen
found inside of her is at the lab.

55
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,680
The problem is the girl we took
under protection at the scene.

56
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,880
What I want to ask of you is to treat her.

57
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,380
I see.

58
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,160
This is the background report.
You should definitely read it first.

59
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,390
I don't feel like it, you read it.

60
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,330
It'll take a while, you know.

61
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,290
Thanks to you, I have plenty of time.

62
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,500
Okay.

63
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,470
Do you always cross your legs
like that when talking to someone?

64
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,470
Well, most of the time. Why?

65
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,600
When you move around like that,
I can see your panties.

66
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,380
You were looking?

67
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,480
I see that you're still into pink.

68
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,920
Does it make you horny?

69
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,570
Hey, wait!

70
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,270
This is too sudden.

71
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,710
I'm horny, just as you said.

72
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,890
- Wait!
- You asked for it.

73
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,820
But, I have work.

74
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,830
Don't stop, please!

75
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,350
Now for work. Tell me all about it.

76
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,310
Where was I now?

77
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,920
Did you find out the identity
of the girl under protection?

78
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,890
Currently she is still unidentified.
The only lead is a picture.

79
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,620
This is it.

80
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,860
Looks like Kyoko.

81
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,340
Probably the girl's name.
Can't say for sure, though.

82
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,040
So, is that girl also a victim?

83
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,180
I don't know. Maybe she's a victim,
maybe she's an assailant.

84
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,950
At the very least
there were no signs of rape.

85
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,510
Plus, there's something that bugs me.

86
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,090
There's scars all over her back
and her chest.

87
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,190
Most seem to be childhood scars.

88
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,490
There's also a tattoo on her right shoulder.
A tattoo of a rose.

89
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,340
Childhood scars?
You mean, from child abuse?

90
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,770
I don't know. Haven't got a clue.

91
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,910
That's why I've come here for your help.

92
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,880
If she's a witness, then she may be
the key to solving this case.

93
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,840
This will be a tough one.

94
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,550
General Hospital

95
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,760
I never did like this hospital.

96
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,300
It's like any other hospital.

97
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,940
No it's not. This place is heavily secured.

98
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,610
Of course it is. The culprit may be after her.

99
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,480
How's she doing?

100
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,980
She's been asleep the whole time.

101
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,020
The pain-killers should
have worn off by now.

102
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,950
I see. Could you leave the room?

103
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,010
Okay.

104
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,660
It's too bright in here.

105
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
Wait, Junichi.

106
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,920
She doesn't like the dark.
She's afraid of it.

107
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,030
Thank you.

108
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,720
Good afternoon, Kyoko.
Glad to see you're awake.

109
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,520
You're Kyoko, aren't you?

110
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,590
I'm Junichi. I'm a doctor, you know.

111
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,770
Kyoko, we're on your side.
We want to help you. Believe in us.

112
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,010
Hey, can you hear anything?

113
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,870
Hey, Kaoru!

114
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,610
What did you see there?

115
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,980
You saw something!

116
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,990
What did you see? Tell me!

117
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,650
Kaoru, stop that!

118
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,420
No!

119
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,550
What's wrong? Calm down.

120
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,020
I'm scared. I'm scared.

121
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,170
It's okay, there's nothing to be afraid of.

122
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,740
Kyoko?

123
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,570
That's not your name?

124
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,250
Kyoko's gone, she went over there.

125
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,390
Who are you?

126
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,490
Sachi.

127
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,910
Sachi?

128
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,120
Yes.

129
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,560
Sachi, how old are you?

130
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,760
I'm nineteen.

131
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,840
I see. So where did Kyoko go?

132
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,660
I don't know.

133
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,940
I'm becoming really sleepy.

134
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,250
That's okay.

135
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,380
There's nothing to fear,
so you can rest easy.

136
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,790
What was that?

137
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,030
That wasn't acting, right?

138
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,230
Is that what they call multiple personality?

139
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,440
Disassociative disorder.

140
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,370
That's the official name.

141
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,200
Do you think she contacted that
because of me?

142
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,440
No, it didn't seem like
this was the first time.

143
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,000
Sachi was there before that.

144
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,880
And don't say or do anything rash
during our sessions.

145
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,990
I'm sorry about that.
So, what do we do now?

146
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,120
It's possible to cure her.
But I can't do it here.

147
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,260
Don't tell me you need to move
her to your place.

148
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,260
It's better than here.

149
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,000
Hold it! There's no way
I'd get permission to do such a thing.

150
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,600
In a stuffy place like this,
her sickness will only get worse.

151
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,200
But still.

152
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,630
You want clues, don't you?

153
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,410
If I treat her at my clinic,
I may be able to get something out of her.

154
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,850
I understand.

155
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,710
I'll try and convince them
to move our out of here.

156
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,950
I'll do it as soon as possible.

157
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,780
Quick to take the offensive as usual.

158
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,360
Don't joke around.

159
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,690
You better make sure you cure her.

160
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,390
I'm a professional. I'll do my best.

161
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,960
I'll take your word for it.

162
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,880
What's wrong?

163
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,010
You can't sleep?

164
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,710
I'm not Sachi, for your information.
I'm Ryo.

165
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,330
Ryo?

166
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,420
That's correct.

167
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,720
And so have you been there all along?

168
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,260
Yes, I've been here since long ago.

169
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,560
Then you already know who I am, right?

170
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,770
Yes, I have already heard about you.

171
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,070
So why do you decided to come out?

172
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,540
Because Sachi was sleeping.

173
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,240
Do you have anything to tell me?

174
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,250
Yes.

175
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,250
Sit down over there.

176
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,550
Kyoko is asking me for my help.

177
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,160
You said that you're Kyoko's
friend, didn't you?

178
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,820
Yeah, that's what I said.

179
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,020
Please protect Kyoko.

180
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,160
Protect?

181
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,400
Kyoko is being targeted.

182
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,790
Targeted? By whom?

183
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,130
I beg of you, protect Kyoko.

184
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,530
Wait a second, Ryo.
What's that supposed to...

185
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,600
Ryo?

186
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,840
Is that you?

187
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,950
Pee-pee.

188
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,710
I go pee-pee.

189
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,420
It's you, Sachi. Come here, it's this way.

190
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,350
Okay!

191
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,020
Good night.

192
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,300
No! Stay here.

193
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,430
Okay. I'll stay here,
you can sleep tight.

194
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,540
You promise? Goodnight.

195
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,860
Good morning.

196
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,170
You're Kyoko, right?

197
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,780
I want to have a little chat with you, okay?

198
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,220
Kyoko, there's no need
for you to be nervous.

199
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,220
Look.

200
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,430
Quiet, isn't it?

201
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,100
The ticking of the clock, your breathing.
What else do you hear?

202
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,970
You can hear something else?
What sound do you hear?

203
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,740
What is it?

204
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,740
Footsteps.

205
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,470
Footsteps?

206
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,980
Footsteps.

207
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,010
Those are your footsteps, aren't they?

208
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,590
Where are you trying to walk, Kyoko?

209
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,620
It's very dark.

210
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,290
Somewhere dark?
You're going someplace dark?

211
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,390
A dark street.

212
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,790
Are you walking by yourself?

213
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,240
A dark street between buildings.

214
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,440
Then let's find a brighter place.

215
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,680
Look for the light.

216
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,750
Look for light.

217
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,710
Dark, dark, it's so dark!

218
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,120
Kyoko! Open your eyes!

219
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,990
Wake up, Kyoko.

220
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,320
I'm sorry about that, Kyoko.
For putting too much strain on you.

221
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,630
Who are you?

222
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,270
Kyoko.

223
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,340
No, you're not.

224
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,670
Maybe I'm Ryo.

225
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,810
You're neither Kyoko nor Ryo.

226
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,740
Who in the world are you?

227
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,310
Tell me.

228
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,290
Yoko.

229
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,630
Yoko, is it?

230
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,490
Can we have a little conversation?

231
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,160
I've something I want to ask you.

232
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,550
What's that?

233
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,860
Hey...

234
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,200
Have you been having sex lately?

235
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,470
Listen, here...

236
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,570
Why don't you tell me
how long you've been inside Kyoko?

237
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,950
If you listen to me, I'll tell you.

238
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,190
Fine, then. Go ahead.

239
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,050
Look.

240
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,990
See, Doctor?

241
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,930
Put on your clothes.

242
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,670
Doctor.

243
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,220
You're Kyoko's friend, right?

244
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,560
Then save me, too.

245
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,560
What should I do?

246
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,500
Hold me. Protect me.

247
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,030
Doctor.

248
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,210
Doctor, fuck me!

249
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,650
Fuck me!

250
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,180
Hello, ICP Japan Office.

251
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,190
Yes, I understand.

252
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,530
What was that?

253
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,240
- She's dead.
- Who is?

254
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,510
The hospital.

255
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,800
Calm down!

256
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,540
What was that for?
The nurse at the hospital was killed.

257
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,070
What nurse?

258
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,650
The nurse that was in Kyoko's room.

259
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,190
Let's go then. Now!

260
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,370
It's the same.

261
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,560
You think it's the same culprit?

262
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,410
Probably.

263
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,770
But why was Kyoko's nurse
the target this time?
