1
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,370
Good Morning, Kosuke-onii-chan.

2
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,290
Hey! Good Morning, Chika.

3
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,570
Anything I can help out with?

4
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,520
Only 3 more days, huh?

5
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:38,470
Sazanami Girls Dorm

6
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:46,509
TRIANGLE HEART

7
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:52,763
~ Sazanami Spring ~

8
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,300
Oh man, I'm tired.

9
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,150
Nimura-San..?

10
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,810
Hmm... a little hard don't you think?

11
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,020
Kanzaki... have you been playing with them too much?

12
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,400
Absolutely not!

13
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,740
Will you cut it out?!

14
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,110
Dive.

15
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,330
How many times have I told you not to jump into the bath like that?!

16
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,590
But you always take so long!

17
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,740
Hold it right there!

18
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,100
Chika-bu help me..!

19
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,800
Chika-chan, That Cat has to die. I won't forgive it standing in my way.

20
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,200
Oh no, no, no it wasn't me!

21
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:14,670
Kanzaki, listen I'm tired... stop making so much damned noise.

22
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,250
Ni..Nimura san...

23
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,420
Chance! Now's my chance!

24
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,840
Wait... oh...

25
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,830
Oh lookie here... looks like you like it! Kanzaki

26
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,760
What kind of stupid...

27
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,050
Mayu-onee-chan, cut it out! You're making it hard for Kosuke-onii-chan.

28
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,140
What...? Kosuke is getting hard...?

29
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,241
Absolutely not!

30
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:40,797
<i>But now that you mention it, being in a position like this...</i>

31
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,900
<i>It would be impossible to not notice...</i>

32
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,650
Good morning

33
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,000
Good morning

34
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,540
Nimura-san!

35
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,450
Oh its fine! It didn't harm anyone.

36
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,320
That isn't the point...

37
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:11,160
Oh! Kaoru-san.. It's probably a good idea to put on some clothes when you get out of the bath.

38
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,230
A wise man once said, "Nudity is the best form of dress!...

39
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:31,270
But you might end up with a cold". This is the worst time of year for that. You should be careful!

40
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,840
It doesn't look like Mio-chan is eating today again, is she?

41
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,510
Eh, just leave it be. It's her choice.

42
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,060
Don't bother yourself. It isn't like she'll die.

43
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,130
But ever since I got here she hasn't eaten with us even once.

44
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,560
She just started doing that out of nowhere.

45
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,770
Mio-chan, Aren't you eating breakfast?

46
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,820
No thanks.

47
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,780
I'm not hungry. See ya later!

48
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,030
Otera! Piro! Let's go.

49
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,460
<i>This all started because Aunt Kanna asked me...</i>

50
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:24,802
<i>to take over as the manager of the girls dorm over spring vacation.</i>

51
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,090
<i>Ever since I came here, it's been an adventure from morning 'til night.</i>

52
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,215
<i>It's great that I feel like I have a bunch of new adorable sisters,</i>

53
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:37,430
<i>but for some reason it seems like Mio-chan doesn't like me.</i>

54
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,230
<i>I'm only working here until tomorrow so it would be nice
if she at least had a meal with us once.</i>

55
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,750
Oh!  The sakura blossoms are blooming!

56
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,270
She certainly leaves herself vulnerable.. given that there is a young man around.

57
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:45,160
Whoa there! This isn't good. What the hell am I thinking..? Okay, okay work, work, work...

58
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,080
Oh man, that's a good smell!

59
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,050
Kosuke-sama...

60
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,960
Is something the matter?

61
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,510
Oh no, no, no... just thought I would take a breather for a min... ahahaha...

62
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,520
Oh man, what the hell is that..? REAL smooth...

63
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,950
Whats with this guy?

64
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,690
I mean what where you up to?

65
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,670
I don't know. It's kind of cute.

66
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,090
Seriously uncoordinated.

67
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,750
It's unbelievable!

68
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,820
Someone's making a late dinner?

69
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,190
If they would've said something I could have cooked.

70
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,490
Ah Chika-bu. Your food brings me back to life.

71
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,410
If you're that hungry, why don't you just eat with everyone?

72
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,250
THERE IS NO WAY!

73
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,460
Wh..why?

74
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,130
I don't want to eat the food that guys make!

75
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,680
Why? Kosuke-nii-chan is a good guy. He's nice and is a great cook.

76
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,640
It's not about if he's a good guy or if he's a good cook.

77
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,810
Soooo. what is it then?

78
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,680
It's...chika-bu wouldn't understand.

79
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:35,110
Why? We are good friends, aren't we Mio-chan? You can't even tell me?

80
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,780
C'mon! Tell me! C'mon!

81
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,620
This one thing... I... I can't!

82
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,660
Eh? Mio-chan...

83
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:56,630
And on that note... Chika-bu's fried rice was delicious! I'll pay you back for it somehow.

84
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,520
That was delicious!

85
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,190
<i>And today would have been the last time...</i>

86
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,320
Yes?

87
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,950
It's Kosuke

88
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,290
Good Afternoon. Do you need something?

89
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,750
Uhm... I'd like to ask you about something.

90
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,130
Come on in. It might be a bit messy though.

91
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,260
No, no don't worry about it. Shall I help you clean up?

92
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,520
Oh that's...

93
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,770
Part of Mio's new school uniform.

94
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,150
It changed for her new grade.

95
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,400
Ah... the new semester starts tomorrow, doesn't it?

96
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,320
So what did you want to talk about...?
It's Mio-chan, right?

97
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,790
Yeah... why do you think Mio-chan
doesn't eat when I cook?

98
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,420
Mio-chan came here right after she was born.

99
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,170
It was even before everyone was here.

100
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:23,080
The manager before Kanna-san, Keigo-san was the one that found Mio-chan.

101
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,084
Since she was found, it was like a real family for Mio-chan.

102
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:35,872
I even felt like I had a new baby sister and I was so happy.

103
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,900
Oh right... Ai-san doesn't have a family.

104
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,636
But when Mio-chan was 5, Keigo-san had to leave...

105
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:50,920
and Mio-chan kind of felt abandoned.

106
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,224
He said I'll definately come back. Just wait for me.

107
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:59,972
When I come back I'll be the manager again so we'll always be together.

108
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:03,658
Mio-chan hasn't been the same since.

109
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:12,690
Dont tell me that Mio thinks if I stay that Keigo-san won't have a place to come back to.

110
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,250
I've got it!

111
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,340
What if we cooked Keigo-san's favorite dish?

112
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,700
Oh hey, then she might eat with us!

113
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:30,490
Let me think... It was white... kinda salty... sorta savory...

114
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,880
Ai-san, we aren't going to figure it out just on that. If you could just come up with a few more details.

115
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,790
Uh... the sauce was a little spicy.

116
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,300
Sauce? What was the color?

117
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,250
Uh... It was red.

118
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,940
Red...? Tomato sauce?

119
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,500
Thats right! It was tomato sauce!

120
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:56,270
So it had white fish and tomato sauce... hmm. We might be able to make it!

121
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,520
Do you really think so?

122
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,900
Leave it to me!

123
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,110
See you when you get back!

124
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,790
Please buy this stuff... Wha?

125
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,670
Oh its fine, don't you think? Let's get out there and get the stuff for Keigo-san's meal!

126
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,460
Uh... yeah!

127
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,340
Alright let's get this place ready...

128
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,720
As for me, I think I'll catch some zzz's...

129
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,290
Joking... just a joke.

130
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,230
Oh it was a joke was it? Well then...

131
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,810
Hey I said it was a joke... Hey are you listening? I was joking!

132
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,660
Next is Mayuki-san's painting stuff, right? Hmmm? Ai-san?

133
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,880
Oh! Ai-chan! Is that your boyfriend? Hey isn't that the Sazanami-kid?

134
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,340
It's not like that.

135
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,510
It's probably better if you put yourself out there, Ai-chan. You don't want to stay at the Sazanami place forever.

136
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,050
It's fine. I like where I am.

137
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,350
Is that so? Well that's fine then. Hey what's up buddy? What can I get you today?

138
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,940
What do you have in the way of white fish?

139
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,730
Ah! Well today we have just about everything.

140
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,660
Hee, hee... "Is that your boyfriend?"

141
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,330
I bet it looks like that, don't ya think?

142
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,330
Uh... yeah, I suppose so.

143
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,040
Kosuke-san!

144
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,790
Lets hurry home!

145
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,510
Kanzaki, shouldn't you go up a bit on the left?

146
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,700
Oh? really?

147
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,090
Huh? Like this?

148
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,170
Onee-chan, was this my job?

149
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,730
What are you doing?

150
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,020
The sakura blossoms sure are pretty, aren't they?

151
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,970
Yeah, we should go check them out next week...

152
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:09,235
Wait that might be too late then.

153
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,160
We should go flower viewing. It's best to see them early on.

154
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,490
Yeah, I suppose you're right

155
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,950
I wonder when we should go?

156
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,110
If they were to go next week I'd...

157
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,960
We're back!

158
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,260
Why is this cat girl always getting in my way?

159
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,090
Oh come on, you can deal with this little bit!

160
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,630
Oh my god, you are gonna start a fire!

161
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,180
Uh oh, here comes the counter-attack!

162
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,310
Water! Get water, quick!

163
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,980
Here's the fire extinguisher.

164
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,990
Oops! They're back!

165
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,150
Aw, what the heck are you doing back so early?

166
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,580
You should've taken your time!

167
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,040
What is all this craziness?

168
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,880
What do you mean? You can tell just by looking... It's a going away party.

169
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,170
Sorry about the mess but that damned cat...

170
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,730
Hey! Don't put it all on me! You did plenty of this too!

171
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,770
What did you say?

172
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,990
You okay, Kosuke-san?

173
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,940
Oh I think I've already resigned myself to my fate.

174
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,580
Cheers for all of Kosuke's hard work!

175
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,000
Cheers!

176
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,710
This is damned delicious. Perfect flavor!

177
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,590
Isn't it?

178
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,210
The potatoes are delicious too!

179
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,340
Yup, yup!

180
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,080
This salad too!

181
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,050
Sure is!

182
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,720
This cabbage is wonderful!

183
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,510
Oh, I'm so glad. This is the first time I've ever made banquet-style food...

184
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:09,190
For you to be able to make this without any practice. I guess you really can cook!

185
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,530
Chika... so what were you thinking up until now?

186
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,110
Beginner's luck.

187
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,910
Mio-chan, aren't you going to eat?

188
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,320
Oh, I just can't do it!

189
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,970
Eh... wha? Let me down! Stop!

190
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:51,270
It's ok... just have a bite. Kosuke-san made this meal specially for you.

191
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,220
For your sake Mio-chan.

192
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,910
This.. this is dad's...

193
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,430
Kosuke-san put his whole heart into it.

194
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,900
This is your home. We're all your family.

195
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,290
Chika-chan, Mayuki-san, Kaoru-san, Izayoi-san, Kosuke-san and me too.

196
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,434
And of course, Keigo-san. So remember, you have family.

197
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:56,135
So Keigo-san will always have a place to come home to.

198
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,737
Mio-chan and everyone is waiting for him.

199
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:03,751
When he gets back we can all live together! Everyone together.. right?

200
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,980
<i>Everyone together... huh?</i>

201
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,320
It looks like everyone's passed out, huh?

202
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,450
Well this kind of party doesn't happen all the time.

203
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,490
Cheers!

204
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,730
Beautiful.

205
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,200
The sakura blossoms...

206
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:42,630
Sorry... this is the end so.. I mean.. after tomorrow...

207
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,300
I'm so glad you came, Kosuke-san.

208
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:55,400
I know I was saying it to Mio-chan but the one here who really wants a family is me.

209
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,665
I don't have siblings or parents...

210
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:02,367
So if Kanna-san and you were gone I'd...

211
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,500
I'll come back again... I swear.. I'll come back.

212
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,750
Kosuke-san...

213
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,260
Kosuke-san...

214
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,910
You're beautiful you know.

215
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,680
No, don't stare at me like that...

216
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,540
This time let me...

217
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:42,980
Ai-san...

218
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,940
Oh, Kosuke-san!

219
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,150
Ai-san!

220
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,040
I'm gonna...

221
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,910
Yes!

222
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:17,060
Yes.. This is Sazanami Girls dorm. Kanna-san?

223
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,310
What's going on this late at night?

224
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,180
Yes... everyone's fine but... how are you doing? Spring break is over...

225
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:33,450
Huh?

226
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,790
You 'got' it?... what did you get?

227
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,360
<i>M-A-N!</i>

228
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,870
A man?!

229
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>Yes, finally after all this time..</i>

230
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,513
<i>His weight, his size, his girth!</i>

231
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:55,884
<i>It's like he was born just for me!</i>

232
00:23:55,885 --> 00:24:00,639
<i>I'm going to stay here with him from now on.</i>

233
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:02,300
Okay, but let's talk about...

234
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,190
M-marriage?!

235
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,440
MARRIAGE?!

236
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:15,120
Wait you aren't... you aren't coming back!?

237
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,620
You're leaving everything to Kosuke-san? That means...

238
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,130
Here to stay!

239
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,550
Debuting my new school uniform..

240
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,100
Is it me?

241
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,690
Totally cute, Chika!

242
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,890
Ding! Check out mine too!

243
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,640
Oh!

244
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,100
You made school clothes for the cat?

245
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,210
What's the point of dressing up animals?

246
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,810
What if you just make her a leash?

247
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,690
Actually, even Kaoru has a new piece of clothing for school.

248
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,270
Izayoi! Don't go around announcing it!

249
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,200
How is it new?

250
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,380
See? Take a look at this ribbon. It's a bit more red don't you think?

251
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,400
Oh?!

252
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,750
Well, I guess if you're looking there...

253
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,440
Oh REALLY...

254
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,390
Wow, you really are taking your time for a new semester.

255
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,750
AH! We're gonna be late!

256
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,050
Be back later!

257
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,630
See you later!

258
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:31,020
<i>And that is how I ended up here. I wonder if I can make a family here too?</i>
