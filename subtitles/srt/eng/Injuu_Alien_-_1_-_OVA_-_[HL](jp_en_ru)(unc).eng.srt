1
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,945
Fixed star diary, space calender 996.5.

2
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,577
After the research duty of
newly found mineral at Planet Kerun...

3
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:43,821
...we received an SOS
signal from cargo ship Zogne.

4
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:46,549
We were heading to
rescue the survivors right away...

5
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:51,155
There was no visible
damage on the Zogne's body, but...

6
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:52,890
...we had no response from the crew.

7
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,902
We had no clue
what had happened inside.

8
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:16,619
It's very quiet here.

9
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:18,854
Too quiet.

10
00:01:19,193 --> 00:01:20,660
It's like a ghost ship...

11
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:23,619
Hikari, how's the air quality?

12
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:26,461
Oxygen rate is normal, internal
operation system is normal, too.

13
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,865
Well then, no need for this
goofy space suit anymore.

14
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:32,269
No, we don't know
if this area is safe yet.

15
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:33,970
Hilda is right.

16
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,305
Watch out everyone.

17
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:38,335
Hilda, Kieth, Annie and Lindo...

18
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:40,972
...you guys continue
searching for the survivors.

19
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:43,808
Hikari and Yuri, you two work
on the main computer system.

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,707
Something must
have happened in this ship!

21
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:17,216
Sara, this is like haunted house.

22
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:18,982
It's so creepy.

23
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:20,850
I want to leave now!

24
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:24,049
Keep your squeaky voice down
and check out the cargo room!

25
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:25,658
Who do you think you are...

26
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:41,000
I can't take any more!

27
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:42,904
Is she alive?

28
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,907
No, raise the body.

29
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:48,739
What is this bruise?

30
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,275
It doesn't look like something natural.

31
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:53,678
Besides, what is this sticky liquid?

32
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:55,016
It's only on the women's bodies.

33
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:01,424
I can't take it anymore!

34
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:02,655
Everybody's dead!

35
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,527
Cut it out, what are you, six?

36
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:05,461
Come on.

37
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,626
We haven't checked
the other half of the ship.

38
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:11,728
No, no, I won't go anywhere!

39
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,030
What the hell...

40
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:17,772
Lindo, you can go
back to the docking gate.

41
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:18,709
Let's go.

42
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:21,103
No, this person is no good, too...

43
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:22,414
Really...

44
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:25,474
Maybe there isn't a single survivor.

45
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:27,520
What happened here...

46
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:31,350
Oh, it's a capsule...

47
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,517
This is...

48
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:34,316
Yuri...

49
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,260
What?

50
00:03:42,136 --> 00:03:43,797
Where did it come from?

51
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:45,002
It's terrible!

52
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:47,632
It's just like embryo in a bag.

53
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:49,866
It's too awful...

54
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:51,275
Hikari, Yuri, come here.

55
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,437
There's a survivor
in the cold sleep room.

56
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:54,173
Really?

57
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:55,808
Let's go.

58
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:17,098
It's a girl.

59
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:18,399
Her name is...

60
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:21,536
Flair Mytomeyer...

61
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:23,976
Is this girl alive?

62
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:24,601
Yes.

63
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:29,215
She is very beautiful...

64
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,381
Bring her to ICU now!

65
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:53,300
What the hell have
happened to the Zogne...

66
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,736
The girl we saved from
the Zogne is now conscious...

67
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:03,078
...and she has stabilized, but
she is suffering from amnesia.

68
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:03,840
What?

69
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,544
She has no memory at all?

70
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:06,580
Yes.

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,417
She doesn't even remember
her own name is Flair Mytomeyer.

72
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,985
What a poor girl...

73
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:14,892
So she doesn't know what
happened to the Zogne then?

74
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:15,788
Right...

75
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:17,558
Well that sucks!

76
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:18,825
At least she's happy!

77
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,161
Look who's talking.

78
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,099
Remember who was weeping
like a baby a few hours ago?

79
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:26,300
Hilda, you keep an eye
on that girl's condition.

80
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,440
Hikari, you analyze the
disk we got from the ship.

81
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:33,904
I actually for a while, but it
seems to be password protected.

82
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:34,913
No way!

83
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:37,007
The Zogne is just
regular cargo ship, isn't it?

84
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:38,016
That sounds like...

85
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:41,248
...they had some kind of special
task from the government, just like us.

86
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,219
That's true!

87
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:45,217
I am sure they were after something...

88
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:50,225
Oh, I found a capsule
of Metrogria in Zogne.

89
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:51,589
What!

90
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:52,962
Could it be?

91
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:57,504
Metrogria is synthetic destroyer
of regenerative cell systems, isn't it?

92
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,101
Production of it has also been banned.

93
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:01,965
Let's keep it in here.

94
00:06:02,743 --> 00:06:05,678
Then, is that the cause of the
death of the Zogne's crew members?

95
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:06,770
No, it's not.

96
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:09,445
Death from Metrogria is very different.

97
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,473
So you mean...

98
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:18,414
Hilda, you keep it, ok?

99
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:18,991
Yes.

100
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:31,332
My command is to destroy the Zogne
after releasing the connection to our ship.

101
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:32,461
What?

102
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:36,267
But, we still haven't found out
what happened on the Zogne yet.

103
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,070
To uncover the cause of
their death is not our main task.

104
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:45,646
But as the captain, the safety of all my
crew members is my top responsibility.

105
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:48,449
But we might still find
more survivors in there.

106
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:49,284
Absolutely!

107
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,952
There are humans there!

108
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:52,787
Let me go and search one more time!

109
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,724
It's not like you at all!

110
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:58,390
I am so touched, boo hoo!

111
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:02,865
Excuse me, but I am a humanist,
not a meat head like yourself!

112
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:05,368
Captain.

113
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:08,837
After one hour of rest,
we will move out quickly.

114
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:11,677
The time we have
is two hours and a half.

115
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:14,809
It should be enough
for us to set the bomb.

116
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:19,444
Something is
strange about Captain Sara.

117
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,087
Don't you think so, Einstein?

118
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:24,685
She seems to be
little upset or even scared...

119
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:29,223
Usually the Captain would do
more research on this kind of incident.

120
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:30,886
It's not like her at all.

121
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:37,262
No, not again!

122
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:39,168
You always want to hide in there!

123
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:44,638
No, it tickles!

124
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:49,070
Einstein!

125
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:52,379
Einstein!

126
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:55,549
What are you doing?

127
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:57,651
Good timing Yuri, help me here.

128
00:07:58,192 --> 00:08:00,820
Look what you're doing, shame on you!

129
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:03,658
B-But, it's because
Einstein got in my bra again!

130
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:04,962
Einstein!

131
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:06,121
Close the door!

132
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:11,093
Whoops, it was too late...

133
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:14,706
Now that he's out he
will be impossible to catch!

134
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:16,701
Sorry...

135
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,251
You are more passionate than usual...

136
00:08:32,593 --> 00:08:34,754
What's on your mind?

137
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:37,596
I can't hide anything from you.

138
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:40,898
I heard something before
and it's still bothering me.

139
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,969
I hope nothing bad will happen...

140
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:46,305
How is Flair's condition?

141
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:47,733
She's the same.

142
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:49,605
No, not there..

143
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,571
It's so good, I love you Sara.

144
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:58,147
I love you too, Hilda.

145
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:02,385
Let me do it now,
I'll make you forget everything.

146
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,223
Oh, no...

147
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,411
Hi there, Flair.

148
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,416
My name is Annie.

149
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:43,929
It's so sad,
you don't remember anything.

150
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,224
What beautiful hair you have.

151
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:55,974
I can be your special friend.

152
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,021
Are you there, Einstein?

153
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:27,066
Where the hell are you?

154
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:30,834
Einstein, come out, Einstein!

155
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:35,369
Annie?

156
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:39,106
Have you seen Einstein arou--

157
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,154
Hey, you Einstein, come here now!

158
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:54,123
Or I will punish you!

159
00:11:57,631 --> 00:12:01,226
Here you are, I was looking all over!

160
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:04,132
Hey, you're shaking.

161
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:07,740
Don't worry, I won't punish you.

162
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,241
We were still searching for the survivors,
even after all the explosives were set.

163
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:25,089
But all we found was room after
room of cruel, creepy dead bodies.

164
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:28,255
The ship was just
like a haunted ghost ship.

165
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:31,923
Okay, it's done.

166
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:33,559
How are you doing, Annie?

167
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:38,696
Annie!

168
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:45,702
What's wrong, Annie?

169
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:47,177
Everyone, come over here.

170
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:48,111
Something's wrong with Annie!

171
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:54,210
Annie!

172
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:01,359
It's terrible...

173
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:04,025
It's just like the Zogne's crew...

174
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:05,561
I can't believe it...

175
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:11,132
Sara, Annie is dead.

176
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:13,171
We don't know for sure...

177
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,441
...but the cause of death it seems
like whatever got the Zogne's crew.

178
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:17,903
What?

179
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:21,043
Everyone, return
to the Muse right away.

180
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:22,306
What about Annie's body?

181
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:24,149
Leave it there.

182
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:24,774
What?

183
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:25,340
Hurry up!

184
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:28,751
In twenty minutes,
we must detonate the Zogne.

185
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:43,200
Fixed star diary.

186
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,372
To protect our crew member's
safety and to destroy the Metrogria...

187
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:48,974
...we detonated the Zogne...

188
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:51,669
Our crew and I went
back to our normal lives.

189
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:57,314
But the fact is that we are all
still in shock from Annie's death.

190
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:14,397
Hey, you are working out really hard.

191
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:18,369
Maybe I can entertain you a little.

192
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:21,774
You want to get rid
of some stress, right?

193
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:26,439
Looking at your face makes me sick!

194
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:33,047
Oooh, that's scary,
that's why I hate butch types.

195
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,609
Your type never has a sense of humor.

196
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,097
Sorry.

197
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,328
I really have to work on this disc code.

198
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:52,266
I will play with you in a little while.

199
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,668
No, Einstein!

200
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:00,269
Did you see Flair?

201
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,405
No, is there anything wrong?

202
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:07,110
She stepped out when I
turned my back for a minute.

203
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:10,250
I hope she will return soon.

204
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:13,523
I will inform you if I see her.

205
00:15:14,828 --> 00:15:15,817
Please do...

206
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:22,667
Excuse me...

207
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:26,668
I like that.

208
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,173
You are really pretty.

209
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:30,166
Don't make fun of me like that.

210
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,003
Your hair is getting long.

211
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,842
Let me do your haircut next time.

212
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:44,047
Oh no, Einstein!

213
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:46,214
Einstein!

214
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:48,051
Where are you?

215
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:50,422
Einstein!

216
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,631
Einstein!

217
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:56,466
Where did you go?

218
00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:59,095
Einstein!

219
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,810
Hey, I found you Einstein.

220
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:07,975
Don't make me so worried.

221
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:10,213
Here, I got you!

222
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:14,986
What is this?

223
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:19,989
T-This is Metrogria!

224
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:21,755
Why is it here?

225
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:23,222
Who put it here?

226
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:34,371
Oh, it's you Flair.

227
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:36,304
What are you doing here?

228
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:37,866
Hilda was looking for you.

229
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:50,488
Oh, I am sorry.

230
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:53,890
Hey, be a good boy!

231
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:58,690
Since when did you
become such a bad boy, Einstein?

232
00:16:58,765 --> 00:16:59,459
Sorry...

233
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:03,364
Uh, Flair?

234
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:19,514
Who's there?

235
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:23,548
Flair?

236
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,050
Why are you here?

237
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,751
You got lost or something?

238
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:29,290
I will call Hilda for you.

239
00:18:04,097 --> 00:18:07,760
Why couldn't I move when I saw Flair?

240
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:12,468
Besides that, why Einstein
also got upset when he saw Flair?

241
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:15,767
Why is Metrogria on the ship?

242
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:19,640
I need to translate the disk.

243
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:10,762
Which one of us would
bring Metrogria onto the ship?

244
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,996
What's wrong, Hikari?

245
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:19,364
Nothing, I was just
wondering what happened to her...

246
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:20,665
Who?

247
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,336
Oh, Flair came back to medical
center and is sleeping like a baby now.

248
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:28,680
Um, isn't she hungry at all?

249
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:32,381
You are pretty concerned
about her, is she your type?

250
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:34,879
I just have
something I'm worried about...

251
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:37,151
See, you do care about her...

252
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,753
Hikari, how are you doing
with the translation of the disk?

253
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,153
It's not done yet.

254
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:46,459
I can't handle this by
myself so I asked for Elle's help.

255
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:47,833
Also Captain...

256
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:49,027
Can we talk later?

257
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:56,203
You look pale, Kieth.

258
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,208
Are you sick?

259
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,915
You are always the first
one to come for the meal.

260
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,643
It's once in a blue
moon that you aren't here...

261
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:14,424
Kieth?

262
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:17,121
Kieth, what's wrong?

263
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:17,924
Are you--

264
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:35,608
What's really going on with you, Kieth...

265
00:20:44,424 --> 00:20:46,949
Take her to the medical room for now.

266
00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:54,298
What happened to Kieth anyway?

267
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,698
I have no idea...

268
00:20:56,469 --> 00:20:58,494
How's Flair doing?

269
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:00,099
Nothing special.

270
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:05,610
But after she went out
yesterday, she looked little tired.

271
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:08,846
I suppose she is
not fully recovered yet.

272
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:13,116
Well, it's time to take
care of another patient.

273
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:19,088
Will this help?

274
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:22,792
When Kieth wakes up,
she's going to go wild again.

275
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:34,403
What did you want
to talk about with Sara?

276
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:37,505
There is Metrogria on this ship!

277
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:38,407
No kidding!

278
00:21:38,478 --> 00:21:39,877
I saw it in the cargo room.

279
00:21:40,046 --> 00:21:40,705
I'm positive.

280
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,009
But, who brought it in here...

281
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,474
I have no idea...

282
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,312
Hikari...

283
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:49,983
I finished the
translation of the Zogne's data.

284
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,924
Thank you Elle, I am on my way.

285
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,527
Now that should answer our questions!

286
00:21:56,663 --> 00:22:01,100
I will inform Sara about this,
you go the computer room first.

287
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:02,064
Okay!

288
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:02,930
Come with me!

289
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,274
K-Kieth, what's going on?

290
00:22:15,415 --> 00:22:16,814
Unbelievable!

291
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:18,475
Hilda, is there a gun here?

292
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:19,745
It's in the drawer.

293
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,489
I will draw her attention.

294
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:26,852
You get the gun.

295
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:28,257
I can't!

296
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:42,198
Hilda, the gun, get the gun...

297
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:43,800
No, no...

298
00:22:44,844 --> 00:22:47,540
Kieth, stop it, Kieth...

299
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:52,040
The gun is in the drawer...

300
00:22:57,323 --> 00:23:01,225
Kieth, stop it now or I'll have to...

301
00:23:15,408 --> 00:23:16,432
Kieth...

302
00:23:18,578 --> 00:23:22,275
Kieth, why did this happen...

303
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:25,973
What?

304
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:32,622
Flair, was that you...

305
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:43,934
Kieth, Annie and the Zogne's crew...

306
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:46,130
Did you kill them all, Flair?

307
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,810
What the hell is this?

308
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,374
No way...

309
00:23:58,651 --> 00:24:00,414
Elle, give me the data on the Zogne.

310
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:08,151
We, the Zogne, were waiting for
contact from another space ship, the Muse.

311
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:12,160
The Metrogria had already
been moved from Fenkel.

312
00:24:12,832 --> 00:24:17,826
But along the way we rescued it,
and our ship was turned into living hell.

313
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:20,699
It was some kind of monster.

314
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:37,587
It's a monster!

315
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:45,890
It is just like a parasite,
hatching eggs in other bodies.

316
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:53,805
The woman sucked the life from the male
crew members and grew into a monster.

317
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,368
Stop it, monster!

318
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:09,645
And then she laid her eggs in
the female crew member's bodies.

319
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:23,597
However, all of their bodies
rejected the eggs and ended up dying.

320
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:25,398
We must destroy her soon.

321
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:26,603
What?

322
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:28,503
I have to report to the Captain.

323
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:30,866
Stop!

324
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:40,046
Oh, no, no...

325
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:49,752
Sara, Hilda...

326
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,461
No!

327
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:13,042
If Sara and Hilda are in the medical
room, it's going to be big trouble.

328
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:15,087
I really have to tell
everybody about Flair!

329
00:26:18,691 --> 00:26:19,715
What happened Yuri?

330
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:23,824
It's scary, there's a
monster in the medical room.

331
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:24,590
A monster?

332
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:25,756
And also Hilda...

333
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:27,192
It must be Flair.

334
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:28,995
Now she is showing her true nature.

335
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:30,296
And what happened to everybody...

336
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:31,336
I don't know...

337
00:26:31,404 --> 00:26:33,770
I was chased by
tentacles and ran away...

338
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,767
Anyway, we must beat Flair.

339
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,273
Flair?

340
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,704
I'll explain later...

341
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:41,508
Now we have to beat Flair
and help Hilda and the others.

342
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:42,273
Let's go!

343
00:26:42,882 --> 00:26:45,476
You always skip the important part...

344
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,485
How are you going to beat that thing?

345
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:51,022
It is definitely not a normal creature.

346
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,886
I don't know yet, but there must be
some kind of weapons in the cargo bay.

347
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,758
So, what you were saying
about the monster was?

348
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:58,660
Flair is the monster.

349
00:26:58,731 --> 00:27:00,858
She killed the crew of the Zogne.

350
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:02,525
So if we don't terminate her...

351
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,899
Our ship will end up
just like the Zogne did.

352
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:08,005
Okay!

353
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:09,708
Ready?

354
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,508
I am ready.

355
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,750
I will open the door now.

356
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:26,291
All right.

357
00:27:29,762 --> 00:27:30,319
What?

358
00:27:30,396 --> 00:27:31,761
The monster and Hilda are gone...

359
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:33,326
What's going on?

360
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:34,626
Where did they go?

361
00:27:35,201 --> 00:27:36,566
Someone's over there!

362
00:27:37,036 --> 00:27:38,333
K-Kieth...

363
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:40,369
She's been shot.

364
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:42,631
Look, there's the mark on her belly...

365
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:51,715
Hilda, are you all right?

366
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:57,786
What are you doing?

367
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,857
Stop, Hilda!

368
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:19,669
Don't shoot!

369
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:32,452
Oxygen rate in residential
area, decreasing rapidly...

370
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:37,355
Einstein, keep your head inside!

371
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,230
Emergency outer wall,
residential area wall closing now...

372
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,235
Oxygen rate normal.

373
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:53,743
Why did it happen?

374
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,543
I won't forgive that Flair monster.

375
00:28:58,217 --> 00:28:59,684
What happened to Hilda?

376
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:02,379
Let's go back to the bridge and ask Elle.

377
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:08,558
Elle, check all vital signs on the ship

378
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:09,490
Roger.

379
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:11,220
Results are on screen.

380
00:29:13,132 --> 00:29:19,799
In D-2 cargo block, two vital
signs and in E-2 block, one vital sign.

381
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:21,264
Where should we go?

382
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,207
Lindo and Sara must be in D-2 block.

383
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:25,300
Okay, let's get there.

384
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:32,011
Elle, shut the
emergency doors as I instructed.

385
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:32,742
Understood.

386
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,047
Let's go!

387
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,944
We need to get extra
weapons on the way.

388
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:42,816
Here we go...

389
00:29:43,295 --> 00:29:45,525
Sara, Lindo.

390
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:48,263
Captain, Lindo!

391
00:29:57,576 --> 00:29:59,305
It sounds like Sara.

392
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:05,578
C-Captain, is that you?

393
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:14,759
S-Sara!

394
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:18,721
Your face!

395
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:22,832
That monster can't be
beaten by any weapon.

396
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:27,562
Escape from this ship now!

397
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,840
It's awful!

398
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:41,847
What the hell is that?

399
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:43,416
It must be Flair.

400
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:45,555
Eat this!

401
00:30:49,495 --> 00:30:50,462
Now, run!

402
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:59,633
Elle, Lock up the
safety door on D block!

403
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:06,405
Lockdown completed.

404
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:09,413
That was close, thanks Elle.

405
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:12,613
This door can hold for a while.

406
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:18,155
Let's go now.

407
00:31:18,557 --> 00:31:19,956
To where?

408
00:31:20,426 --> 00:31:22,724
Lindo must be in E block.

409
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:25,589
After finding her,
we must escape from here.

410
00:31:25,898 --> 00:31:27,456
What about Flair?

411
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,068
Sara, Hilda and Kieth,
everybody was killed by her.

412
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:34,999
I must destroy Flair.

413
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:37,005
But how?

414
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:38,167
What did Sara say?

415
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:39,734
No weapon can beat it.

416
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:42,112
There must be some way!

417
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:42,942
Let's go.

418
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:46,384
Hikari, hurry!

419
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:01,856
Is that you Lindo?

420
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:02,992
Shit!

421
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:05,534
Lindo, you are alive!

422
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:08,562
Hey guys, what are you doing here?

423
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:10,268
You didn't know
about the Captain and--

424
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:11,001
Don't move!

425
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:14,810
Lindo...

426
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,370
Have you also been...

427
00:32:16,882 --> 00:32:18,975
What are you talking about?

428
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:20,984
You are not...

429
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:23,619
Wait, the place she is standing...

430
00:32:24,556 --> 00:32:25,181
What's that?

431
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:26,219
This?

432
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,452
It's Metrogria.

433
00:32:27,793 --> 00:32:30,728
So, you are the one who
brought it from the Zogne!

434
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:31,659
That's right!

435
00:32:31,764 --> 00:32:33,595
Well, drop your guns.

436
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:35,265
Don't be a fool.

437
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:39,970
The monster's in our
ship and it killed everybody!

438
00:32:40,205 --> 00:32:41,763
What monster?

439
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:45,069
You remember Flair, she is the monster.

440
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,201
She also killed the Zogne's crew!

441
00:32:49,148 --> 00:32:52,242
Do you think I will buy such crap?

442
00:32:52,451 --> 00:32:53,941
Don't fool with me!

443
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:55,680
It's true, believe us!

444
00:32:55,754 --> 00:32:57,244
It's not a lie!

445
00:32:58,657 --> 00:33:03,253
Well, if that's true, that
saves me from killing you all.

446
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:04,720
Drop your guns!

447
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:12,094
What are you going to do?

448
00:33:12,371 --> 00:33:14,396
Just go back to the original plan.

449
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:15,906
Original plan?

450
00:33:16,108 --> 00:33:20,169
I am taking over this ship and
waiting for the buyer of the Metrogria.

451
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:21,902
Are you going to take over the Muse?

452
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:24,675
I was freaked out about
what happened at Zogne.

453
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:28,011
The Muse was supposed to
send an SOS message to the Zogne...

454
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:31,745
...and they were going to take over
the Muse when we went to rescue them.

455
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:34,685
After all, our ship
belongs to the government.

456
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:40,254
That makes it easy to smuggle
this Metrogria over the border.

457
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:44,200
Do you have any idea how Metrogria
can be used to kill other people?

458
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:47,194
That's none of my business.

459
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:48,505
What?

460
00:33:48,574 --> 00:33:49,506
I can't let you do it!

461
00:33:51,944 --> 00:33:55,209
You don't do anything funny...

462
00:33:55,514 --> 00:33:57,038
If you do, I'll...

463
00:33:59,718 --> 00:34:00,548
What the hell is that?

464
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,281
It broke through the emergency door!

465
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:04,817
Monster, go to hell!

466
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:34,211
Stop, Flair!

467
00:34:34,453 --> 00:34:35,385
Shit!

468
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:37,579
Take this!

469
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,894
It doesn't work at all!

470
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:47,288
Sara was right, let's get out of here.

471
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:58,165
Sister!

472
00:34:58,977 --> 00:34:59,966
My leg...

473
00:35:09,755 --> 00:35:12,519
I can't get it off, shit!

474
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:16,188
You can't, just leave me here.

475
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:18,426
No, I can't leave you!

476
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:20,287
Hikari...

477
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:23,194
I will save you...

478
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:31,640
Hikari, it's okay...

479
00:35:36,415 --> 00:35:37,746
...you escape now.

480
00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:02,237
Let her go!

481
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:04,070
I will get you free, I will...

482
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:06,073
If we can get out of the room, it
will be cut off by the edge of the door.

483
00:36:06,178 --> 00:36:09,545
No...

484
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:10,710
Don't try to save
me, you just run away.

485
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:14,009
Hurry!

486
00:36:14,286 --> 00:36:16,117
No, we have to go together!

487
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:18,155
I will save you, sis, I will!

488
00:36:18,957 --> 00:36:20,618
I just have to save you.

489
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:23,453
Thank you, Hikari.
But you should just go without me...

490
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:26,655
I can't just leave here, I can't!

491
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:29,363
I will take you with me!

492
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:31,431
I'll definitely save you!

493
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,723
Hikari, go now!

494
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:57,759
Sis!

495
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,396
No!

496
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:10,597
Sister Yuri...

497
00:37:13,512 --> 00:37:14,410
Sister...

498
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:23,647
I can't forgive you...

499
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:24,987
I'll never...

500
00:37:26,325 --> 00:37:27,257
...forgive you.

501
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:30,488
I will destroy you!

502
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:33,490
Elle, open all the
safety doors in the hallway.

503
00:37:33,632 --> 00:37:34,724
Opening now.

504
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,434
But, how am I going to fight with that?

505
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:43,106
There must be
something, something strong...

506
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:43,869
Let's see...

507
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:45,676
Yes, the Metrogria.

508
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,609
With this Metrogria...

509
00:38:12,371 --> 00:38:15,465
To shoot this, I am going to
have to get close to the Alien.

510
00:38:22,347 --> 00:38:25,077
When I beat it,
I will play with you again.

511
00:38:25,851 --> 00:38:27,409
So, wait for me.

512
00:38:32,257 --> 00:38:33,690
You wait for me, alien!

513
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:44,026
Here I am, alien.

514
00:38:44,503 --> 00:38:46,095
You want me, right?

515
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:50,836
Fine, but I want my sister back now!

516
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:54,541
Lindo...

517
00:38:55,547 --> 00:38:56,946
Where is Yuri?

518
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:02,376
What happened to Yuri?

519
00:39:03,922 --> 00:39:06,049
You did your thing to the other girl?

520
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:10,553
Now you want to
do it to me, don't you?

521
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:11,459
Well, come here.

522
00:39:16,468 --> 00:39:19,801
You are getting closer, almost there.

523
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:22,298
Now!

524
00:39:37,456 --> 00:39:39,185
No!

525
00:39:41,893 --> 00:39:43,793
Leave me, let me go!

526
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:45,752
What are you going to do?

527
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:50,128
No, no!

528
00:39:50,936 --> 00:39:52,836
No, no!

529
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,310
If I could just shoot it...

530
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:15,017
Einstein!

531
00:40:50,195 --> 00:40:56,862
Captain, Kieth, Lindo,
Hilda and my sister's revenge!

532
00:41:06,044 --> 00:41:06,908
Gotcha!

533
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:17,047
Come on, Einstein...

534
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:19,621
We must get out of here before
the Metrogria gets into the air.

535
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:34,832
I am sorry, sis.

536
00:41:46,184 --> 00:41:51,087
Air level dropping, oxygen level
dropping, emergency door sealing...

537
00:42:19,818 --> 00:42:20,944
Sister...

538
00:45:07,452 --> 00:45:08,214
Who is it?

539
00:45:09,954 --> 00:45:11,251
Sister!

540
00:45:17,562 --> 00:45:18,654
You are alive!

541
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:19,719
Thank god!

542
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:21,755
Sister!
