1
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,280
I just... can't go on.

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,290
My name... and my memories are gone!

3
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,870
I get the feeling I've been
sleeping for quite some time.

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,170
Who in the world am I!?

5
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,470
Someone tell me!

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,930
Sorry to keep you waiting, Master.

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,260
Who are you?

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,220
I am Ren.

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,690
I am your loyal slave, Master.

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,150
"Master..."

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,400
Is that my name?

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,690
A name?

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,030
A name is merely a means to
reduce you, all-powerful Master.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,490
If you need an example, the next
world is full of foolish humans.

15
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,740
"Foolish humans..."

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,250
Then what am I?

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,620
The most powerful Devil in the universe.

18
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,580
Ruler of chaos and fear.

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,540
And destroyer of all things.

20
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,920
A-All those you're calling me seem to be really nasty.

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,970
Would you like to see yourself7

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,520
BEYOND - Episode 1
Awakening Satan, the Devil

23
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,030
What in the world is this form?

24
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,790
Please calm yourself.

25
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,250
When you fell asleep last time,
your powers were sealed off.

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,170
You're confused because you woke up just recently.

27
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,000
"Sealed," you say?

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,670
If we can break the seal, we can
regain your soul Master.

29
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,430
What must we do?

30
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,760
This!

31
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,140
H-Hey!

32
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,240
Master, please do my bidding.

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm the key to breaking your seal Master.

34
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,930
So this will release my power?

35
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,880
Ouch!

36
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,250
What was that sudden shock?

37
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,050
Captain!

38
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,420
A space undulation, one with
frightening gravity waves!

39
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,300
I think it might be an inter-dimensional tremor!

40
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,720
An inter-dimensional tremor, you say?

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,680
There might be a UFO near the origin of the blast.

42
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,390
Investigate!

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,680
Another blast is coming!

44
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,060
Brace for attack!

45
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,820
Captain, we're getting a distress signal from the base.

46
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,070
Relaying to the main screen!

47
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,190
Admiral!

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,990
It's an emergency situation, Captain Eva.

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,370
So it was that blast we just experienced.

50
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,030
Correct.

51
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,040
In that case, we'll send an away
team to investigate at once!

52
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,080
Wait.

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,700
Return to base immediately.

54
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,960
It's just been announced that the entire
universe has felt an abnormal burst of energy.

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,090
It's a huge crisis for the entire universe.

56
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,460
What do you mean?

57
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,420
The Devil has awakened.

58
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,630
You mean the Dark Devil?

59
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,760
But that's just a myth.

60
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,600
That's what most people believe,
but he really does exist.

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,680
He's revived after thousands of years of sleep,

62
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,560
to unleash his thorough and merciless
destruction on everything, and then disappear.

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,570
When he awakens from his sleep, the first
sign is an inter-dimensional reaction.

64
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,780
An inter-dimensional reaction...

65
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,450
Then we need to investigate even more!

66
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,240
I understand your sense of urgency,

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,780
but we mustn't underestimate the Dark Devil.

68
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,330
You must return to base on Ratol.

69
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,410
I want you to be present at the council meeting.

70
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,460
Very well, sir.

71
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,790
"When the Devil awakens,

72
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,050
the universe will fall into a sea of agonizing fear."

73
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,630
So the myth is real.

74
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,880
As per orders,

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,970
setting a course for Ratol!

76
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,930
Wait!

77
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,180
We mustn't disobey orders.

78
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,010
I haven't even suggested that yet!

79
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,970
But you mustn't disobey orders.

80
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,930
I haven't disobeyed yet though!

81
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,190
Ever since we were kids, I've been
able to see through you, Eva.

82
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,240
We will not attempt to deal with the inter-
dimensional waves without permission!

83
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,030
And who's in charge of this ship?

84
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,620
That's the captain.

85
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,990
And who's the captain?

86
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,870
Eh? You, of course.

87
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,500
Then, here's an order from the captain.

88
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,960
Tell the base that we're going to investigate the
inter-dimensional reaction waves on our own!

89
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,460
Eva!

90
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,630
This is your captain speaking!

91
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,880
If the myth really is true, then the
universe will be destroyed.

92
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,300
If there's a way we can stop it...

93
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,510
Full speed ahead!

94
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,180
Eva...

95
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,730
What sensations...

96
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,190
My powers...

97
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,660
My powers are flowing within me!

98
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,540
I'm... I'm cumming!

99
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,230
Another inter-dimensional reaction wave spotted!

100
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,560
Detecting a second-level wave directed at the fleet!

101
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,970
Beautiful...

102
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,010
Where are we?

103
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,350
I see that the seal has been broken, Master.

104
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,770
That was just a small sample of your power.

105
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,600
My power?

106
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,440
Yes. Putting it in more complicated terms,

107
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,740
the Giselle Sanctuary and the Etruria Galaxy
have been completely destroyed.

108
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,780
Very well done.

109
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,240
"Destroyed" you say?

110
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,410
This is a three-dimensional space.

111
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,870
And 7000 years ago, when you fell into your sleep,

112
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,710
you were at the bottom of this planet's dimension.

113
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,830
That doesn't exactly explain anything.

114
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,300
You were able to escape from the
seal in that dimension, however,

115
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,670
and erupt into the third dimension right here.

116
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,680
The destruction of a couple of galaxies...

117
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,850
is a small price to pay for the revival of your strength.

118
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:37,060
And after all, Master, your destiny
is to destroy existence.

119
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,980
So you mean to say that countless
lives were lost just then?

120
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,070
Exactly, Master.

121
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,530
What a horrible thing!

122
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,700
I'm such an evil person!

123
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,320
Why are you so troubled?

124
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,240
I'm done.

125
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,200
Why is that?

126
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,750
Because I've done something evil...

127
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,580
that I cant take back!

128
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,460
I don't really understand what you're saying.

129
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,670
Your name was Ren-san, right?

130
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,260
Don't you have any empathy for living beings?

131
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,390
Master, I am your slave.

132
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,770
Please do away with the honorifics.

133
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,680
Don't avoid my question.

134
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,560
But I don't understand the word "empathy."

135
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,190
Empathy is...

136
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,900
Right!

137
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,490
It's love.

138
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,280
And "love"... What's that?

139
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,660
Well this sweet-and-sour thing
boils up in your chest and...

140
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,960
It's a bad thing, I see.

141
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,710
No, it's a very precious feeling in your heart, when
someone is more important to you than anything else.

142
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,420
In that case, I love you.

143
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,840
You are more important to me than anything else.

144
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,010
Hmm, I don't think that's quite right!

145
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,640
Master, are you all right?

146
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,230
A-Anyway! How about I show
you over time what it means?

147
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,690
Okay. Very well.

148
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,360
Please teach me anything you wish.

149
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,320
Well for starters, put on some clothes!

150
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,860
Yes.

151
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,910
She's almost like a doll.

152
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,080
How long has our relationship been this way?

153
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,790
One thing is certain. I can't
tolerate not knowing who I am.

154
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,790
Like I said, you are the Master of Fear and Destruction.

155
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,300
Can't you call me something other than that?

156
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,670
Master, on the various planets,
you've been known by many names.

157
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,180
It started as legend, then became myth,

158
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,260
then was relayed orally from generation to generation.

159
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,190
I see. So perhaps that might be a
hint to discover my true identity.

160
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,190
Ren, lend me your power.

161
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,230
Okay.

162
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,530
There's another three-hour wait before
the next inter-galactic transport?

163
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,240
Teleporting would be much swifter.

164
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,740
Teleporting? I wish to travel the normal way, though.

165
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,710
Where is the liveliest place close to here?

166
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,330
Koike Colony.

167
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,790
There are many different kinds of people there.

168
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,630
I think you'll be able to hear the myths very quickly.

169
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,510
Good. By the way, it seems we
need money to ride a ship.

170
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,680
Can you take care of that?

171
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,090
Yes.

172
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,770
First the mirror now this.

173
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,640
How in the world does she do it?

174
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,690
Teleporting matter.

175
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,110
I teleported the money from
somewhere else on this planet.

176
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,940
Very impressive.

177
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,650
Thank you very much.

178
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,610
Receiving your praise is the source
of all happiness for me.

179
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,870
Oh, could this be love?

180
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,120
Urn, I think it's a bit different than that.

181
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,090
A 300-year salary hold?

182
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,600
You can't be serious.

183
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,060
The Council made this decision.

184
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,520
Wh-What do you mean by this, Admiral?

185
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,480
Your mistake was too enormous.

186
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,070
I understand, sir.

187
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,980
Losing the ship was my fault.

188
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,780
But-

189
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,070
The issue is not the ship!

190
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,450
There's something else?

191
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,410
After that blast destroyed your ship, seven
other planets were also destroyed.

192
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,040
Five in this sector!

193
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,960
The Etruria Galaxy was destroyed.

194
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,170
And more... and more... and more!

195
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,130
Admiral...

196
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,090
All the affected nations have
sent us bills for damages!

197
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,130
LOOK!

198
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,130
And you say that's my responsibility?

199
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,010
Until we find the Devils hideout
we have no choice but to help.

200
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,140
No way! Have mercy!

201
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,350
The Council has ordered your salary stopped
for eternity, until you've repaid all the losses.

202
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,690
You'll be demoted to the lowest position possible.

203
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,190
In other words, you'll be the lowest
rank for the rest of your life.

204
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,400
Though it's a miracle that you
haven't been fired over this.

205
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,740
It's a mystery!

206
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,330
Captain! How did your talk with the Admiral go?

207
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,540
Great I guess.

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,540
At least I wasn't fired.

209
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,670
Captain, you must fight! Fight!

210
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,430
I'll always be here to cheer you on!

211
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,010
Fight on!

212
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,010
The Devil... that's right.

213
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,180
Everything is his fault.

214
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,650
This vendetta of mine...

215
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,480
will go on!

216
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,290
I see what you mean.

217
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,450
Looks like I'll get many different perspectives here.

218
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,880
I'll go find a warrior befitting your quest.

219
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,630
In the meantime, here's your per diem.

220
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,300
Oh, thanks.

221
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,130
Well, I'll see you later!

222
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,800
It's a good thing she has spirit.

223
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,970
Well, then...

224
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,180
Um, excuse me.

225
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,940
Yes?

226
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,230
Umm...

227
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,150
Yes?

228
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,150
Umm...

229
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,990
Oh, no! I was just trying to talk to her!

230
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,080
I must clear up this misunderstanding.

231
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, no!

232
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,720
Now then...

233
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,280
Well, there were many fewer casualties
this time, so I'll consider it a blessing.

234
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,010
I think I'm lost.

235
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,440
I'm starving.

236
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,820
Package!

237
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,400
Thanks.

238
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,200
Roze! It's from Roze!

239
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,080
"Captain, how are you?"

240
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,330
"I wanted to help you out..."

241
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,830
<i>"so I got you this present"</i>

242
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,790
<i>"made it myself I hope you like it."</i>

243
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,260
<i>"I'm taking care of things on the
space end, so don't worry."</i>

244
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,050
<i>"We'll, I'll contact you again soon."</i>

245
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,050
<i>"Roze."</i>

246
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,390
Thank you, Roze!

247
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,180
I'll bet she sent some homemade food!

248
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,770
Yummy...

249
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,730
Roze, I don't think this will fill me up.

250
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,730
Umm, I wish to speak to someone.

251
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,990
Yeah. What is it?

252
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,860
I seem to have lost my way.

253
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,950
But there are plenty of...

254
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,240
Ah! Where are you going, sir?

255
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,410
If you wish, I'll accompany you.

256
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,380
What a relief. She's a nice cop.

257
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,430
A pretty female like you is the only
cop in this desolate place?

258
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,100
It must be tough.

259
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Well, sorta.

260
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,850
If I were a woman, I'd never work
in a wasteland like this.

261
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,150
It cant be helped. I've been demoted.

262
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,730
Demoted?

263
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,650
Yes. You've heard of the Dark Devil, right?

264
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,070
Yeah.

265
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,450
Thanks to that asshole, lots of planets were destroyed.

266
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,410
And they made me take the blame for it.

267
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,920
Something the matter, sir?

268
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,840
Umm, well...

269
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,380
Don't pity me.

270
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,810
Even if I was demoted to the lowest
position at the lowest pay,

271
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,270
I'm still one hell of a cop!

272
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,390
And I take pride in my work.

273
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,100
Umm, well, actually I...

274
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,530
Please, be my guest and eat.

275
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,070
But I...

276
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,240
I insist!

277
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,120
Thank you!

278
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,040
Eat up, eat up. Is it good?

279
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,870
Yes, very.

280
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,870
Th-Thats great.

281
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,010
Um, Ms. Cop?

282
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,930
I don't know who you are or where you're
from, but I'm eternally grateful!

283
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,640
I haven't eaten anything for two days straight.

284
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,140
I was just trying to make up for what I did.

285
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,600
You don't need to thank me.

286
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,890
It's my duty as a cop to help you.

287
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,980
Sorry! It wasn't enough?

288
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,570
You need more to eat.

289
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,820
Hey! Gather all the food you can muster
and give it to this poor cop!

290
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,240
Thank you! Thank you!

291
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,200
Satisfied? Satisfied?

292
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,170
Right now I'm so happy!

293
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,180
Good morning.

294
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,680
Did I...

295
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,690
No need to worry.

296
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,900
You just had indigestion from
eatin too much too quickly.

297
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,230
I got you some medicine, so everything is all right.

298
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,530
How much did it cost?

299
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,110
Your sickness was my fault anyway. I should pay for it.

300
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,830
I hope you don't mind, but I decided to help
you out around the house a little bit.

301
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,380
You work so hard every day.

302
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,220
Are you hungry again?

303
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,050
No. I don't know who you are or where you're from,

304
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,390
but I'm very grateful.

305
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,310
I've just never been treated with such kindness before.

306
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,690
Well it was the human thing to do.

307
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,190
Uh, w-wait..

308
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,440
I've never met anyone as sweet as you.

309
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,400
Umm, but Ms. Cop, I...

310
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,740
Call me Eva.

311
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,620
I decided long ago that I would save
my first time for someone like you.

312
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,580
E-Eva?

313
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,540
Please, make love to me.

314
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,250
Eva!

315
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,960
Make love to me. For me!

316
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,340
Eva!

317
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Come closer.

318
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,580
It hurts.

319
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,400
Fast. Before I even came.

320
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,120
She must've been very lonely.

321
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,450
Master?

322
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,250
Master!

323
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,920
Ren, is that you?

324
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,630
Where are you?

325
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,380
Even I don't know that.

326
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,840
I'm currently at the farthest away point.

327
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,090
I received your location through telepathy,

328
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,350
so I'll return to you shortly.

329
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Wait! This place is dangerous
for an unaccompanied girl.

330
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,690
I'll come to you, Ren.

331
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,980
Guide me.

332
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,810
Understood.

333
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,540
Master!

334
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,960
Ren.

335
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,710
What a relief to see that you're well.

336
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,420
Sorry I worried you.

337
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,510
I was just helping someone out.

338
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,050
Helping someone out?

339
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,220
Could that possibly be because of that
"empathy" you spoke of the other day?

340
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,190
W-Well, I suppose so.

341
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,640
Is that so?

342
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,440
Well, how was your progress on researching myths?

343
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,110
Damn! I completely forgot!

344
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,280
Master?

345
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,950
I want to see her again.

346
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,910
Who am I talking about?

347
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,970
So my knight in shining armor did this.

348
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,980
My prince!

and we believe he is in hiding.

from various surveillance cameras.

No way.

356
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,180
It's him.

357
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,390
It's him!

358
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,110
He's the Dark Devil?

359
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,650
Are you fucking kidding me?

360
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,400
Give me... Give me...

361
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,570
Give me back my virginity!

I won't let you escape!

365

You're fucking dead.

366
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,400
Fucking dead, fucking dead, fucking dead!

367
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,110
I'll chase you as far as I have to,
even to the end of the galaxy!

368
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,150
I vow...

369
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,570
I vow to capture you!
