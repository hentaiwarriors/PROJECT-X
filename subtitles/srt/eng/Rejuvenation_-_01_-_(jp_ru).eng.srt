Not for sale, rent or ebay.

2
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,520
Master Shingo...

3
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,690
The pot has been filled.

4
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,370
I believe it has been a fruitful night.

5
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,530
There.

6
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,970
What's your plan for lunch?

7
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,910
I noticed a new pasta place
opened up near you.

8
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,380
I'll meet you in the basement
level of the Mega Mall.

9
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,840
That Atsuko...

10
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,260
Oh, Kei! Are you heading
out on a date now?

11
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,720
Wow, I'm so envious!

12
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,690
You bet!

13
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,630
I hope you find a good
man sometime soon, Jun.

14
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,220
And not just on the lnternet.

15
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,730
I'm impressed, Atsuko. That you'd
notice such an out-of-the-way place.

16
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,110
So, are you impressed with the
investigative abilities of us at lCPO?

17
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,250
Oh, we'll have two ''Specials''.

18
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,450
And I'll have an iced coffee
to drink and...

19
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,040
I'll have an espresso.

20
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,760
Fantastic!

21
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,820
I've been so busy lately I haven't
been eating anything good.

22
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,300
Have you been working on
that job they're talking about?

23
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,230
Yes. The multiple international
simultaneous rape incidents!

24
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,700
Atsuko!

25
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,800
Oh, darn. I wasn't
supposed to tell you that.

26
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,010
Well, anyway...
That's the story. Sorry.

27
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,240
Sorry I've ignored you for so long.

28
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,710
I'll be sure to make it up to you.

29
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,650
Don't you cheat on me.

30
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,450
Of course I won't.

31
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,020
So, haven't there been any
leads or anything yet?

32
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,990
We've got a witness.

33
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,500
So far all of the victims
have been killed.

34
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,200
But one survived from
an incident the other day.

35
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,940
It turns out the culprit
was the victim's lover.

36
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,280
She was attacked while he was
taking her home after a date.

37
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,920
What?! You mean like a
wolf committing a date rape?!

38
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,160
Bingo!

39
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,130
That's very good.

40
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,490
You were even right
about the wolf part.

41
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,110
Let's see you move!

42
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,980
Now, raise those legs higher!

43
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,700
Um, are you all right?

44
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,280
No!

45
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,210
Do it.

46
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,080
I guess these pills don't work either.

47
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,420
Kenji, the doctor said you must be
patient with the treatment.

48
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,960
But that'll take too long!

49
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,430
If I don't recover and get
back to my running, I'll be...

50
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,040
Shit!

51
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,130
Kenji...

52
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,510
Yuko...

53
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,950
Kenji!

54
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,430
There's something weird
going on with me today...

55
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,960
Kenji...

56
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,030
Kenji...

57
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,040
What do you think, Mari?

58
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,680
Yes. This is the list of subjects.

59
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,760
I've been disseminating the
test drug over a wider area...

60
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,020
to keep the authorities
from noticing.

61
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,730
And based on the follow up...

62
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,030
the effects were
noticeable two days...

63
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,130
after the subjects
had taken the test drug.

64
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
In each case,
the responses are irregular...

65
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,370
and all loose ends
have been dealt with.

66
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,730
It's just that...

67
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,380
Are you saying that
this schedule is too tight?

68
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,980
There's a pressing demand to
complete it as quickly as possible.

69
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,750
I'll go have a word with them.

70
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,460
Not now! We're on patrol!

71
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,270
Why not?

72
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,070
It's been a while since
we've been together like this.

73
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,270
But still...

74
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,190
There's people around...

75
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,490
No one's going to bother us
this late at night.

76
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,820
Besides, no one could
see us in this darkness.

77
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,430
Oh, Atsuko...

78
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,540
Uh, not there...!

79
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,870
What do you mean?
Look how wet you are!

80
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,040
You're such a tease!

81
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,850
I can't help but tease you,
because you're so adorable.

82
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,760
Atsuko!

83
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,000
It's about time you stopped resisting.

84
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,740
I'll give you all the pleasure you want.

85
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,470
How are you feeling?

86
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,680
Those pills I bought
on the lnternet sure work!

87
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,200
I can't believe I was feeling
so sick until yesterday.

88
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,340
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

89
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,190
What's the matter?

90
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,670
W-Wait!

91
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,690
Hang on, Atsuko!

92
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,080
What the hell is this?

93
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,620
Why, you.
Bastard!

94
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,840
Atsuko!

95
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,850
Kei!

96
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,420
Hold it, you bastard!

97
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,940
How strange.

98
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,600
You sure he went this way?

99
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,600
Atsuko, look.

100
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,540
What the...?

101
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,060
That took a while.

102
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,260
I'm very sorry.

103
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,500
I got caught up in
dealing with the subjects.

104
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,060
And what about the drug?
Not ready yet?

105
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,140
Unfortunately not.

106
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,040
Then why did you come here?

107
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,410
You'd better get back to your work.

108
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,550
Something has happened
that keeps me from continuing.

109
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,650
A spy has infiltrated our work.
We have a loose cannon somewhere.

110
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,320
I'd like to postpone further
experiments for a while.

111
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,660
No.

112
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,500
Unlike you, we don't
have much time left.

113
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,060
I understand.

114
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,290
This is the only good subject
we have discovered so far.

115
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,760
His name is Kenji Naruse.

116
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,930
I don't remember seeing
his name on the list.

117
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,450
I didn't find him through
the usual routes.

118
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,130
Which means?

119
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:23,840
I got a report about missing
samples of a test drug from a lab.

120
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,430
I found out the subject took the drug
from the firm without permission.

121
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,710
So you took longer in discovering him.

122
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,710
Keep a good eye on him.

123
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:48,400
It seems that you've
forgotten something.

124
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,260
Pardon?

125
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:56,040
You forgot to report to me about
the man who took medicine...

126
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,340
...from his firm without permission.

127
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,870
I'm still looking into that case.

128
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,540
I intended to report on it
at the next meeting.

129
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,720
I don't want to hear excuses.

130
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,620
If this is something that
we've been waiting for...

131
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,790
...isn't there just one
thing that you must do?

132
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,590
Never mind. I'll be
waiting to hear from you.

133
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:31,170
And it seems like the woman
he's with is no ordinary one.

134
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,440
Master Shingo...

135
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,580
Oh, Master Shingo!

136
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,700
Sis...

137
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,350
This completes the list.

138
00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:00,030
All right, Jun. You go through
all the contacts in this case.

139
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,520
You got it!

140
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,200
And you and I will go
to the subject's house.

141
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,500
What? The police have
already checked that out.

142
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,000
One more time.

143
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,870
We really don't have much
to go on right now, after all.

144
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,140
We have to go back
to basics and check it ourselves.

145
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,140
I see.

146
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,810
In that case, we should get
the data on all similar incidents.

147
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,210
Good idea. I've leave
that one up to you.

148
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,160
Okay! Let's go as soon as we're ready!

149
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,170
Kenji! Yuko!

150
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,180
Kei.

151
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,220
Are you going home?

152
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,290
Yeah. Are you on your way to work?

153
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,690
Yeah, I'm in the middle of a case.

154
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,520
Um, Kenji.
I'm a little concerned about Yuko.

155
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,190
Make sure she doesn't leave the
apartment on her own.

156
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,130
Did something happen?

157
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,060
There's a serial rape case.

158
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,040
Oh, my!

159
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,180
I saw one of the crime
scenes around here recently.

160
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,700
I've never seen anything so terrible.

161
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,870
So please be careful, Yuko.

162
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,480
All right. We'll be careful, Kei.

163
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,710
Well, I'll see you later, Kenji!

164
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,690
And Yuko, too!

165
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,560
Yeah, see you!

166
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,670
Hey! What're you trying to pull?!

167
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,290
This all seems pretty creepy.

168
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,010
I don't know what this is all about,
but coming after me...

169
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,430
...is something you'll regret!

170
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,830
Outta my way!

171
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,190
Step back.

172
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,330
You're no match for this one.

173
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,140
After all, she managed to dodge
that beast on her own.

174
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,110
A tough and wild physique.

175
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,080
Just my type.

176
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,920
What're you talking about, bitch?!

177
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,490
Wh-What're you doing?

178
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,660
S-Stop it. Don't do this.

179
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,070
You feel awfully good.
I'm liking you even more.

180
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,460
A boxer out running?

181
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,300
He doesn't have anything on him.

182
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,500
Half his body's burned.

183
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,800
This corpse is in such horrible shape.

184
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,200
Huh? This medicine...

185
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,700
There's something suspicious about it.

186
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,110
Kaizear Pharmaceuticals!

187
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,340
That's my brother's company!

188
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,220
Kenji!

189
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,530
Kenji...
