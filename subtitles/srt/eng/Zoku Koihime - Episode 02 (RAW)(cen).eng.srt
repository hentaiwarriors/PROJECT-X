1
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,929
Finally, I have returned.

2
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,266
I've waited so long for you, Musashi-chan.

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,018
For me?

4
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:23,981
Ah.. This is a man's.. ah.. Musashi-chan.

5
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:28,902
You're wrong. This isn't a mirror
that reflects your thoughts.

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:37,536
Exactly, I'm the banishing chief of Homurabe.
and this is my beautiful only daughter.

7
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,913
Chief meeting?

8
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,125
We must decide how to deal with the Enra.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,044
Take me with you.

10
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,295
What?

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,840
I will speak with them directly.

12
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,554
Love Princess 2

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,099
Let me meet the chiefs.

14
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,228
You just don't understand, do you? You
shouldn't be involved with us anymore.

15
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,188
What?

16
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,106
I'm telling you to forget everything.

17
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,443
Forget? You old geezer!

18
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,781
Musashi-chan!
Onii-chan!

19
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,536
Stop resisting. It will only be more painful.

20
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:23,040
No... I... I'll...

21
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:24,958
I'll...

22
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,092
won't forget!

23
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,428
Erase it from your mind.
Resistance is futile!

24
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,225
Musashi...

25
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,477
Onii-chan, you're going to die.

26
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,980
Musashi-san.

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,107
Musashi...

28
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,858
That's enough.

29
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:51,655
Musashi, stop!

30
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,028
Onii-chan! Stop!

31
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,321
Musashi-sama!

32
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,407
Musashi, give it up!

33
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,284
Shut up you old fart.

34
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,829
I'll never forget!!

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,680
Where...?

36
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,306
Musashi-san.

37
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:26,270
Musashi-san, have you regained conciousness? Thank god.

38
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,440
Nami-san. Where is this?

39
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,692
The prison in my father's castle.

40
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,444
The dragon-king's castle?

41
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,947
Tengu-sama used too much
magic and is sleeping.

42
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:42,369
So other chiefs decided to keep you here.

43
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,665
But why are you here, Nami-san?

44
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,669
They could not forgive me for
removing the solving seal.

45
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,921
I'm paying for my own mistake.

46
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,299
Then other girls too?

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,344
Yes. They are under house arrest.

48
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,470
No way.

49
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,181
Don't worry about us.

50
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,224
We are all impressed.

51
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:09,188
Because you won against Tengu's powerful magic.

52
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,399
I'll never forget!!

53
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,110
Your feelings for saving that person...

54
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,740
We are ready to accept any punishment.

55
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,577
Even if we really are to be separated...

56
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,747
I will continue to live and
support that person's heart.

57
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,291
Thank you, Musashi-san.

58
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,462
Nami-san, it's too early to give up

59
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,132
I will talk to the dragon king
so don't cry so much.

60
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,428
Don't touch there!

61
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,554
Why not?

62
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,306
Oh no...

63
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,850
What's wrong Nami-san?

64
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:53,899
For girls... our horns .. are the
most sensitive parts of our body.

65
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,317
Like a G-spot?

66
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,736
No, not like that...

67
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,199
Ah, that feels good.

68
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,410
Looks good.

69
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,995
Musashi-san... that...

70
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,251
Not here... It's indiscrete.

71
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:17,214
Isn't that what makes this place
a good place? Right Nami-san?

72
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,591
No, we can't.

73
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,347
More... I mean... Stop it. Musashi-san...

74
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,643
We cant.

75
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,562
How about here?

76
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,273
Harder... no, please stop.

77
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,654
Please let me go. If we keep going...

78
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,866
I'm all ready half dead...

79
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,410
Come with me Sasaki Musashi.

80
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,954
You're going to meet the Dragon Master.

81
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,540
So you like it like this?

82
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,251
W-what the hell are you doing?!

83
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,928
I have never seen a human like you.

84
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,599
Coming to se me like this.

85
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,935
I'm really angry at you.

86
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,359
First off, everything that's happened
is because of the demons in your clan.

87
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,862
I'm just some outsider that got involved.

88
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,325
You just go around erasing peoples
memories and tearing things up.

89
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,329
Furthermore, aren't you a parent?
Release Nami-san now.

90
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,295
You're tiny but you've got
balls to talk to me like that.

91
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,214
In consideration for your courage...

92
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,799
You're going to release her?

93
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,510
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying I'll giving you a chance.

94
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,636
A chance?

95
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:54,269
If you beat me or one of other chiefs,
I'll listen to you.

96
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,647
Let's do it!

97
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,858
I won't let you easy just because
you're Nami's father.

98
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,736
Well said. Now bring it on!

99
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,114
Now?

100
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,243
W-Wait a second... I'm not ready yet.

101
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,377
Go easy on me a bit.

102
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,969
That damn chief. I'll make him beg for mercy.

103
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,221
Papa, are we really going to do this?

104
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:34,018
Of course. Why do you think we went
through all that trouble to get here?

105
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,895
I don't really care for revenge though.

106
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,440
There's no point if we get caught again.

107
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:44,528
We won't. We have to clear
our names of that humiliation.

108
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,532
That brat has the right of
succession in for four tribes.

109
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:55,581
If he married you then we'd
have power over them.

110
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,417
I wonder if this will really work out.

111
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,588
Well I don't care about the rest if I get Musashi.

112
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:03,881
Tamamo.

113
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,051
Sorry for using you like this.

114
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:12,014
Someday I'll introduce you to a man
who'll be a better match for you.

115
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,976
I know already. No need to repeat yourself.

116
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,228
You're a good girl.

117
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,943
So this is Kakibe tribes' castle.
Anzu-chan's home.

118
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,239
There's no way I can beat that Dragon King.

119
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,284
Maybe Anzu-chan's mother might help.

120
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,625
Welcome. I'm the Kakibe chief, Namiki.

121
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:45,506
I've already heard from the Dragon King.
Feel free to come forward at any time.

122
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:52,888
I'm not in a hurry.
Why don't we talk for a bit?

123
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,099
Would you like me to massage your back?

124
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,017
No, thank you.

125
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,569
What's this? Finished already? How boring.

126
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,032
Ouch.

127
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,243
Musashi!

128
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,202
Onii-chan!

129
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,328
Are you awake?

130
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,206
Anzu-chan? And Suzaku-san?

131
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,458
Are you hurt? I feel so sorry for you.

132
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,795
Seez, mother should have held back a bit.

133
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,213
Where is this?

134
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,298
Prison under the Namiki's castle.

135
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:34,221
Prison!? Then... Ah, we're locked in.

136
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,099
But why are you here?

137
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:41,562
My grandfather has been asleep for
a while so I've been confined here.

138
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,147
I've heard from my mother..

139
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,273
Onii-chan...

140
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,817
You must beat all tribes chief right?

141
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,069
Did you say all?

142
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:53,699
You're weak and always run away
but you're a man after all.

143
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,950
I've changed my opinion of you.

144
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,617
Umm...

145
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,703
Go for it, Onii-chan. But don't die.

146
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,206
When did it come to this?

147
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,751
Suzaku-san.

148
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,047
This is our clans way of expressing love.
Good luck.

149
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,299
I guess I'll do it too.

150
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:15,888
What are these two doing getting
it on like that. If that's the case...

151
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,058
Suzaku-san... It tickles.

152
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,562
Hey Anzu! VVhat are you doing?

153
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,732
Anzu-chan, I'm impressed
by your expression of love.

154
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,484
There's no way...

155
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,028
Musashi?

156
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,454
Hey Anzu, stop it!

157
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,124
But onii-chan looks like
he's enjoying himself.

158
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,710
Is it really okay?

159
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,006
Anzu, let me do it too.

160
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,884
Let me borrow it.

161
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:01,058
Hey, you have to be more gentle.
I feel sorry for him.

162
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,602
My turn.

163
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:07,606
If you do it like that...

164
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,732
Here's my chance.
If you do it like that...

165
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,443
That's not fair, Anzu.

166
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,321
Well I do love him more.

167
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,158
I love him more than you.

168
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,410
Idot.

169
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,202
No, I do!

170
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,287
I love both of you.

171
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,039
You!!
You!!

172
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,294
More, that feels great, Onii-chan!

173
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,965
Lick me more!

174
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:53,110
Right there! More! Harder!

175
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,406
You're so beautiful.

176
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,802
Wow, it looks so intense!

177
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,888
I'm getting excited.

178
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,180
Anzu.
I'm getting excited.

179
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,809
It's embarrassing but it feels good.

180
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,650
Onii-chan, hurry! Hurry!

181
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,739
Onii-chan's in me...

182
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,576
That feels great!
Fucking great!

183
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,543
Anzu, I can feel it.

184
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,298
I'm going to come.

185
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,721
I'm coming.

186
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,099
Me too. I'm coming too.

187
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,187
Coming...

188
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,662
I came so many times.

189
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:31,750
Me too. But I love him more than you.

190
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,043
I love him more!

191
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,754
Onii-chan, do it with me again.

192
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,007
No, do it with me.

193
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,091
With me?

194
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,676
Pretend I'm sleeping... pretend...

195
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,391
He's going to risk his life and fight...

196
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,643
Please be safe.

197
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,029
Mayuki is too strong a girl that gets the wrong
impressions. I don't know what to do with her.

198
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,658
She might burden you but
please try and tolerate her.

199
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:09,580
You are the only one I can count on.

200
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:14,043
Oh, I hope I won't be a burder to her either.

201
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:19,340
Thank god Shizuhi-san's a nice person
and she's listening to what I'm saying.

202
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,884
Well, shall we do this now?

203
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,010
What?

204
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,931
I think I have the lowest
powers of all four chiefs but...

205
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,310
Please don't hold back.
Give me your best shot.

206
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,021
My best?!

207
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,984
Oh, what should I do?

208
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,569
I didn't do anything yet.

209
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,614
Um, are you still alive?

210
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,325
Uh, yeah... somehow.

211
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,828
I should have expected this
from Mayuki-san's mother.

212
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,591
Calling me at this hour.
I wonder if something is happened.

213
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,972
This must be the place.

214
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,979
Musashi-sama? Are you in there?

215
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,898
Musashi-sama?

216
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,358
Mayuki-chan?

217
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,317
Yes.

218
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,403
You did good escaping from the castle.

219
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:27,658
Because my mother's how she is,
it's easy to distract her and escape.

220
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:31,161
But why are you here Musashi-sama?

221
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,706
I have been beaten by the chiefs.

222
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:34,999
What?

223
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,043
I wanted to at least hear
your voice before I died.

224
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,421
No way! Musashi-sama!

225
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:44,591
Hold on! Open this door! If I don't
treat your wounds immediately...

226
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,176
No, I can't do that.

227
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:50,014
No, don't say that.

228
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,057
I'll open this door.

229
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,728
Musashi-sama?

230
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,273
Musashi-sama, where are you?

231
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,483
No, you mustn't get close to me.

232
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,236
Why, Musashi-sama?

233
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:09,158
Because if we touch each other, we'll disappear.

234
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,498
Anzu.

235
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,624
Suzume-chan.

236
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,295
Wake up.

237
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:23,839
Nami-onee-chan?

238
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,550
Don't speak too loudly.

239
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,969
What's going on at this time of day?

240
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,972
I got a message from Musashi-san
so I escaped from the castle.

241
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,265
From Musashi?

242
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,017
Did something happen to Onii-chan?

243
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,728
I don't know the details but...

244
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,939
Anyways, he says he needs to meet us.

245
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,902
Where is Musashi?

246
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:49,239
Come with me and quietly so
that Namiki doesn't notice.

247
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,791
That old man is supposed to be sleeping.

248
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,006
What are you doing?

249
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,884
Old man!!! When did you?

250
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,469
Are you the real Musashi?

251
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,598
Of course I am. Are there
any handsome guys here?

252
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,936
Why are you loitering around here?

253
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:23,857
I snuck in to beat you up while you slept!

254
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:28,821
Even if you are sick, a win is a win!
You better not complain.

255
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,699
Hmm... it seems you are the real Musashi.

256
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,828
Why are you floating there when
you're supposed to be sleeping?

257
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,872
Like I have time to be sleeping
during this serious matter.

258
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,624
Serious matter?

259
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:49,883
So Enra has kidnapped Suzaku and everyone else and
won't release them unless I exchange myself?

260
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,176
Right.

261
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:51,802
Geez...

262
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,221
Are you going?

263
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:58,809
Well, if I don't they'll be killed right?
So I have to go.

264
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,562
If it involves the Enra, this has to be a trap.

265
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,772
Do you intend to slip through their trap?

266
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,025
A trap, eh?

267
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:10,988
Well, either way, it's better than being killed
by the Dragon King and the other chiefs.

268
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,699
Musashi.

269
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,535
Sorry, that's the way it is.

270
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,787
What are you saying all of a sudden?

271
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,331
Please rescue all four of them.

272
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:27,087
If you can beat the Enra,
I'll grant you anything you want.

273
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,380
Really?

274
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,591
Yeah, I won't trick you.

275
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,721
Remember that promise old man!

276
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,139
Yahoo!

277
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,809
That dumbass. He thinks he's already won.

278
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:49,109
That damn stupid fox... Imprisoning my precious
girls place in such place. Prepare yourself!

279
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,080
Where am?

280
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,998
Musashi-san!

281
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,542
It's been so long!

282
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,002
T-Tamomo-chan.

283
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,880
You came to see me, right? I'm so happy.

284
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,591
Er.. no, I come to talk to Enra.

285
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,636
Forget about daddy.

286
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,680
I can't do that.

287
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,932
By the way where is this?

288
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,901
This is the former site of Momurabe royal palace.

289
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,865
This is what became of it
after we were exiled.

290
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,998
Hey, just forget about that.

291
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,280
We haven't seen each other in such
a long time. Let's fuck. Okay?

292
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,750
I want to have a lot of babies
and re-build Homurabe.

293
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:42,454
Come on, it's alright right? Come on, Musashi-chan?

294
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,507
That'd be nice.
Come on, it's alright right? Come on, Musashi-chan?

295
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:45,958
I mean, no, no!

296
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,876
No, I didn't come here for this.

297
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,965
You know where Mayuki-chan, Anzu-chan,
Nami-san and Suzaku-san are, don't you?

298
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:53,924
Musashi-chan...

299
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,176
Tell me where they are.

300
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,139
Who is more important to you? Them or me?

301
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,183
Didn't you say you were going to marry me?

302
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,436
Did I?

303
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:06,854
You did!

304
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,313
Hmm... did I?

305
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,898
That's mean! You tricked me!

306
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,609
Do I look like someone
who should get married?

307
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,528
Answer me!

308
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,072
Who would you choose?

309
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:21,076
What would you do if I
said I liked them better?

310
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:25,706
Well, maybe daddy will get angry and kill them.

311
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,961
That's too bad, I never wanted
to see this side of you.

312
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:34,798
We might have been able to be friends...

313
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,383
Musashi-chan.

314
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:37,676
Don't touch me!

315
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,554
Any enemy of those girls
are my enemies as well.

316
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,935
Could you take me to where they are?

317
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:49,813
Musashi-san.

318
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,065
Onii-chan!

319
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,150
Musashi-sama.

320
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,069
Are all of youill right?

321
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:58,572
We're all right but we feel
sorry for Miyuki-chan.

322
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,409
Enra!! You bastard!

323
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,120
This idiot has finally showed up.

324
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:09,124
I come as promised.
Now let those four go!

325
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,795
First you must make a blood oath with Tamamo.

326
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:18,550
Swear to be Tamamo's in front of us.

327
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,221
If I do that will you release them?

328
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:23,972
Yes.

329
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:25,724
Don't do it! Onii-chan!

330
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,643
Don't swear to her!

331
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,688
Stop!

332
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,272
Don't do it, Musashi! Stop!

333
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,857
No, Musashi!

334
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:50,457
No, no... I won't do this.
It feels so stupid.

335
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,042
I'm out of this agreement.

336
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,669
What are you saying?

337
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,965
I'd rather be dead than be
with this worthless scum.

338
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,217
It feels gross just being touched by him.

339
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,594
That's so mean.

340
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,513
You selfish girl!

341
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:08,017
My revenge plan is all
messed up because of you!

342
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,269
Well then, all that's left...

343
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,480
Is to kill all of you!!!

344
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,984
Brat, you're the first to die!

345
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,120
Tamamo!

346
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:38,595
Tamamo-chan...

347
00:21:39,471 --> 00:21:40,499
Don't worry...

348
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:45,054
I may not look like it but
I'm a Homurabe princess.

349
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:46,680
Hang on!

350
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:50,976
Impossible! Why did my
daughter protect a human?1

351
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,065
Damnit! Why are all you
demons such crappy parents?

352
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,816
What did you say?

353
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,653
You're a big dumbass who can't even understand
the true feelings of his daughter!!

354
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,865
Her... true feelings?

355
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,165
It can't be.. it can't mean..

356
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:17,294
You chose this brat over
your father? Tamamo?!

357
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:18,420
Daddy...

358
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,673
What is it? I'm right here.

359
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:27,513
Daddy, please don't kill Musashi-chan's
precious princesses.

360
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,431
Tamamo...

361
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,894
Please, forget about your
revenge. Okay? Daddy...

362
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,313
Tamamo! Tamamo!

363
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,399
Tamamo..!!

364
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,113
I've lost.

365
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,080
I won!

366
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:06,301
What's with that stupid expression.
Look more like a groom.

367
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,761
But.. it's just..

368
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,550
I can't believe they consented to this.

369
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,695
It was the decision of the chiefs
but is this really all right?

370
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,106
Well I did beat Enra.

371
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,609
By the way, what's happened
to Enra and Tamamo-chan?

372
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:25,334
We couldn't give them capital punishment.

373
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:29,041
So we seal their magic and sentenced
them to eternal banishment.

374
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,743
Eternal banishment?

375
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:35,831
They're probably living somewhere
as a human family.

376
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:40,169
Wow... that's so nice. You've got
some good points after all.

377
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,754
Hey, don't get any ideas.

378
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,798
The bride preparations
have been completed.

379
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,343
So, it's finally time.

380
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:51,180
Hey, so who did you decide
would be my wife?

381
00:23:51,873 --> 00:23:52,792
Well...

382
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,143
Here they come.

383
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,069
What?!

384
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:09,365
I may be inexperienced but
please let me be your wife.

385
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,869
Is this ethically allowed?

386
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:20,084
This is what we decided. We thought
we'd leave you to be the chief.

387
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:25,339
If someday Enra or someone like him comes
we expect you to take care of them.

388
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:29,510
Please take care of your wives, son-in-law.

389
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,305
Please have an balanced
number of boys and girls.

390
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:36,975
Balanced number?

391
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:40,354
Don't tell me I'm just supposed to breed.

392
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,483
Onii-chan.

393
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,987
I really became you're wife didn't I?

394
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,824
Yeah, I hope we're happy together.

395
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:52,950
I love you!!

396
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:59,665
I can't wait, hurry and strip.

397
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,417
Okay, okay.

398
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,421
That's the spot.

399
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,050
Wow, it's so big.

400
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,761
Anju-chan as well.
You're so wet.

401
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:17,224
No, not there. I said no.

402
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,143
It sounds squishy.

403
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,145
I can't have all the fun.

404
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,772
W-Wait a second.

405
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,276
This girl always takes the lead so...

406
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,113
This is too embarassing.

407
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,698
I can see your cutest body part.

408
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,576
It feels so good.

409
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:38,620
No...

410
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:41,331
No, I'm coming.

411
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,543
Stop it.

412
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,754
Please stop it.

413
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,798
Please, hurry and put it in.

414
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,717
No, not yet.

415
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,094
You're so mean.

416
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,598
Onii-chan...

417
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,857
I'm coming...

418
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:18,535
I'm coming. I'm coming!

419
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,084
Greetings again...

420
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:28,754
Have you been waiting for me naked?

421
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:33,550
In ancient times, wives of samurais were
well mannered and waited like this.

422
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,221
It was to prove that they
weren't hiding any weapons.

423
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,598
Lets finish this up quick.

424
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,102
Hurry up Musashi and strip.

425
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,853
I'm tired of waiting.

426
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,691
Don't be in such a hurry.
I'm not going to run away.

427
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:03,872
Please, no foreplay. Fuck me now.

428
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,875
This is in exchange for
always tormenting me.

429
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:11,672
That's... stop it...

430
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,550
No more, I'm getting horny.

431
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,802
That's...

432
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,139
Please stop.

433
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:24,309
I'm going to die.

434
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,479
This should be enough...

435
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,284
There... there...

436
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:44,413
Unbelievable!

437
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,920
No, what are you doing?

438
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,550
I can't hold it anymore.

439
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:08,354
F-F-F-Freczing room.

440
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:09,813
Are we going to do it here?

441
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,816
Yes. If not I'll melt.

442
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:17,279
But if it's this cold, he cant feel anything

443
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:22,868
This is secret medicine  from
my mother. Here you go.

444
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,454
Is it safe for me to drink this?

445
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,206
Don't worry.

446
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,673
My body is burning!

447
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:37,091
Yay!

448
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,676
Mayuki-chan!!

449
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,013
Unbelievable.

450
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:48,102
Not like that. I'll burst.

451
00:28:58,488 --> 00:28:59,780
Finished already?

452
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:04,243
I got all excited quickly but
it only lasted for a moment.

453
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:07,413
That's all right but we
did just get married...

454
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,457
Sorry but my body's just...

455
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,627
We still have a lot of medicine.

456
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:17,339
Wonderful!

457
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,175
This is so good.

458
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,177
I can't take it anymore.

459
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:33,772
This feels great! This
position is the best.

460
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:40,446
I'm coming!

461
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,201
You seem very tired.

462
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,454
Don't worry, I'm fine.

463
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,664
Please relax.

464
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,709
I'll do all the work.

465
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:58,172
Nami-san, you're so beautiful.

466
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,090
Don't say that...

467
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:01,550
Now lay on the bed...

468
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:02,801
Sure, sure.

469
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:06,305
I'm going to start now.

470
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:14,938
That's great, Nami-san.

471
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:16,690
Now how about this.

472
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:25,324
Nami-san, I'm so happy you're
letting me fuck your breasts.

473
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:29,161
I'm your wife. This is the least I can do.

474
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:32,039
You're such a nice person.

475
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:34,249
So in exchange, I'll...

476
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,590
Um, Nami-san? You don't have to...

477
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,387
Sorry, I was just lost in ecstasy.

478
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:49,098
It's not your fault.

479
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,183
But your sperm.

480
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:55,187
Don' t worry. Let' s do it again. Okay?

481
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,065
Musashi-san... Okay.

482
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,072
That's great.

483
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,157
I can feel you in me.

484
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:12,246
So good.

485
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:15,124
Musashi-san.

486
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:30,305
The sun's so bright.

487
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:34,601
I didn't know the guy's dream of a
harem would be this dead-tiring.

488
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:37,021
I brought a lot of snacks.

489
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,772
I told you this is not a picnic.

490
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,483
But I wonder what the city is like.

491
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:43,527
I'm looking forward to it.

492
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:48,657
Musashi-san, we'll be right beside
you until you graduate high school.

493
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,535
I'm so happy I'm crying...

494
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:55,372
Don't forget to make babies
while you're studying.

495
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:58,417
Make 5, no 6 babies!

496
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,253
If it's Musashi, I'm sure
he'll make at least 10.

497
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,880
I'm looking forward to it.

498
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:04,006
Leave it to us!

499
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:04,965
Oh father
We'll do our best!

500
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:06,842
My Iife's too hard!

501
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,469
Hey' wait!!

502
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:11,180
Give me a break!

503
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:13,557
We'll see you when we get back!
