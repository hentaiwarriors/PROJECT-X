1
00:00:02,019 --> 00:00:04,920
The readings are showing that
Bio-Body has been repaired to 100%...

2
00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:09,015
...and the brain wave have
recovered up to 70%.

3
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:12,019
Begin degeneration process.

4
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,802
Sayuka.

5
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,807
What are we going to do now?

6
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,441
Madoka.

7
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:32,742
What is it?

8
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:35,579
Is there any chance to win at all?

9
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:40,455
There is one...

10
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:41,819
Really?

11
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:45,319
Hey, Madoka?

12
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:49,590
Just forget it. It is
beyond her capabilities.

13
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:53,498
Let's take her back to her normal life.

14
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:09,075
Dr. Arc!

15
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:14,185
FM77! What do you think you are
doing?

16
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,889
I've been waiting for you.

17
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:18,584
What?

18
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:22,026
Misllene, she got the Doki-Doki
Dynamo. Ah...

19
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,765
Stop your mumbling, old man!

20
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,468
Stop it!

21
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,307
I thought you'd be happy.

22
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:35,343
With the Doki-Doki Dynamo,
I will be absolutely perfect.

23
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,778
What's wrong with me
using that for my gain?

24
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:42,541
C'mon now, commander, Misllene!

25
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:45,121
Why don't you start making me feel
hot?

26
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:46,381
You!

27
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,084
You want to fight?

28
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:54,257
That's fine, but you'll never beat me!

29
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,891
Let's find out!

30
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:01,799
Beat Angel Escalayer

31
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:11,781
A tiny little thing can
make me happy everyday.

32
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:18,784
I am scared that I might
not have it tomorrow.

33
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:25,793
First love is forever.

34
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:32,764
Is it okay to dream that
my wish will come true?

35
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,937
When your finger touches my heart...

36
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:46,807
...my heart beats faster.
Escalation!

37
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:52,317
I can feel hot energy in my body.

38
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:59,359
To protect the green planet,
my heart beats stronger.

39
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:06,469
I awaken the power to defeat evil.

40
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,237
I can be stronger,
to protect someone I love.

41
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:24,044
I will hold the sword
of courage, I love you.

42
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:38,624
Episode Three: Counter-Attack

43
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:53,080
I guess it is the time for this...

44
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:58,080
There is a Beta version
of Doki-Doki Dynamo.

45
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:01,583
Beta version? So, it's a trial product?

46
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:05,486
Even though it is the Beta version,
there is not a big difference...

47
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:08,063
...when compared to the master
version of the Doki-Doki Dynamo.

48
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:11,598
Actually, the Beta version
exceeds the master one.

49
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:12,596
Then...

50
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:16,638
However, the Beta version
does has a crucial problem.

51
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,134
Once.

52
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:23,437
You can only charge
the Beta version once.

53
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:29,577
The advantage is that we can pull out
higher energy from the Beta version.

54
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,253
However, due to the higher energy...

55
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:37,121
...it is possible for the body to
melt if we do charge it twice due to the...

56
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,626
...current limitations
in Bio-Body technology.

57
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,325
And one more thing...

58
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:42,996
There's more?

59
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,369
The Beta version is a
very unstable product.

60
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,130
If the charging fails,
the Beta can go very wrong.

61
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:51,433
Conversely, it can diminish by itself...

62
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,999
...and take Sayuka as
well as the Bio-body.

63
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:56,703
Diminish?

64
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:01,182
We won't be able to use
it if it's that dangerous.

65
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:02,849
It's going to be fine.

66
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:04,311
Sayuka?

67
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:05,753
Sayuka!

68
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,350
Are you okay? You shouldn't be up.

69
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,657
Thank you for worrying about me.

70
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,263
But, I think I am okay now.

71
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,965
Madoka, if you have a minute, can
you put the Beta version on me?

72
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:24,266
Sayuka, were you listening to us?

73
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,769
But I...

74
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:34,911
It's gonna be all right, because
we are experts in Doki-Doki Dynamo.

75
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:36,784
Right? Kyo?

76
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,512
What's this? This doesn't
feel as good as I expected.

77
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:14,451
Your pussy's gotten a little loose.

78
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,589
Since your pussy is useless...

79
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:24,667
...why don't you use your mouth
and make me feel good, huh?

80
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,693
There...

81
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,102
Hurry up!

82
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:41,543
Oh yeah, I'm getting hot.

83
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,049
That's right. Suck it harder!

84
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:51,049
That's it! Keep doing that and make
my pussy feel good with your hand too.

85
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,531
That's good.

86
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:08,574
You're doing good.

87
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,719
I'm coming! I'm coming!

88
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:28,259
More! Harder!

89
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,657
Harder!

90
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:04,356
That is the Beta version.

91
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,770
Sayuka, are you sure you wanna do
this?

92
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,999
Well... how do you
want to charge it next?

93
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,737
How do you like to do it, Kyo?

94
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:19,508
Do you really know how serious this is?

95
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:20,679
Kyohei?

96
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:23,582
Sayuka, aren't you scared?

97
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:25,687
If this fails...

98
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:29,321
It's not like you,
getting worried like that.

99
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,987
I know I have nothing to
worry about with you, Kyo.

100
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:37,030
But I...

101
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,595
Kyo?

102
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:40,699
I'm...

103
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:42,399
I don't want to do this!

104
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:45,030
I'm scared! I can't do this!

105
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,352
Sayuka?

106
00:08:58,555 --> 00:08:59,647
Of course...

107
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,589
I'm terrified too, Kyo...

108
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:08,296
...and I've never been afraid to fight.

109
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,096
I am going to dispose of this.

110
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:15,501
Sayuka?

111
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,335
You'll help me, right? Madoka?

112
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,409
I-I'm sorry, are you all right...?

113
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:27,683
Miss Ryoko!

114
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:40,118
Warm-up your feelings by
watching me masturbate, Sayuka.

115
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:48,737
Are you watching me?

116
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:03,881
Miss Ryoko.

117
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,653
Um, did something happen to you?

118
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,166
I'm tired that's all...

119
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,340
I've realized how useless I was...

120
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:30,946
I've been trying my best for him.

121
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:34,675
I've been trying so hard
to fulfill his dream...

122
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:38,713
I thought there's a person
who will finally make me happy.

123
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:44,289
I felt like I could do anything! I felt like I
could overcome anything, but...

124
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,997
But I don't think I can do it anymore.

125
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:53,795
I'm not sure if I can
even smile for him anymore.

126
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:57,100
Kyo, you can do it.
Let's try hard, okay?

127
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,642
I know I can do it with you, Kyo!

128
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:04,040
Kyo!

129
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:06,942
Sayuka.

130
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:12,087
That's not true!

131
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:15,184
You aren't useless, Ryoko!

132
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:19,419
I can't explain it, I
know that's not true!

133
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:23,120
The Ryoko that I know
is beautiful and kind...

134
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,292
has a wonderful smile, and is sexy...

135
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:30,736
And also you smell really nice, and...

136
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,537
...I don't quite know
how to say this, but...

137
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:46,214
That was for encouraging me.

138
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:48,824
Thank you, Kyohei.

139
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,151
Sorry to have worried
you, but I'm fine now.

140
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,924
I'm glad to hear that!

141
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,794
Well, I have to get going.

142
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,926
I have to go see her...

143
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:02,264
See you later.

144
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:15,716
Sayuka, are you watching me?

145
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,212
I feel so hot.

146
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:25,358
I shouldn't be losing
myself like this, but...

147
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,528
Madoka.

148
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:29,461
Sayuka!

149
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:30,554
Sayuka!

150
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,460
Kyo?

151
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:33,791
Sayuka...

152
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:39,331
I'm sorry that I couldn't
understand your feelings...

153
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,279
...but I finally know.

154
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:46,712
And I am not running
away, I'll stay with you.

155
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:52,580
I wanted to ask you if you'd
let me fight together again!

156
00:12:57,226 --> 00:12:58,352
Kyo!

157
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,162
Kyo!

158
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:02,294
Kyo, Kyo...

159
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,593
There is no way I'll
let you fight alone.

160
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:11,205
I might not be much help yet,
but I'm going to try really hard.

161
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,705
Let's fight together.

162
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:17,502
I'm really sorry.

163
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,572
No, don't be sorry.

164
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,059
Don't push yourself too hard, Madoka.

165
00:13:32,362 --> 00:13:35,695
Don't worry. I should be
able to buy you some time.

166
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:40,064
Hopefully you can charge the
Dynamo while I distract it.

167
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,838
Don't worry, we're going to charge it!

168
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,705
I am counting on the two of you.

169
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:51,075
I should get going. I must
protect civilians from the attack.

170
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:59,019
Kyo, the Dynamo is stabilized.

171
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:04,249
Sayuka, I have something
I want to tell you.

172
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:11,223
Actually, I wrote you a letter
the day before you moved out.

173
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,662
"I wanted to be with you forever...

174
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,573
...and I didn't want us to be apart."

175
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:22,706
But I didn't have the
courage to give it to you.

176
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:27,748
Kyo, that's so sweet.

177
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:38,921
I regretted it all night.

178
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:42,258
I kept asking myself why
I didn't give it to you.

179
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:47,426
But this time, you gave me the courage.

180
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:52,871
I want to be with you, forever and ever.

181
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:55,903
Kyo...

182
00:14:58,347 --> 00:14:59,336
Kyo!

183
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:01,546
I want to be with you too, Kyo.

184
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,479
I'm so happy!

185
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,213
Kiss me.

186
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:09,083
Yes.

187
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,165
Kyo...

188
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:27,971
Sayuka!

189
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:30,034
K-Kyo!

190
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,283
Something is burning
inside me! It's hot!

191
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:39,754
My heart is beating so fast...

192
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:40,923
I'm scared!

193
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:43,316
I'm scared, Kyo!

194
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:45,052
Kyo!

195
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,762
It's hot!

196
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:52,162
It's so hot!

197
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:58,532
Don't worry, I'm here.

198
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,672
I won't go anywhere, I'll
stay with you, forever...

199
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:10,383
There's still something
important that I want to tell you...

200
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,777
...so, hang in there!

201
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:16,181
Kyo!

202
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:23,622
Sayuka!

203
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,699
Kyo!

204
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:46,351
Well, well...

205
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:48,986
Is that all you got? This is so boring

206
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:53,454
I'm not too surprised, since
Escalayer was also trash.

207
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:55,724
Escalayer is not trash!

208
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:57,128
Is that right?

209
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,696
I know who you are...

210
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:02,269
You're Escalayer's
assistant robot, aren't you?

211
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:11,740
That's why I won't kill you just
yet, I'm going to enjoy it slowly.

212
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,686
Your pussy also looks like
a real one, doesn't it?

213
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:22,950
Well, what about this one?

214
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:28,160
So you can feel this one too?

215
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:29,697
How do you like it?

216
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:38,737
You seem to enjoy it.

217
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:41,401
I'll make you feel even better...

218
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:46,946
Enjoy it slowly.

219
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:50,112
Now, I'll move it...

220
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:51,553
Stop!

221
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:55,387
How do you like it? Huh?

222
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:03,663
You're going to tear my butt up!

223
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,109
You're nothing but a robot...

224
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:25,778
But the party has just started

225
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:29,682
What was that?

226
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:42,195
Escalayer? But how?

227
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:45,068
I took the Doki-Doki Dynamo out...

228
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:49,702
I don't care. Now I can have more fun...

229
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,208
You made it, I'm so glad!

230
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,442
Yes, so please don't worry.

231
00:18:55,885 --> 00:19:02,017
Please be careful, I think she's
equipped with the Doki-Doki Dynamo.

232
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:02,715
Okay.

233
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:09,726
I'm so sorry, but I'm going to
have to get into recovery mode...

234
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,170
I'm counting on you, Sayuka.

235
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:27,446
The empire of evil, Dielast! I
won't let you do whatever you want!

236
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:33,650
To protect the green earth,
my heartbeats reach the sky.

237
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:36,222
Escalayer!

238
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:41,528
I am here to put an
end to your evil ways!

239
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:45,228
Let's fight, then!

240
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:46,762
I won't lose.

241
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:56,571
How do you feel about getting blown
away by your own Doki-Doki Dynamo?

242
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,711
It doesn't work for me.

243
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:01,407
Well, it's my turn now!

244
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,333
You bitch!

245
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:32,272
What is this power?

246
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:33,138
Why?

247
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:57,736
Why? I should be more powerful
with the Doki-Doki Dynamo...

248
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:06,403
This heartbeat is not
just a mere energy source.

249
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:09,176
You don't understand what the
real meaning of a heartbeat is!

250
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:12,311
What the hell are you talking about?

251
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:20,053
I'll finish you!

252
00:21:20,563 --> 00:21:21,689
We'll see about that.

253
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:30,833
Escalayer, I'm going to blast this
cannon, and turn you into dust.

254
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,172
You're history!

255
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:37,837
Beat End!

256
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:44,886
Escalation!

257
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:07,835
Sayuka!

258
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:19,185
Kyo, I did it.

259
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:20,219
I did it!

260
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:22,790
You did, Sayuka!

261
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:25,953
Kyo!

262
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:44,278
Please do it, Kyo...

263
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,845
What do you want me to do, Escalayer?

264
00:22:46,982 --> 00:22:49,473
Here! I want you to touch here.

265
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:51,917
You have to tell me exactly where
you want me to touch, Escalayer!

266
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:56,052
Please, don't be mean, Kyo...

267
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:00,792
I want you to touch me here...

268
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,692
You're like a baby, Sayuka.

269
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:08,499
Kyo! It feels good!

270
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:19,037
Give it to me harder!

271
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:21,105
Give it to me deeper!

272
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,046
Your nipples are already hard.

273
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,350
Don't say that!

274
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:32,321
Not there.

275
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,328
You don't like it? Then, I'll stop it.

276
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:39,760
Don't stop, I want
you to do it harder...

277
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:48,008
Harder! Harder!

278
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,373
Good, Sayuka.

279
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,552
I'm going to come!

280
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:06,589
Not too impressive.

281
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,728
As far as I can see, I don't see a
bright future ahead of the two of you...

282
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:19,373
...in terms of a
long-term relationship.

283
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:20,497
You're joking, right?

284
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:21,940
I'm absolutely serious.

285
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:24,974
There will be more fights
against Dielast in the future.

286
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,244
The Doki-Doki Dynamo will be
a waste if you don't do better.

287
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:34,345
I think it would be better if
I join and help you two for now.

288
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:42,086
I think I'm already excited...

289
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:48,232
Now Kyohei, Sayuka is ready for you
now.

290
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,962
Come, Kyo.

291
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:51,970
Oh, yeah!

292
00:24:59,148 --> 00:25:01,241
Kyohei, not me!

293
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,580
You're supposed to do Sayuka!

294
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,680
Does it matter? We're all here naked.

295
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:08,017
But...

296
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,560
...it feels good...

297
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,300
That's not fair!

298
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,445
Now my turn!

299
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:52,959
Come, Kyo!

300
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:56,503
I'm coming!

301
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,678
Dielast is on its way!

302
00:26:12,454 --> 00:26:14,115
Kyo! Hurry up!
