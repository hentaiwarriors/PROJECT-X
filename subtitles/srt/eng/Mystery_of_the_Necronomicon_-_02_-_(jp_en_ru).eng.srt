1
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,117
Stop!

2
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:03,932
Ms. Shizui, please help!

3
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,000
Ms. Shizui!

4
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:09,335
My brother is...

5
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:14,208
How many times must I tell you?

6
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:15,679
I didn't do it!

7
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:18,816
Nobody's saying you're the murderer.

8
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:25,322
I want you to tell me honestly
why were you there?

9
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,886
I've already told you many times.

10
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,057
I went to Nezu's room because I
thought he was the prime suspect...

11
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,759
but...

12
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:34,496
He was already dead.
That's what you're claiming?

13
00:01:35,104 --> 00:01:35,729
Yes.

14
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:37,398
This is a bit difficult.

15
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:41,599
If Nezu is the killer...

16
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:44,579
...then who killed him?

17
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:50,082
He can't kill himself and cut off
his own skin afterwards.

18
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,584
Then the suspects in
this resort-condo...

19
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:59,386
are you, Shibusawa the manager,
and Ando in 60B.

20
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:03,461
But the other two have an alibi.

21
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,531
Alibi?

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,534
At 1:30 PM, didn't you go to
Ando's room and ask for his alibi?

23
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,401
Ando called the manager after
you left his room...

24
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:22,414
and complained about the security
system of this condo for 2 hours.

25
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:26,453
We can't find out any more details
until we do a court-ordered autopsy.

26
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:29,285
But the estimated time of his death
was about 4 to 5 hours ago.

27
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:32,453
Which means, around 3 to 4 PM.

28
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,456
That's exactly the same time
you were talking with Nezu.

29
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:43,528
So who do you think is the
most likely suspect?

30
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,229
Care to guess, Mr. Detective?

31
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:46,566
Mr. Hotokeu.

32
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:48,800
The phone is re-connected.

33
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:55,546
It seems like somebody jammed the
phones and cut the outside line.

34
00:02:57,486 --> 00:02:58,953
I found this in the lobby.

35
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,183
I guess, of course, it's not yours?

36
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:04,656
Of course!

37
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:06,153
Who knows?

38
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:10,491
You once were a suspect
in a murder case, weren't you?

39
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:13,932
I got this fax from
the central office!

40
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:19,504
Six years ago, April 30th,
in River Banks, Maine, USA...

41
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,168
A married Japanese couple and a
Caucasian woman were killed...

42
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:24,338
and the skin from
their faces was cut off!

43
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,211
You must have done that too!

44
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:40,862
Was the Caucasian
woman your girlfriend?

45
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:42,055
Wasn't she?

46
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:44,195
You're sweating a lot.

47
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,367
After the incident, you were sent to
the Maine State Mental Institution.

48
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:52,401
A mental institution?

49
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,037
He lost his memory.

50
00:03:54,777 --> 00:04:00,079
Suzusaki had amnesia and lost all his
memory around the time of the murder.

51
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:03,681
He didn't have to face
charges because of that.

52
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:07,544
And he came back
to Japan with a girl.

53
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:08,719
A girl?

54
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:09,720
Yes.

55
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:11,726
Suzusaki brought back the daughter...

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,694
of the Japanese couple
who were murdered.

57
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,855
He adopted her.

58
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:17,565
You must've had guilty feelings?

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,523
No!

60
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,228
It's not because I felt guilty.

61
00:04:20,736 --> 00:04:23,261
Then why did you adopt somebody
who was involved in the murder?!

62
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,736
It's...

63
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,571
I know you can't answer!

64
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:29,937
Was it true that you
lost your memory?!

65
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,911
Can't you even remember one thing?!

66
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,593
Stop!

67
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,088
What's wrong Suzusaki?

68
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,125
Brother!

69
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:52,464
Satoshi.

70
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,108
I'm glad, brother...

71
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:07,638
Oops...

72
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:10,115
I mean Chief...
That you got released.

73
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,550
I haven't been found
innocent and acquitted.

74
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:14,387
There is nothing you
can do about it.

75
00:05:15,124 --> 00:05:17,058
But you have an alibi that
you were with me around...

76
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:19,026
the victim's estimated
time of death.

77
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,992
But it's just the estimated time.

78
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:25,099
Chief could never do such a thing.

79
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:29,497
But the police are convinced he's
the most likely suspect.

80
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,297
I am.

81
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:38,073
When I think calmly, I understand why
I'm their suspect in this situation.

82
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,538
Don't you have any clue?

83
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:46,476
Chief...

84
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,790
About the person
named Naomi Seo in 40A...

85
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:54,253
She might be my classmate
from high school.

86
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,693
What does that mean?

87
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:59,330
We checked out the people in the
condo, this morning...

88
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:02,360
using the computer at the
manager's room on the first floor.

89
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:03,334
Yes.

90
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:05,897
I was wondering
about it since then...

91
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,399
so I checked it over again...

92
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,911
and I found out the fact that
victims Sato and Hiruta...

93
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:15,383
and Naomi are all employees of
M.M. Pharmaceuticals.

94
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:17,183
M.M. Pharmaceuticals?

95
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:22,017
Naomi told me that she would start
working at M.M. after we graduated.

96
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:23,182
I'm sure of it.

97
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:30,030
Yes, can I help you?

98
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:31,931
Naomi!

99
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,025
Asuka!

100
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,930
Naomi it's you!
Long time no see!

101
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:38,096
Yes, what have you been doing?

102
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,903
Oh, Naomi, do you remember him?

103
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:45,036
He's my brother...

104
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:47,114
This is Satoshi Suzusaki.

105
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,422
Oh, I remember this!

106
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,723
The school festival!

107
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:59,258
And this is when
we went to the beach!

108
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:02,490
I remember that's when I met you.

109
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,663
It was lots of fun, wasn't it Naomi?

110
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,459
Yes.

111
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:12,203
What's wrong Naomi?
Is anything bothering you?

112
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:16,868
Yes... I'm afraid.

113
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,074
I don't blame you.

114
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:22,951
Two people from your company
were killed here.

115
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,079
Yes, I'm sorry.

116
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:27,118
No, not at all.

117
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,091
Did you know Sato and Hiruta?

118
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,761
I've never seen them before because
we work in different departments.

119
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:38,090
I see.

120
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:41,968
By the way, why are you
staying at this condo?

121
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:46,298
This is one of the company
facilities for our benefits program.

122
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:50,978
The company suddenly told me
to use my vacation days...

123
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,004
before the end of March.

124
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,852
Do you know about the fire at
the third laboratory yesterday?

125
00:07:59,121 --> 00:07:59,951
What?

126
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:03,725
Somebody named Miura
died in the fire.

127
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,891
I heard it on the 11 o'clock news.

128
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:08,426
I didn't know that it happened.

129
00:08:09,798 --> 00:08:14,326
I'm sorry I don't remember anything.

130
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,432
What?

131
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:17,566
What does that mean?

132
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:21,503
I felt very strange recently.

133
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,672
I often fall asleep all of sudden.

134
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,705
Just like a thread
broke, or I fainted.

135
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:33,117
I was planning to leave here
yesterday. I was packing, and...

136
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,315
I lost consciousness
in the middle of that.

137
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,187
Then I woke up in the morning.

138
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,159
Do you think something's
wrong with me?

139
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:46,799
I think you're just tired.

140
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,063
You must have lots of stress.

141
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:50,501
Yes.

142
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:58,213
Well, I'm very sorry to
bother you so late at night.

143
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,947
Oh, yeah...

144
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:04,352
if you remember something...

145
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:06,411
please call me here.

146
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:07,284
Yes.

147
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,857
Naomi!

148
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:12,258
Do you have a little more time?

149
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:13,022
Yes.

150
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,456
Chief!

151
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,987
I'll stay here and talk
to Naomi a little more.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,763
Because, I haven't
seen her for a long time.

153
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:22,700
Don't take too long.

154
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,362
Yes.

155
00:09:31,046 --> 00:09:33,037
What's wrong, Satoshi?

156
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:37,177
You don't have to worry just because
your intuition was wrong.

157
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,012
Let the police take care of it.

158
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:43,882
I'm sure Nezu killed Hiruta.

159
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:44,722
Huh?

160
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:49,486
The bandage on Nezu's left hand...

161
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,160
That must be a burn he
got when he killed Hiruta.

162
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,900
But Nezu is already dead, because...

163
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:58,799
Satoshi...

164
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:00,067
you must...

165
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,071
What?

166
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:05,340
I'm just joking.

167
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,415
So can we do it again?

168
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:12,013
The price for my information
is very high.

169
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:00,262
I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning.

170
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:05,368
No, by the way, is there anything...
that you remember?

171
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:10,169
I thought about it
again after I saw you...

172
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:14,309
And I decided to tell
you everything.

173
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,640
What is that?

174
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:23,884
I told you that I stayed in my
room around 11:30 last night.

175
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:26,526
However, I was...

176
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,726
actually in Hiruta's room.

177
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:29,795
Huh?

178
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,495
I didn't kill him!

179
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:35,162
Please believe me!

180
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,000
Can you explain any more
details about this?

181
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,509
If you don't mind?

182
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,147
The day before yesterday...

183
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:48,206
The day the Sato's were murdered...

184
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,417
Hiruta told me to
come down to the lobby.

185
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:56,188
The thing Hiruta brought was...

186
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,565
Are you sure?

187
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,858
Just one night...

188
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:10,494
Sure, if you listen to me,
I'll give you back the master tape.

189
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:32,951
No!

190
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,269
When I became conscious...

191
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:50,370
Hiruta was already
dead in the bathtub.

192
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,087
Didn't you see anything else
except Hiruta's body there?

193
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,758
Nozomi was there.

194
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,898
Nozomi! Nozomi!

195
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,674
I understand.

196
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:26,447
He blackmailed
you with this tape.

197
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:27,945
Yes.

198
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,588
Why didn't you call the police?

199
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:39,483
I don't think Hiruta would've
given you the tape...

200
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,519
even if you slept with him one night.

201
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:45,426
The picture I have in my hand is...

202
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,963
Nozomi.

203
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:56,538
I'm a lesbian.

204
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,774
I can only love a woman.

205
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,413
I have been Nozomi's tutor
for a long time, and...

206
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:08,646
I started to love her...

207
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:11,248
I started to love Nozomi, only her.

208
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,726
I don't care what happens to me!

209
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:16,854
But if people know about this...

210
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,768
even if Nozomi is innocent, people
may start to look coldly upon her!

211
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:25,337
I'm...! I'm...!

212
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:29,811
I see.

213
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:32,540
That's why you didn't call the police.

214
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:37,851
Nozomi became stricken with aphasia
when she went to Hiruta's room.

215
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,445
Uh, yes. I guess so.

216
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:45,591
What was Nozomi doing there?

217
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:49,764
Ms. Sakimizu!

218
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:50,765
Police!

219
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,257
Suzusaki!

220
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,465
Oh, you were here.

221
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,333
You! Stay in your own
room and don't move!

222
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:03,470
Don't disturb the investigation!

223
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:05,613
Calm down, Terada.

224
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:06,443
Yes.

225
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:11,817
Ms. Sakimizu, we found this in
Hiruta's room, the man who was killed.

226
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,049
Have you seen this before?

227
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:23,598
I must ask you to accompany me,
voluntarily, to the police station.

228
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,426
I want to ask you
about several things.

229
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:30,435
Nozomi.

230
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:34,473
Nozomi.

231
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:38,402
Mr. Suzusaki, please
take care of Nozomi.

232
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:42,747
Please take care of her
until I come back.

233
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:45,915
Nozomi, please...

234
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:49,784
wait for me at Mr. Suzusaki's
room until I came back.

235
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:52,860
Nozomi, please promise me.

236
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:54,085
Please.

237
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:01,291
Oh, this is slippery.

238
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:02,461
Oh, be careful.

239
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:04,670
Here we go.

240
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,270
Are you all right?

241
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:08,003
Yes.

242
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:09,440
Here we go.

243
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:13,443
Here.

244
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:37,864
Suzusaki!

245
00:16:38,306 --> 00:16:40,297
Oh, manager.

246
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,776
Who is that girl?

247
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:47,206
I feel sorry to leave her alone,
so I'll take her to my place.

248
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:48,941
I see.

249
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:54,450
This condo will finally have some
peace since the murderer got arrested.

250
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,322
Mr. Manager, Sakimizu
is not a murderer.

251
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:03,789
She went to the
police station voluntarily.

252
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:05,632
She'll be back soon.

253
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:08,166
Oh, is that so?

254
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,000
But if Ms. Sakimizu
is not the murderer...

255
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:15,002
I wonder where the
real murderer went?

256
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,546
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you...

257
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:22,412
I'm sorry to tell you
during this situation...

258
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,148
but I'll be going back to my
house at the mountain's base...

259
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,548
when the replacement manager
comes tomorrow.

260
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,558
Mr. Ando will be leaving
with me, too.

261
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,583
This might be the
last time I see you.

262
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,218
I see.

263
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:36,963
I hope we could see
each other, somewhere else...

264
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:38,761
next time under better circumstances.

265
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:39,595
I hope so too.

266
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,497
Well, excuse me.

267
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:46,637
Nozomi...

268
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:49,173
This is Asuka.
She is my assistant.

269
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:53,203
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask her.

270
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:55,275
Nice to meet you, Nozomi.

271
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,585
Asuka, I will sleep
on the sofa for tonight.

272
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:05,889
I will have Nozomi use my room,
so please change the sheets for her.

273
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:06,989
Sure.

274
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:12,160
Nozomi, can you help me
change the sheets?

275
00:18:19,774 --> 00:18:20,468
Yes.

276
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,672
I'm sorry to have you
come here suddenly.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

277
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:25,909
No problem.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

278
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:29,542
You told me there is something
you want to talk to me about.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

279
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:30,612
Yes.

280
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:34,055
I'm scared.

281
00:18:38,293 --> 00:18:40,454
People were killed
within the last 2 days.

282
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:42,961
The people who work in
the same company with me.

283
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:44,391
I understand.

284
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,468
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

285
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,530
I'm very, very scared.

286
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,576
Please make love to me.

287
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:02,246
I was in love with you...

288
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:04,876
since the school festival.

289
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,727
Ms. Seo...

290
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:16,621
I won't be able to see you anymore.

291
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:50,489
What...!

292
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,936
What's wrong with you, Ms. Seo?!

293
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:07,113
Ms. Seo...

294
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,948
What did you make me drink?

295
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:29,203
Ms. Seo.

296
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:42,183
She's dead.

297
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:55,863
Satoshi Suzusaki, you are
in the ultimate pinch!

298
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:57,723
Who are you?

299
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,226
Can you escape from this situation?

300
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:06,203
However, I think you can't do it
the same way as six years ago.

301
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:14,074
You won't lose your memory this time.

302
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:28,423
What happened to me six years ago?

303
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:31,929
Nezu?

304
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:54,076
It's Nezu!

305
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:57,589
Nezu became Shibusawa.

306
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,460
It can't be.

307
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:06,057
Asuka! Nozomi!

308
00:22:08,102 --> 00:22:09,091
Asuka!

309
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,800
Why?

310
00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:19,511
Mukuroiwa!?

311
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,049
This must be a trap.

312
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,314
But I must go.

313
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:33,019
Please be OK...
Asuka! Nozomi!

314
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,868
I'm here!

315
00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:51,306
Come out now, Nezu!

316
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:53,644
Let the girls go!
Let them go!

317
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:55,412
Let them go!

318
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:04,783
Brother...

319
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:07,187
Asuka, Mina!

320
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,990
Don't move, Satoshi!

321
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,289
Nezu is not here anymore.

322
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:16,301
He's already left
somewhere with Nozomi.

323
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,668
Mina, were you Nezu's partner?

324
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:29,783
I sent a fax...

325
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:32,312
telling them that Nezu and I
are the murderers.

326
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:33,377
The murderers?

327
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:35,853
Although...

328
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,454
the person who actually
killed them is Nezu.

329
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,593
I just arranged for you, Hiruta and
everybody to gather at the condo.

330
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:46,761
Then I blew up the laboratory of
M.M. Pharmaceuticals company.

331
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,499
Shizui! Stop it!

332
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:55,565
Why did you take
that girl as a hostage?

333
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,940
Aren't you planning
to turn yourself in?

334
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,411
Don't misunderstand me.

335
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:03,006
I protected Asuka from Nezu.

336
00:24:03,084 --> 00:24:04,210
What do you mean?

337
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,416
Nezu told me...

338
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,889
Nezu told me that you had disturbed
a very important ceremony...

339
00:24:09,924 --> 00:24:11,357
in America six years ago.

340
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:14,524
He held a strong grudge
against Satoshi.

341
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:20,123
So he said he would kill everyone
related to Satoshi... including Asuka.

342
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:23,831
But he only needs
Nozomi at this point.

343
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,703
Why Nozomi?

344
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,209
He told me that he needs
Nozomi for a family circle.

345
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,341
I think you saw it too.

346
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:37,648
Nezu uses strange magic.

347
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,451
He cuts the skin off a human's face,
and impersonates that person.

348
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,518
He controls people's minds
with hypnotism.

349
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:50,391
Nezu is...

350
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:51,989
He is a devil.

351
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:54,395
Why are you working
with such a person?

352
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:56,903
This was the first time
I teamed up with him...

353
00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:00,537
because we have
the same interest.

354
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:03,134
21 years ago...

355
00:25:03,578 --> 00:25:06,103
I worked in the development division
of the M.M. Pharmaceuticals company...

356
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:07,546
along with Hiruta and others.

357
00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:15,082
We were researching to
stop growth hormones.

358
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:20,751
The research related to
human eternal life.

359
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,064
Humans start the aging process
in exchange for their growth.

360
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:30,261
So, we were perfecting growth
restraints on hormones...

361
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:32,295
to give humans eternal life.

362
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:39,241
But the chief of the division was
afraid to continue the research.

363
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:42,811
N... No... Stop!

364
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,877
Are you still insisting to get
away from this research?

365
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,051
Hiruta!

366
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,649
This research violates
the realm of God!

367
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:53,890
Human shouldn't invade this area.

368
00:25:54,228 --> 00:25:55,092
Damn you!

369
00:25:55,463 --> 00:25:58,193
Are you trying to stop us
from making money?

370
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:00,098
Ando! Sato!

371
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:01,192
All right.

372
00:26:01,736 --> 00:26:02,964
Traitor!

373
00:26:03,704 --> 00:26:07,834
This may be the best chance to use
a human body to test the drug.

374
00:26:09,076 --> 00:26:10,134
No!

375
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:13,571
Don't worry, you and
him will be together.

376
00:26:14,148 --> 00:26:16,378
Miura! Make her shut up!

377
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:17,349
A... all right!

378
00:26:18,386 --> 00:26:19,512
Stop!

379
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,588
Please leave her alone!

380
00:26:21,923 --> 00:26:22,685
Shut up!

381
00:26:22,723 --> 00:26:24,850
Why don't you worry about yourself?

382
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,454
How is it?

383
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:33,566
If everything goes well,
you will get eternal life.

384
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:56,415
He's dead.

385
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,485
What are we gonna do now?

386
00:26:58,526 --> 00:26:59,686
Calm down.

387
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:02,830
Nobody knows unless
we talk about this.

388
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,526
We just have to take
care of the witness.

389
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,735
But before that...

390
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:25,243
No!!

391
00:27:32,326 --> 00:27:33,190
S... stop it!

392
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:34,758
Stop!

393
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:38,865
No!

394
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:11,124
They raped me, one after the other,
and then injected the drug in me.

395
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:15,760
But I didn't die.

396
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,504
I couldn't.

397
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:24,268
The unfinished drug, which didn't
work on anybody, worked for us.

398
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,503
Us?

399
00:28:27,214 --> 00:28:29,273
I'm pregnant.

400
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:35,387
The baby hasn't grown for 21 years
and remains as a 2 month old fetus.

401
00:28:35,723 --> 00:28:36,712
It can't be.

402
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:41,656
Since then, I lived as an
underground information broker.

403
00:28:42,363 --> 00:28:44,593
And I met you, Satoshi.

404
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:51,002
I have been waiting for
the day of my revenge.

405
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:56,372
Then I met Nezu through my
underground connections.

406
00:28:56,777 --> 00:29:00,042
Did you have a relationship
with me for revenge?!

407
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,448
Brother!

408
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:11,617
Asuka.

409
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:16,091
Please save Nozomi.

410
00:29:17,164 --> 00:29:20,827
Nezu told me that he would perform
the ceremony on the night of Beltane.

411
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:25,667
I really...

412
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,065
loved you.

413
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,240
No, don't, Mina!

414
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:34,110
Please forgive me... Satoshi.

415
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:35,907
Stop it!

416
00:29:37,284 --> 00:29:38,308
Mina!

417
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,579
Mina!

418
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:49,793
Good bye, Satoshi.

419
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:53,222
Mina!

420
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:58,435
Mina!!!

421
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:13,913
Brother.

422
00:30:19,727 --> 00:30:22,127
Nezu! Where are you?

423
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:24,728
I'll make sure to find you!

424
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:26,727
Wait for me!

425
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:28,300
Toshiaki Nezu!
