1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,460
Mai, you're here?

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,630
Wataru

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:13,840
Mai!

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,810
Do you love me?

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,730
Of course!

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,480
This...

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,440
Mai!

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,240
If you catch me...

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,990
You can do whatever you like

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,580
Good!

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,640
Here

12
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,480
Still... you have no chance

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,520
What's the matter?

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,900
Only I can suit for...

15
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,280
Keinze... Keinze

16
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,910
You're lying, that's just a lie

17
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,540
Stop! Stop...

18
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,550
"Doukyuusei ~ Chapter 2"

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,760
"When summer ends"

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,060
That's a joke

21
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,770
Why would I see that kind of scene in a dream?

22
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,270
Did I eat something rotten?

23
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,150
Seems like she still wants to say something

24
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,070
If you can't get along with Mai

25
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,700
Maybe it's the reason that idiot Katsuya said

26
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,120
Kurumi being with Katsuya, really is a waste...

27
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,440
Anyway

28
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,610
This Friday I can date with Mai finally

29
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,360
I shouldn't care of that little thing

30
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,650
Work hard! Work hard!

31
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,530
If we have the foundation, before the summer ends,

32
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,450
Maybe I can be with Mai...

33
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,160
Keinze this blockhead, always hinder me

34
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,680
Satomi...

35
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,430
Satomi, why are you here?

36
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,610
What's the matter?

37
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,650
I must go back to the swimming pool in school to see Mai now

38
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,130
Mai

39
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,670
Good morning!

40
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,010
Good... good morning! Mr. Moroko

41
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,010
Mai, I beg of you

42
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,810
Don't call me Mr. Moroko anymore, OK?

43
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,600
How can I say... seems like there's a little distance

44
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,400
Calling Wataru or Mr. Wataru should be...

45
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,360
Doesn't it feel much friendlier?

46
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,780
The rumor is true really

47
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,450
Mai, this saying...?

48
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,620
Can't come near to Moroko Wataru within I'm...

49
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,660
This... how could be such a rumor?

50
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,460
Mr. Wataru

51
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,500
Yes

52
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,090
In fact, I want to talk to you long time ago

53
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,880
Really?

54
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,850
So, Friday, we must play very happily

55
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,310
Success!

56
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,280
Welcome

57
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,620
What, it's Wataru

58
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,000
Anything unhappy?

59
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,910
No need to worry, what do you want?

60
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,460
That's it, coffee

61
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,300
Coffee, got it

62
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,010
Please wait for a while

63
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,430
...something bothering you, right?

64
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,640
No such thing, but for Wataru

65
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,600
No matter what you said it can also be accepted, that's true

66
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,390
Come again, haven't ever thought that
I'm a man also?

67
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,730
I don't mean it

68
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,190
But... since secondary school

69
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,440
I've known you for 6 years already...

70
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,400
If we meet in common situation, it should be that

71
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,490
We would have at least 1 to 2 sex relationships

72
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,330
Not exactly! You're so young that
you already indulged yourself

73
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,290
Isn't it too foolish?

74
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,620
Discussion finished

75
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,870
Keep on saying

76
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,170
Satomi, would you give me one more cup of coffee?

77
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,420
Yes

78
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,470
Wataru, you really like Mai?

79
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,800
Even be infatuated

80
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,260
Right

81
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,390
That's trouble

82
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,310
Is the relationship of that girl with Keinze good?

83
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,060
That guy has no relation with her

84
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,730
Yes

85
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
But... why would you talk about this?

86
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,700
No...

87
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,200
If saying so

88
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,570
When I saw you at the river side this morning

89
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,830
Seems like you're laden with anxiety...

90
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,120
Nothing

91
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,830
Understand! You're jealous about Mai and me

92
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,210
Idiot

93
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,590
Really!
No solution to Kurumi's childish

94
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:24,710
Right?

95
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,710
Damn it!

96
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,130
Is it because he did something disgusting to her?

97
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,220
Forcing her too much?

98
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,720
Forget it, what should I do?

99
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,600
The most important thing is are you treating her heartily?

100
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,850
Pretending to be silly again?

101
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,350
You can't do what Kurumi want

102
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,270
Then you'll never understand her at all in your life

103
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,650
Also one time...

104
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
Even her father appeared saying to me

105
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,030
"What you wanna do with my daughter"

106
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,120
Even said so to me!

107
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,700
Really?

108
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,540
OK... decided! Then I give up on Kurumi

109
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,000
Find a more mature woman!

110
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,920
What should you do about Kurumi?

111
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,420
Not my business!

112
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,720
Then even no problem to give her to me?

113
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,630
Up to you!

114
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,680
Bye

115
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,690
Forget it, he...

116
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,440
A while later he will...

117
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,030
Satomi and Keinze...

118
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,550
Then... I can't see Mai

119
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,600
Is there something wrong with Mai today?

120
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,140
Should it be it, she's sick...

121
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,770
You won't see Mai anymore

122
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,310
What are you saying?

123
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,440
Tomorrow I'll go with Mai to...

124
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,490
What's your relationship with Mai?

125
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,620
Not your business!

126
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,330
Anyway, you can't get close to Mai anymore

127
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,130
MASTER, is Satomi here?

128
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,630
She called back and said...

129
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,010
Today I'm sick, I need rest

130
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,260
Such a rare thing happens?

131
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,680
Have you felt that Satomi is a little bit strange recently?

132
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,020
Don't know why

133
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,480
Bleeding a little after broken something

134
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,690
Then she keep silence...

135
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,560
Also one time

136
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,860
She poured coffee on customer's suit

137
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,320
Really trouble

138
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,780
Is it him...?

139
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,700
That's it, you know why?

140
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,240
No...

141
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,910
Wait, Wataru!

142
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,870
You must know something?

143
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,090
I don't know, how could I not know the business of that guy?

144
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,840
Yes... But I'm really worry about her

145
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,970
Welcome

146
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,010
Kurimi! What's happened?

147
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,060
Wataru!

148
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,100
I...

149
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,480
Kurumi... Kurumi

150
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,530
Katsuya is very cool recently?

151
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,540
What...

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,870
You shouldn't cry so loud just for such thing?

153
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,290
But! Even he doesn't talk with me when I'm dating with him

154
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,380
When I call him, he always says he has something to do

155
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,420
Just as he doesn't want to see me

156
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,550
This idiot! Seems serious

157
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,790
I...

158
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,560
Not long ago, he took me to a hotel

159
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,520
Is that why he's unhappy being refused by me?

160
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,480
This...

161
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,900
No! No! No!

162
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,610
How could it because this, Kurumi?

163
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,360
Since Katsuya didn't comforted by you, Kurumi

164
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,280
If so Kurumi, you should show your smile

165
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,030
Katsuya will be very gentle at once!

166
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,370
Really?

167
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,120
I believe in Katsuya totally!

168
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,380
That's it

169
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,930
The affair between man and woman is always tangled up!

170
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,640
I can't distinguish it also

171
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,440
How come?

172
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,650
I...

173
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,770
Wait! Please listen to me!

174
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:12,960
Satomi

175
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,340
Wataru

176
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,720
What's the matter? It's rare to see you look sad

177
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,480
Satomi...

178
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,690
What's the matter?

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,440
Last night, at the coffee shop, in front of game center

180
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,360
I saw you talked with Keinze

181
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,690
What did you say?

182
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,740
No... we just met coincidentally on street

183
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,580
Bye

184
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,660
So soon...

185
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,000
Anyway, I'm free...

186
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,500
Wataru

187
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,040
MASTER, what's the matter?

188
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,550
Big event!

189
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,970
Have you seen Satomi?

190
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,890
Satomi? You haven't seen her?

191
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,640
That kid disappeared!

192
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,600
Since she hasn't come to the shop this morning.

193
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,730
So I'm worry about her

194
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,890
I called her home

195
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,610
Her mother even said she went out to work

196
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,030
If anything happened, it would be trouble

197
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,190
Will you help find Satomi?

198
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,610
Now I've something to do

199
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,370
Please! Mr. Wataru!

200
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,290
I understand...

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,750
Don't know what I'm doing...

202
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,320
Wait...

203
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,500
Satomi? Have you seen her today?

204
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,080
Really, didn't see her?

205
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,000
Have you seen her?

206
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,260
What happened? That kid...

207
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,130
No! Nothing!

208
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,300
Bye

209
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,380
Satomi... MASTER is worried about you very much

210
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,470
Let's contact with him...

211
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,450
Satomi... maybe I'm too involved...

212
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,210
You and Keinze...

213
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,080
Don't care of me!

214
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,260
Sorry... please... let me be alone

215
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,470
Satomi...

216
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,480
Finally caught up

217
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,610
Girls always have to spend more time to dress up

218
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,450
It must be I've said the wrong time...

219
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,920
Yes, Sakuraki's home

220
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,420
Excuse me... I'm Maroko, is Mai home?

221
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,430
She said before starting school,

222
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,300
she won't meet with you definitely

223
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,350
She won't do that kind of low grade dating

224
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,720
Sorry!

225
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,180
May I ask...

226
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,270
Why is that?

227
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,080
Mai...

228
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,150
Mai...

229
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,980
Mai...

230
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,820
What's the matter?

231
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:36,960
So noisy!

232
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,890
Wataru is out now

233
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,060
After the "Beep" sound, please...

234
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,930
Wataru...

235
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,310
Satomi?!

236
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,350
Sorry for calling you so late

237
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,350
No, it doesn't matter

238
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,860
Thank you for this afternoon.
I'm very happy...

239
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,200
Wataru, I...

240
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Satomi, where are you now?

241
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,090
That?

242
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,550
Satomi

243
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,190
Satomi

244
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,610
Thanks... Wataru, you worry a lot about me

245
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,530
I really haven't think of it...

246
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,590
No...

247
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,360
Have you contacted MASTER?

248
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,990
You gave everybody so much troubles...

249
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,740
Really sorry.

250
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,580
Satomi

251
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,710
Wataru... I've been dumped by Keinze...

252
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,090
I really like him so much

253
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,510
But as a result...

254
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,270
He loves another girl again

255
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,690
Other... girl...

256
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,860
Hug me! Wataru!

257
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,280
Satomi...

258
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,240
Please! Help me forget him

259
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,950
Doing so... is it really OK?

260
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,750
Only you can do that

261
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,180
You're so beautiful... Satomi

262
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,440
So happy

263
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,770
Make me forget all the things...

264
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,000
Satomi...

265
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,950
So great

266
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,010
Satomi...

267
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,510
I'm very happy

268
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,760
Let's make me forget all the things...

269
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,540
Wataru...

270
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,630
Satomi... I almost

271
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,210
I also coming

272
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,560
Bye, take rest soon

273
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,320
Wataru! I...

274
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,700
Next time, when I come to the coffee shop

275
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,200
You have to make coffee for me!

276
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,540
Thank you, Wataru
