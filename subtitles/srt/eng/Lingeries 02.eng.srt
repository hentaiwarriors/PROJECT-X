1
00:00:10,857 --> 00:00:12,791
It came out pretty good.

2
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:18,094
I can't believe you're making me do
this, you pervert!

3
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:23,600
Call me an artist.
Besides, it makes a great souvenir.

4
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:25,737
Whatever you say.

5
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:29,171
Hey, behave yourself!

6
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:34,344
So, the girl I asked you about...

7
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,574
so what can you tell me about her?

8
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:45,149
Chisa Sakurai from Research
and Development, right?

9
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:50,425
Are you going to hit on her like this, too?

10
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:55,259
Don't jump to conclusions.

11
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:58,098
I wanted to ask for her help with this
new line we're designing.

12
00:00:58,438 --> 00:00:59,427
Liar.

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,574
I know you already.

14
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:15,216
But, it's okay.
Let me tell you something else.

15
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:21,885
She looks really demure,
but she's got a real...

16
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:27,732
nympho side-once you get her going.

17
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:31,098
- What is that, women's intuition?
- Something like that.

18
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:33,639
Thanks, that's good information to have.

19
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:35,766
Yes!

20
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:38,334
- Yusuke, I want...
- Already?

21
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:40,972
You want something in return
for your advice?

22
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:48,646
Is this what you had in mind, Alice?

23
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:03,631
LINGERIE CLUB VOL 2

24
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,004
Zaitu?

25
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:19,479
You're here late. Working overtime?

26
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:21,646
Yes.

27
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:24,321
So, do you have time
free for me sometime?

28
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:26,958
You and me?

29
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:29,687
Yeah, we're working
on a new design at section 2...

30
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:32,262
so I wanted some help
from the advertising department.

31
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:36,368
I think you'll need to make
a sample to...

32
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,700
show me first before
I can do anything for you.

33
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:49,248
The best brain in the advertisement
department, Rena Masaoka...

34
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:52,919
together with Miki's trusted,
Zaitu from planning section 1...

35
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:57,355
it would appear she's part
of the Vice President's faction.

36
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:12,637
How do you like it?

37
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:16,468
You are wet like a fountain,
you must be loving it.

38
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:22,743
Yes! I love it! I love it! More!

39
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:26,418
Look at you!

40
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:30,120
So many people at work admire you
for your business sense...

41
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:34,694
but in reality you're a dumb slut, aren't you?
Admit it.

42
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:36,722
You fucking whore.

43
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,331
I want more! Harder, deeper!

44
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:01,953
I like it!
I think this design is perfect!

45
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:05,216
Really? Thank you so much!

46
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:07,883
No thank you. Great job guys!

47
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:09,461
Thank you! I'm so happy.

48
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:12,826
I knew seamless lingerie would work.

49
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:16,630
You always give good advice.

50
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:21,239
Usually, a bra leaves marks
on the skin right here.

51
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:24,274
And panties are always a problem...

52
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:30,805
binding and marking here and here,
and right where the garter belt lays. See?

53
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,713
Hey, Mayumi!

54
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,183
My gosh! What am I doing?
I'll get some tea!

55
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:57,874
Mr. Nakanishi!

56
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:02,045
You scared me! What are you doing here?

57
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,484
My bad. I didn't mean to scare you.

58
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:08,951
- I'm sorry.
- I shouldn't be so jumpy.

59
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:14,259
I wasn't expecting anyone else to be here.
I though I'd finish my work.

60
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:21,391
About the new designs section 2 came up
with. Will you make a sample of them?

61
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:26,267
What? I told you I couldn't help you!
I'm too busy for any of that.

62
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,974
I've got my own work to finish.

63
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:34,739
Come on, don't be like that.

64
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:40,009
Relax, working in the dark like this,
all by your self...

65
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,084
you need a break...

66
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:45,156
is there a reason
why you need the lights off?

67
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:50,161
Well?

68
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,857
If I remember it correctly,
we need to get permission...

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,434
to use the office after business hours.

70
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:02,774
I'm sure such an honest person like you
wouldn't forget something like that.

71
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,541
So, what about the sample?

72
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:09,442
You'll take of it, won't you?
My beautiful baby.

73
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,750
Like I said.

74
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:18,557
Mr. Nakanishi! Stop that,
or I'll call security.

75
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:21,587
Come on! Just say yes.

76
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:24,155
Please stop!

77
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,301
Hey, is someone in there?

78
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:33,665
It's me, Nakanishi
from the planning department!

79
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:39,006
The new chief of section 2!
Everything okay?

80
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:43,816
I'm looking for some data for our new
design. I heard it's somewhere in here.

81
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:47,443
I'm still a rookie here,
so I've got a lot to learn.

82
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:52,920
Stop.

83
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:57,553
I see. It's easy to work hard when you're
looking at panties all day.

84
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:02,533
You got that right! I'm almost done, though.
Sorry to bother you!

85
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:08,973
Don't worry about that!
You can stay as long as you need to.

86
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:12,008
Just make sure you
lock the door when you leave.

87
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:15,147
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Thanks!

88
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:20,577
Why are you hiding under there?

89
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:23,756
You rotten bastard!

90
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:30,054
Be quiet! That guard might come back.

91
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:32,926
You've got to keep your mouth shut!

92
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:41,030
These are some of biggest I've ever
seen. Amazing.

93
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:43,470
No!

94
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,469
No, stop!

95
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,403
Please stop!

96
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:55,452
Don't look at me!

97
00:07:58,057 --> 00:07:59,854
This is interesting.

98
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:02,922
What do you call this right here,
Miss Sakurai?

99
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:06,923
I don't know.

100
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:15,105
Hey, what's going on down there?
How come you're so wet?

101
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:20,644
Please stop, please!

102
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,819
I can't take it anymore, please stop.

103
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,470
Mr. Nakanishi, Please let me go.

104
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:56,839
I can't take this humiliation anymore!

105
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,178
- No!
- You can come out now.

106
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,151
This is how you get people
to do your work?

107
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:09,628
Fine, then.

108
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:14,133
I'll work on the sample for you.
But I need something in return.

109
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,265
In return from me?

110
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:21,599
Recently, the engineering department's
network server was hacked by someone.

111
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:22,604
What?

112
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:26,001
Hey, you're not trying to trick me
or anything, are you?

113
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,712
I'm very serious.

114
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:32,874
But, it's clear the hacking was an internal
job someone within the company...

115
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,849
and I'll find out who it was!

116
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:37,756
In order to do so...

117
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:39,984
I need a completely independent
network server...

118
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:42,254
that's fully separated from our company.

119
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:46,125
But it's too much to deal with on my own.
That's where I need your help.

120
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:51,329
What kind of money are we talking about?
That's what you need from me, right?

121
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:55,437
About $30,000.

122
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:57,371
$30,000!

123
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,875
That won't come out of my pocket.

124
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:03,608
I don't want an outsider coming in
and messing with our technology!

125
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,583
Even if that person is from our company!
I've got my pride.

126
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:12,154
Okay, I understand, just relax.

127
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:14,121
Do you think you can help me?

128
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:18,592
I think I can do something about it.

129
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:21,392
Just, don't forget
about the samples, okay? 'Bye.

130
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:25,131
Mr. Nakanishi.

131
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,717
Hacking into R& D interesting.

132
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:43,488
Alice wasn't kidding, that Chisa Sakurai
does have a nympho side.

133
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,624
So, R&D is his next target?

134
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:59,497
Yes, it would appear so,
as far as I can tell.

135
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:16,718
- He is getting in our way.
- I agree.

136
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:34,562
Morning everyone!

137
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:37,469
I can't believe it.
Did you know Mr. Nakanishi...

138
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:40,341
convinced R&D to make our samples?

139
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:43,446
That's our Boss, you know!

140
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:47,009
He could really save our section.

141
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:50,452
But people on above him must really
hate him, though.

142
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:53,249
It's so obvious.

143
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:54,658
Why?

144
00:11:55,061 --> 00:12:00,556
Because, Fujiyama at personnel was the
one who headhunted Mr. Nakanishi.

145
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:04,562
And Mr. Fujiyama is in league
with the President's faction.

146
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:05,832
So there.

147
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:11,068
Nakanishi has become quite a nuisance
for the Vice President's faction.

148
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:13,905
I hope he'll come out
of this alright, through.

149
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,553
Hi there.

150
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,588
How long have you been standing
there looking up my dress?

151
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:32,455
As long as seemed appropriate.

152
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:34,825
So, what do you want?
Can I help you?

153
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:37,935
I think we are almost done with making
the samples for our new design...

154
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:41,232
I thought you could help me
with that advertising now.

155
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,905
- So you didn't hear about it, then?
- What?

156
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:51,212
Chisa Sakurai from R&D was dismissed
as the R&D supervisor today.

157
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:54,186
Every project she was working on...

158
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:57,484
and all her previous responsibilities
were taken away from her.

159
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:00,017
It's really too bad, don't you think?

160
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,191
It's really too bad.

161
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:15,731
Fuck! This is no good.

162
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,254
Mr. Nakanishi.

163
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:31,112
Sorry about what happened.

164
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,516
No. I'm sorry.

165
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,288
I couldn't finish the sample for you.

166
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:43,463
It's my fault. They told me I was
disturbing the workplace...

167
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:48,167
because my work here
has been entirely self-gratifying.

168
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:51,174
They said I'm a cancer in the department!

169
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:57,910
I've slaved so hard for this company.

170
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:04,955
All I've really done
is make trouble for everyone.

171
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:09,622
Especially you, Mr. Nakanishi. I'm sorry.

172
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:13,896
I feel terrible about this,
but I really needed that money.

173
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,800
I have bills to pay, I really trusted
what you were doing.

174
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:23,341
I know. I'm terribly sorry.

175
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:27,510
I'm not saying you have to pay back
the money right away or anything...

176
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:31,376
but at least don't ruin
the new designs for our section.

177
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:36,284
I even had to lie to security,
that was difficult for me to do.

178
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,449
I'll do anything to make it up to you.

179
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:47,195
Don't move.

180
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:53,905
See, the sample needs
to fit your body just right. Beautiful.

181
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:06,583
Look, this part right here especially
needs to be more relaxed.

182
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,350
With our new design,
getting into a position like this...

183
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,324
will be so much more comfortable.

184
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,895
This seam right here.
Do you know what I mean?

185
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:18,827
I can't do this.

186
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:24,302
Look how tightly the seam is pulling
from the thigh to your buttocks.

187
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:26,763
Don't move!

188
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:29,340
And this is the most important point,
right here?

189
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,609
Are you getting wet over this?

190
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:34,838
Well are you?

191
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:38,482
No! It's not like that! Please stop!

192
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:43,752
Please stop!

193
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,890
I said don't' move!

194
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,251
Damn, you really are getting wet.

195
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:51,961
Not just wet, but drenched!

196
00:15:58,738 --> 00:15:59,762
Scream!

197
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:05,577
I can't believe people
think you're so innocent.

198
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:13,242
Stop already, please let me go!

199
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,586
Yeah!

200
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:32,231
I guess I'll let you go, then.
For the day.

201
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,931
What, you mean I'm not forgiven yet?

202
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:38,176
Of course not. I need another favor.

203
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:39,541
What?

204
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,009
Keep working on you hacking investigation.

205
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:45,440
You want to know who responsible
for this, don't you?

206
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:48,345
Well, yeah. Of course.

207
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:51,722
Then find out who did this, okay?

208
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,185
Yes, Sir!

209
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,858
- Take care of it, okay?
- All right.

210
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:06,394
- Mr. Nakanishi?
- Hey, there.

211
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:09,165
Tell me, how are those designs coming?

212
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:12,935
- Well, things are certainly interesting.
- Interesting?

213
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:15,544
Yeah, extremely.

214
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:21,512
By the way, I'll need you help with
some advertising like we discussed.

215
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:23,087
I'll need it soon.

216
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,054
But...

217
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:28,125
But what?

218
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:30,084
Nothing.

219
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:33,290
And if it's all right, let's meet alone.

220
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:36,868
There are some things
I need to talk to you about.

221
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,534
Sure.

222
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,105
In that case, how's you next day off?

223
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:45,341
Next day off? That should be fine.

224
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:49,207
I'll leave the time and place up to you.
Well, see you then.

225
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:53,310
I can hardly wait.

226
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,190
Good night, boss!
See you tomorrow!

227
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:04,687
Okay, guys. See you!

228
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:07,858
Boss?

229
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,802
Hey, Mayumi, It's time to go home!

230
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:19,404
I heard this rumor,
that R&D dismissed Miss Sakurai.

231
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:20,601
Am I right?

232
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,140
What about it?

233
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:26,150
So, what's going to happen to our
seamless lingerie designs?

234
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:28,015
Don't even worry about that!

235
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:31,682
- Well, I sort of am.
- Just trust me.

236
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:40,788
I was worried because
everyone's saying different things.

237
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,824
What do you mean "different things?"

238
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,967
Well, I heard some people saying that
recent movement in the company's share...

239
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:53,712
performance looks like there's some kind
of stock manipulation going on.

240
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:58,444
But I'm sure it 's all silly rumors!

241
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:01,819
You shouldn't pay too much attention
to what people say.

242
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:05,881
- Of course. See you tomorrow, then!
- All right, then, Mayumi!

243
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:12,355
So, the stock market?

244
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:53,963
Sorry to interrupt
such a precious moment.

245
00:19:57,676 --> 00:19:58,938
How's it going?

246
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:01,406
I've almost got it.

247
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:04,843
Here it is!

248
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:11,548
- But this ID is...
- Who is it?

249
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:15,791
This is section 1 chief
Mr. Zaitu's ID number.

250
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,895
That's what it is!

251
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:24,733
Wait! The ID number is Mr. Zaitu's,
but the pass code belongs to...

252
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:26,270
What's wrong?

253
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:28,865
No! It can't be!

254
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:35,206
There must be some
kind of mistake. Why!

255
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:39,814
No, it can't be Mr. Miki!

256
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:44,947
So, the hacker was Mr. Miki then.

257
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,783
He used to work as engineer, like me.

258
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:51,253
How I respected him!

259
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:57,025
I wanted to be like him!
How could he betray us?

260
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:07,970
Are you okay now?

261
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,179
Yes, thank you.
Well, Mr. Nakanishi?

262
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:15,448
Yes, Chisa?

263
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:19,889
I have something I want to show you.
I think you'll be pleased.

264
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:29,326
Chisa, you're...

265
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:38,109
I finished your sample.
Do you like it?

266
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,734
You finished it?

267
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:41,780
Yes.

268
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:44,040
It's amazing!
You've really saved section 2!

269
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:46,242
Chisa, you're wonderful.

270
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:51,016
I did it not because I promised you
I would...

271
00:21:51,223 --> 00:21:54,954
but I also really liked the design
when I first saw it.

272
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:58,325
Really? Thank you.

273
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:01,397
I think it came out pretty close
to how I imagined.

274
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:05,332
I think this is way more
than I imagined!

275
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:08,773
It's just amazing.

276
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:12,171
I was thinking of you
when I first saw this design.

277
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:15,576
I knew it would fit your incredible
body perfectly.

278
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:29,291
Such a beautiful cock!

279
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:02,958
How are my breasts, Mr. Nakanishi?

280
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:07,659
Unreal! I could tit-fuck you all night!

281
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,562
Thank you!

282
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:12,235
I love your hot prick between my tits!

283
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:15,333
Chisa, I'm about to...

284
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:17,773
Come on me, please! Come!

285
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:35,255
Your nipples are so hard and tight!
Do you like it rough like this?

286
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:42,892
I guess you love it like this.

287
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:48,196
No! I'm not that kind of girl!

288
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:52,202
I'm afraid these nipples
make it look like you're lying.

289
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:55,639
But I'm not a slut! No!

290
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:09,087
How does this work for you, Chisa?

291
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:20,332
I don't know.

292
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:25,173
It's so fucking good!

293
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:28,235
No!

294
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:33,050
No? What do you mean, "no?"

295
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,544
You're almost there, aren't you?

296
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:40,056
You need to ask permission to come,
or I don't think I'll let you.

297
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:45,425
Don't you have something to ask?

298
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:49,559
Okay. That's it, then.

299
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:51,600
No. Don't stop.

300
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:56,099
Then beg for it!
Say, "please make me come all the way."

301
00:24:57,242 --> 00:25:02,373
Please, I'm so close!
I need your...

302
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:05,672
Come on.

303
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,348
You need my what?

304
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:14,323
I want your cock inside me!
Please! Make me come! Fuck me!

305
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:17,952
Good girl.

306
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:23,667
Yes! Yes! Please let me come!

307
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:27,167
I'm coming, yes!

308
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,349
I'm coming!

309
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,725
Mr. Nakanishi?

310
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:58,803
Do you hate slutty girls?

311
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,704
No. I love them.

312
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:04,264
Good.
