1
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,040
The grounds
are really bright.

2
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,770
They're really bright for
this early in the morning.

3
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,810
Yeah...

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,290
I didn't hear from you for a while.
What were you up to?

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,250
Nothing special.

6
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,780
Like hell! You and Norikazu
went off somewhere, didn't you?

7
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,060
He wasn't at school
either while you were gone.

8
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,000
C'mon,
where'd you two go?

9
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,200
Midori, tell me where.

10
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,440
Midori...
Midori, what's with you?

11
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,980
I'm not saying!

12
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,940
Midori!

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,410
Oh, for Heaven's sake!

14
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,620
Good morning to you...

15
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,790
Professor.

16
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,150
How might I help you?

17
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,230
Yukimoto!
How could you write this?!

18
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,100
How could I write what?

19
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,730
Read it yourself.

20
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,040
Question: In 200 words,
discuss the basis of...

21
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,210
...the twelve note musical scale
of the late Romantic period.

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,410
Answer: Professor Saiki, as I
look at your figure from behind...

23
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,890
...as you administer this exam,
I write for you this answer.

24
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,580
Your long hair, your perfect skin,
your bewitching gaze...

25
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,920
Just thinking about them
sets my heart on fire!

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,550
Your lips...

27
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,930
Your lips, so carefully rouged
into so full a smile...

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,230
How many men have
longed for those lips?

29
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,030
That's not what you wrote!

30
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,940
That lewd little mouth of
yours was really asking...

31
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,070
..."How many men have
those 'lips' sent to Heaven!"

32
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:08,280
Oh Dean...! Stop it!
Oh god... Don't...

33
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,020
How did you...

34
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,720
How did you get that?!

35
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,230
Professor...
Would you please disrobe?

36
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,010
What did you just say?

37
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,040
Stop it!
Turn the tape off.

38
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,810
Professor,
please disrobe.

39
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,300
Professor, you're still
wearing something.

40
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,900
Yukimoto, please.
Don't do this.

41
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,080
Stop it!
Turn it off!

42
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,550
Yukimoto,
don't do this to me.

43
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,420
Please move
your hands, Professor.

44
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,540
Such large breasts.
A 36" bust, to be sure.

45
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,840
How many men have
squeezed them?

46
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,610
No, don't...

47
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,440
Professor, be so kind as
to move your other hand.

48
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,110
Now then,
spread your legs apart.

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,690
Why, Professor!
Getting wet so soon?

50
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,750
Please, don't say that.

51
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,130
Now then,
please play the piano.

52
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,780
Yukimoto, what are you...?!

53
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,160
Professor, your hands have a
job to do. Continue the recital.

54
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,750
Professor, your nipples
are this hard already?

55
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,390
Don't say that.

56
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,530
Yu- Yukimoto, not there!

57
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,200
Spread your legs, please.

58
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,430
No!

59
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,710
Now move your hips.

60
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,920
No... Stop it!

61
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,730
Professor,
your recital is suffering.

62
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,400
Yukimoto, I can't...

63
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,750
Yukimoto, no!

64
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,660
Professor...

65
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,680
How many men have
been inside of you?

66
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,940
No! Don't say
things like that.

67
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,870
Yukimoto, no.

68
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,280
A teacher and a student can't...
Please, stop.

69
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,880
But it's all right for a
teacher and the Dean to do it?

70
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,020
That was... Don't!

71
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,460
Professor,
I'm about to release.

72
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,560
No, not inside me!

73
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,870
Well, then you shouldn't be
holding it in so tightly.

74
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,040
Don't say...
Oh god, I'm going to...!

75
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,320
No! Pull it out!

76
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,320
I'm... I'm...
Oh god!

77
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,600
Good morning, everyone!

78
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,160
And now for the
morning announcements.

79
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,610
Very good, Professor.

80
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,910
How many men have
you practiced on?

81
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,350
No, you can't rest yet.

82
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,890
Here it comes.

83
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,160
No!

84
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,370
No!

85
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,550
Midori...

86
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,130
Midori...

87
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,570
I'm going to...!

88
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,740
Midori...

101
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,040

Supernatural Beast Battlefront
ADVENTURE KID 3 The Miracle Love Potion

106
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,690
I'm dying!
You're killing me!

107
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,620
Interesting idea, Dakiniten.

108
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,960
If you, a Lady of hell,
were to die...

109
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,370
...just where exactly
would you end up?

110
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,470
Sire, some news...

111
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,700
What?! My son is
a slave to a human?!

112
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,880
Look at this, Sire.

113
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,380
What?!

114
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,650
In addition, she refers to
him by the lowly name of "Horny. "

115
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,820
The noble name of
Kingan is denied him...

116
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,020
...and replaced with "Horny?!"
Unforgivable!

117
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,850
YES!

118
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,200
Mephisto!
Is Mephisto here?

119
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:00,200
So, Mephisto. You've been with
me for 500 years, haven't you?

120
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,220
And I am filled with gratitude
for your majesty's good will.

121
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,450
Here's your chance
to regain your freedom.

122
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,420
Go to the human world
and bring back the prince.

123
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,580
I must humbly suggest that Mephisto
is unsuited for this responsibility.

124
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,620
500 years ago, he allowed the
master demon alchemist to escape.

125
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,570
All because he was
distracted by a woman.

126
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,500
If you fail,
you forfeit your life!

127
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,110
Because I'll be sending
him after you, next!

128
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,180
But since Eganko's left...

129
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,080
...the doorway to the
human world is sealed.

130
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,720
Why don't I try to
break that seal open?

131
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,220
These thighs let Eganko into
this world when she was born.

132
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,320
Tell me, boy... Do you have
what it takes to get in here?

133
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,650
So, how does it feel to wear only
your birthday suit, Professor?

134
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,760
Yukimoto, please.
Give me back my clothes!

135
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,390
I've brought a wonderful
outfit for you.

136
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,490
Please put this on.

137
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,870
Yukimoto...! You seriously
expect me to wear this?!

138
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,840
Put it on, Professor.

139
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,660
The collar as well,
Professor.

140
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,870
Now turn around, please.

141
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,710
Yukimoto,
what are you...?!

142
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,380
Yukimoto...?

143
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,880
Stick it out a
bit more, Professor.

144
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,830
Professor, you're
already getting wet?

145
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,660
Don't...
It's embarrassing...

146
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,730
Professor,
a bit wider, please.

147
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,500
Professor, do you ever
play with yourself?

148
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,740
No, I don't do
things like that.

149
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,150
Well then,
do you play with toys?

150
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,050
What?

151
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,850
Yukimoto...!

152
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,290
Professor, liars always
get punished in the end.

153
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,190
Yukimoto, stop it!

154
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,790
No! Don't!

155
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,450
You seem to be enjoying this.
Why don't I leave it in?

156
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,990
Yukimoto.

157
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,130
No... Oh no...

158
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,940
Do you like it, Professor?
Shall I leave it like this?

159
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,980
No, Yukimoto...
Stop it...

160
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,980
No! Stop it!
I'm going to...!

161
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,120
Stop! Stop it!
I'm almost...!

162
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,620
I can't help it!

163
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,990
I'm... OH!

164
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,280
Professor, don't hog
the fun all to yourself.

165
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,840
I'd like a bit
of that as well.

166
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,950
Taste good,
Professor?

167
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,030
Here's your reward.

168
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,270
Please continue,
Professor.

169
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,040
Midori...

170
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,040
If only this
was Midori, instead.

171
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,790
Professor, I'm about ready.
Swallow all of it when it comes.

172
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,330
Professor...!

173
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,520
Midori!

174
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,420
Norio!
On your way home?

175
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,080
No, it's test prep
class, for me.

176
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,750
Killer.
And it's Summer, too.

177
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,660
Say, Midori.
Do you like the opera?

178
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,660
I've two tickets to
the Met for tonight.

179
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,360
Care to join me?

180
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,240
Sorry, but I have plans.
Today's Norikazu's birthday.

181
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,510
And I bet that's a homemade
cake for him you've got there.

182
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,070
Bingo!

183
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:15,050
Too bad. Guess I'll use the
other seat for my bag of textbooks.

184
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,350
Sorry I can't join you.
See you tomorrow!

185
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,790
Midori...

186
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:27,860
As much as I care for you...
What do you see in Hanyu?!

187
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,430
Hey... Cut it out!

188
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,270
C'mon, let's pick
up where we left off.

189
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,370
If she hadn't butted in that time,
we could've gone all the way.

190
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,250
But, that was just...!
Hey!

191
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,880
THIS part of
you's being honest.

192
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,890
Happy birthday-

193
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,230
Midori!

194
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,400
Oh, Norikazu.

195
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,840
Norikazu...

196
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,900
Norikazu, I HATE YOU!

197
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,100
Midori!

198
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,170
Norikazu, wait!

199
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,860
And he had so
much to give me...

200
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,090
Norikazu,
you stupid jerk!

201
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,930
Midori!
Midori, wait up!

202
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,870
We used to play together
when we were little...

203
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,940
I used to dream about growing
up and marrying you.

204
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,220
I've always loved you...

205
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,780
And now... Now...!

206
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,510
How dare you make
the mistress cry!

207
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,060
What the hell is that?!

208
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,290
You let Horny crawI
around in your shirt?!

209
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,560
But he asked if
he could ride in there...

210
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,860
And I suppose you'd let him
into your panties if he asked?!

211
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,230
What's that supposed to mean?!
You stupid jerk!

212
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,900
- To hell with you!
- Midori!

213
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,460
Midori...

214
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,230
Looks like she's asleep.
Poor kid.

215
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,460
Your highness, why won't you
come back to hell with me?

216
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,870
'Cause I LIKE this lifestyle!

217
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,870
Nothing wrong with being
this cutie's slave, no sir!

218
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,910
I get to slip
into her cleavage...

219
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,680
...and wander around in some
even more interesting places.

220
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,650
Lemme show you
something cool.

221
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,280
Umm, love that smell!
Lookit this!

222
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,690
God, I love
touching this thing!

223
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,530
Hey, wanna give this a try?

224
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,900
Do you wanna look in here?
Huh? Mephisto?

225
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,840
You saw me?

226
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,380
Jerk!

227
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,730
Eganko!

228
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,730
You're pretty well
in the mood, I see.

229
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,740
This is just...

230
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,670
C'mon... Let's pick
up where we left off.

231
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,080
- No!
- C'mon.

232
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,610
No! I only love Midori!

233
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,520
And thanks to you,
our relationship's shot to shit!

234
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,710
Get out of my life!
I hate you!

235
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,760
I never want
to see you again!

236
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,320
Norikazu...

237
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,090
The hell with you!

238
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,040
Mom!

239
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,410
Oh! Eganko!
Something wrong?

240
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,310
I just needed
to hear your voice.

241
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,050
I always feel better
when I talk to you.

242
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,720
- Where are you?
- The human world.

243
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,020
The human world?!
Have you been with the prince?

244
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,620
Prince? Oh, Kingan.
Yeah, I guess.

245
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,030
Mephisto's there
to bring him back.

246
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,870
Mephisto's here, too?

247
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,410
So, how are the men
in the human world?

248
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,410
Bet you've got 'em
lined up for you.

249
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,140
Well... There's this girl
who's screwing it up for me.

250
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,180
I think the potion should take
care of a human girl in one shot.

251
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,650
"Potion?"

252
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,450
Have you forgotten?
The miracle love potion...

253
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,120
...that's been in our
family for generations.

254
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,400
The miracle love potion...
The Sigh of Isolde.

255
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,370
That might work...
Thanks, Mom!

256
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,490
Good luck.

257
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,080
Just you wait...
With the Sigh of Isolde...

258
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,170
...I'll mess up all
your plans for him.

259
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,090
- No... Stop it!
- Oh, you like it.

260
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,990
I didn't come
here for this!

261
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,430
I know.
But is it so bad?

262
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,200
No...
Don't do that...!

263
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,930
You're good at this.

264
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,670
Pretty crappy roost
you've got here.

265
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,640
Eganko!

266
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,110
Wha-?! Who is she?!
What's going on here?

267
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,150
Uh... Well...

268
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,480
- I'm history, pal!
- No, please...!

269
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,650
Christ...
Serves me right!

270
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,710
Wait, come back!

271
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,260
Considering how you've come all
the way to the human world...

272
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,360
...I'd think you'd get
something better than this!

273
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,490
Not in the budget. Rent's
outrageous around here!

274
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,770
Liar. You just need a place
for your little diversions.

275
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,520
So, did you manage to talk
Kingan into going back?

276
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,040
The prince just
won't listen to me.

277
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,520
He likes being that
cute girl's slave.

278
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,390
There she goes again!

279
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,420
That little bitch is nothing but
trouble for ANYONE from hell!

280
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,030
Hey, Mephisto.
Why don't you help me out?

281
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,930
Huh?

282
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,170
If my plan works,
Kingan'll go home with you.

283
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,870
Well, in that case...

284
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,210
I know it's short notice, but I
need to check the Hell-Net database.

285
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,270
Gotta find someone who's got
the hots for that "Midori" girl.

286
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,220
Won't accessing the
base get us in trouble?

287
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,620
Keep quiet about
it and who'll know?

288
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,090
Norio Yukimoto, huh?

289
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,570
I'm bored... Lemme out!

290
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,680
I thought lookin'
in her panties was okay!

291
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,290
Professor...
Have you kept your promise?

292
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,730
Midori...

293
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,470
Why won't you acknowledge me?
My heart is drawn to you.

294
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:01,340
This horny sow is
only a substitute for you.

295
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,990
Professor,
I'm about to release.

296
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,500
No! Not inside!

297
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,470
Then don't move
your body so much.

298
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm just... No...

299
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,470
Oh, yes!

300
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,750
Who are you? How'd you
get in here without a key?!

301
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,160
Oh please.
That's no trick at all.

302
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,220
So, you want
Midori Asai for yourself.

303
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,630
You want Midori Asai,
I want Norikazu Hanyu.

304
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:08,370
Norikazu's in your way,
and Midori's in my way.

305
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,470
You take her,
and I'll take Norikazu.

306
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,540
Like that'd work?

307
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,490
If we use this.

308
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,460
The miracle love potion:
The Sigh of Isolde.

309
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,650
"Sigh of Isolde?"

310
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,490
What are you...?

311
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,270
I just need a
little of your sperm.

312
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,230
Stop it!

313
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,250
Stop it, please!

314
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,680
No...

315
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,100
You're a naughty
little girl, aren't you?

316
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,690
Now, as an example,
we take this equation...

317
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,560
...in which we'll solve for
the variables x, y, and z.

318
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:36,900
We pay attention to the second
equation: x + 3y - 3z = 6.

319
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,990
We're going to leave the
x on the left side of...

320
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,730
...of the problem
while moving 3y and 3z...

321
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:56,490
You sure this
is going to work?

322
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,620
The blue one
is Norikazu's...

323
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,250
The red is the love potion
with your sperm added.

324
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,660
You're about
to see its effect.

325
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:08,990
Midori!

326
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,330
Professor!

327
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,570
Now watch. We rubbed that woman
of yours all over with the stuff.

328
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,020
Are you okay, Professor?

329
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,680
Who did this
horrible thing to you?!

330
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,660
Hanyu...
I can't take it anymore...

331
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,430
Please...
Squeeze my breasts...

332
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,160
But...?!

333
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,830
I... I don't know
what's wrong with me...

334
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,930
Please.
I can't take it anymore...

335
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,370
Hanyu, please...
Please, hurry!

336
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,380
Harder...
Hanyu, harder!

337
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,450
Yes! More! Harder!

338
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,390
Harder! Harder!

339
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,740
Hanyu, come into me.

340
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,020
- "Into you?!"
- Please.

341
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,610
B- but...!

342
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,520
This is a teacher's order!

343
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,750
Right...

344
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,720
Hurry!

345
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,260
Professor,
I'm putting it in.

346
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,430
Oh, yes!

347
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,050
Ow! What're you doing?!
What's your problem?!

348
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,780
Inside.

349
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,280
What are you doing?!

350
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,630
See? That's what your
boyfriend's REALLY like.

351
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,460
Someone who'd
do his own teacher.

352
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,740
Now it's your turn.

353
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,640
'Scuse me, Miss.

354
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,210
Stop it!
What are you doing?!

355
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,800
No! Stop it!

356
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,150
No! Stop-!

357
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,810
Don't...

358
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,820
Oh, YES!

359
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,510
Good luck.

360
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,070
Midori...

361
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,840
Don't!

362
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,850
Midori...

363
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,110
No!

364
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,820
Midori, be true
to your feelings!

365
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,380
See? This part of
you already is.

366
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,120
I can't...

367
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,790
Midori, I love you!

368
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,060
Yukimoto, stop it!

369
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,870
That's funny. Any woman who
gets covered with the potion...

370
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,600
...should be drawn to the
man the sperm came from and...

371
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,910
...fall hopelessly
in love with him.

372
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,410
What?

373
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,580
I mixed up the
red and the blue.

374
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,180
You moron!

375
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,480
No! Stop it!

376
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,890
Midori...!

377
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,160
My body...
It feels so hot...

378
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:04,400
No... No!
I'm in love... with Norikazu!

379
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,560
Stop it!

380
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,770
What...
What the hell's with you?!

381
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,830
You think I'm not
good enough for you?!

382
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,440
Don't make me laugh!

383
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,440
You think any of
you are my equal?!

384
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,950
Compared to an elite like me,
you're all just insects!

385
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,960
You incompetents should fall down
on your knees in front of me!

386
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,290
No, stop it!

387
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,450
Save me!

388
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,330
Norikazu, save me!

389
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,590
Midori!

390
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,900
Norio, stop it!

391
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,570
Midori, don't
you really want this?

392
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,210
Hanyu?!

393
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,940
You son of a...!

394
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,950
So, we're "insects", huh?

395
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,300
He's getting away!
After him!

396
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,620
Midori...

397
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,360
Norikazu...
You saved me.

398
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,870
Midori, I-

399
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,430
It's okay.

400
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,870
Midori...

401
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,310
Norikazu...

402
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,700
Oh? I don't see
the prince with you.

403
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,070
Well, I...

404
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,670
You poor SOB.
I guess this is Doomsday for you.

405
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,140
So... He's coming, is he?

406
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:41,670
Sharpening his claws right now.
Wonder who's the unlucky victim?

407
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,120
He'll be there soon.

408
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,890
I'll be going to
Midori's house after this.

409
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,160
And after I get what I want,
we'll both die together!

410
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,600
Well, uh,
good for you...

411
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,430
But before that, I'm going to
beat the living shit out of...

412
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,100
...you and
that vampire chick!

413
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,140
Whoa!

414
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,410
Incoming transmission!

415
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,380
Shut up,
you fucking machine!

416
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,380
No!
He's coming in from hell...!

417
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:19,390
5... 4...
3... 2... 1...

418
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,650
The hell with this thing!

419
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,650
Now what's going to happen?
