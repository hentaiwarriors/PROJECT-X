VISIONARY VOLUME 2 (BY U-JIN)
COLLEGE WOMEN ARE VERY SEXY

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,551
- Here you go, Miki.
- Thank you.

3
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:16,661
Are you definitely going
home through Katase Park?

4
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:19,666
l'll miss the start of my
favorite TV show if l don't.

5
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:22,528
You shouldn't go that way, Shiori.

6
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:26,300
Night time is when the human
mosquitoes come out to bite.

7
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:30,739
Mosquitos? What do you mean?

8
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:34,176
My friend said that at night in that
park,

9
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:39,586
only college girls are being
attacked by strange guys.

10
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:42,657
Att-Attacked? You mean gang-raped?

11
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:45,760
Oh! Sorry, you actually
don't need to worry, Shiori.

12
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:47,193
l don't need to worry?

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,126
l heard they only go after cute women.

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,234
<i>What? Are you trying to say l'm ugly?</i>

15
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:59,002
You're right. l'll be fine.

16
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:01,202
Yeah. But be careful anyway.

17
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:04,578
- Shiori.
- What, Miki?

18
00:01:04,613 --> 00:01:08,811
You'll definitely be fine.
You should go home through the park.

19
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:11,285
<i>Enough already, you!</i>

20
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:15,777
SKYDIVING IN LOVE

21
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:27,562
Ju-just a crow. That scared me.

22
00:01:32,908 --> 00:01:34,899
l'd better hurry.

23
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:37,802
<i>But if l see a human mosquito...</i>

24
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,249
<i>l wonder if l'd be surrounded.</i>

25
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:46,186
<i>They might make me do this.</i>

26
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:48,287
<i>Or this.</i>

27
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:50,185
l'm scared!

28
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,162
They're here!

29
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:00,725
<i>He's going to do this.</i>

30
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:07,967
Help!

31
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:17,481
l found a real pretty one tonight!

32
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,053
l'm getting dizzy!

33
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:28,386
Help!

34
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,630
Uh oh!

35
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,759
<i>ls this what she meant
about getting attacked?</i>

36
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,061
Let's go five more times.

37
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:38,596
Leave her alone!

38
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,234
Are you okay?

39
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:50,216
Yes, thanks. He just kept
spinning me around.

40
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:54,015
That's good. lt's dangerous to walk
alone in the park at night.

41
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:58,694
Here.

42
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:00,184
Thank you.

43
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,861
My name is Shiori Hanamura.

44
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,864
l'm Tadashi Okamura.

45
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:10,197
<i>So cute!
She's as pretty as an angel.</i>

46
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:17,870
lt was really a dangerous situation.

47
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:23,211
She was as pretty as an angel.
Almost not human.

48
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:27,189
Koban, l think you fell in love at
first sight. Am l right?

49
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:28,591
A-are you kidding?

50
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:30,559
lt's nothing to be ashamed of.

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,292
So, did you at least get her number?

52
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:33,852
No.

53
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:38,563
You fool. First you ask her number,
then you go for it.

54
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:42,297
l'm just not as smooth
as you are, Sameo.

55
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,934
Another call from a young lady.

56
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:48,901
Koban, let me borrow some cash.

57
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:50,740
That's all l have.

58
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:51,938
Perfect, perfect.

59
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:56,352
Why don't you come out with us?
l'll show you how it's done.

60
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:59,048
This is the day my tutor comes over.

61
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:06,150
Oh, the sexy college student?
You should make her your first.

62
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:07,355
Don't be stupid.

63
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:10,193
Look at you turning red. Later.

64
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:18,806
Translate all that into
English by next time.

65
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:19,568
Okay.

66
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:24,876
Tadashi, you found a girlfriend,
didn't you?

67
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:32,854
Your concentration is
not very good tonight.

68
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:37,954
Did l guess right?
Have you kissed her yet?

69
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:39,787
Are you kidding?

70
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:44,324
Well, then, l'll...
teach you how to kiss.

71
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,323
You can't do that!

72
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,160
Oh, s-sorry.

73
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:53,174
lt's okay, Tadashi.
Your naivety is endearing.

74
00:04:57,578 --> 00:05:01,428
{\an7}KATASE PARK

75
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:09,355
There's no way l'll see her.

76
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,301
<i>Shiori.</i>

77
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:25,196
<i>She's got a boyfriend.</i>

78
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:31,275
lt's good that you went all the way to
the park just to try to see her...

79
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:34,213
Too bad you had to see she wasn't alone.

80
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,682
Yeah.

81
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:39,088
l bet those two are sleeping together.

82
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:39,884
No way.

83
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:42,150
Don't romanticize women.

84
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,551
She's doing it with
that guy every night.

85
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:52,158
Shiori is not that type of woman.

86
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:55,159
Women get what they want. Grow up!

87
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:56,136
What!

88
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:57,402
Hold it.

89
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:00,675
Which one is calling me now?

90
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:01,698
Let me borrow some money.

91
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:05,269
Only if you take back
what you just said.

92
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:08,075
Sorry, sorry. l take it back.

93
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:22,362
Hello, Hanamura residence.

94
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:26,668
Oh, Ken? Now? l just took a shower
and l'm reading a book.

95
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:29,535
Hey, you want to take a
drive down to the shore now?

96
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:31,732
Okay. l'll get ready and wait for you.

97
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:34,373
l love you too. See you soon.

98
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:42,540
<i>Don't romanticize women.</i>

99
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,034
Morning, Shiori.

100
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:01,002
Morning, Miki.

101
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,028
Late night with Ken?

102
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:04,163
Well, yeah.

103
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:10,106
Oh, Shiori. l figured you were okay so
l didn't ask till now...

104
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,811
About what?

105
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,539
You know. The mosquitos.

106
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,709
Did you see any?

107
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:20,983
<i>l got attacked, so that means
l'm pretty...</i>

108
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:24,153
<i>But instead of being raped,
l just got spun around.</i>

109
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,923
<i>lt sounds so stupid l can't tell her.</i>

110
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:32,980
TEN DAYS LATER

111
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,436
Why'd you suddenly decide
you wanted to see the ocean?

112
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:42,842
No particular reason.

113
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:44,572
We should have invited Sameo too.

114
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:46,671
He's too busy with his women.

115
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:49,383
ln summer the shore is filled
with people,

116
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:52,785
But in the fall it's kind of sad
with no one around.

117
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:54,649
There's someone.

118
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,057
She probably got together with some guy
here this summer...

119
00:07:58,126 --> 00:08:01,493
broke up in the fall,
and came here feeling nostalgic.

120
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,464
Couldn't be.

121
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:06,201
No mistaking it. lf we act nice
to her she's all ours.

122
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,226
- Cut it out.
- lt'll be fine.

123
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:10,104
Let's go.

124
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:21,472
Are you alone?

125
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:24,680
Shiori!

126
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:26,677
Tadashi!

127
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:38,689
Figures it's someone he knows. Geez.

128
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:40,759
You came here alone?

129
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:44,402
Actually, ten days ago
my boyfriend died.

130
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,669
He was speeding and
the cops started chasing him.

131
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:51,480
He ran into the guardrail.

132
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,469
Really?

133
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:57,609
l met him here this summer.
l came back to forget about it.

134
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,542
GOODBYE

135
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:05,322
lt seems like he was ideal for you.

136
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,658
Can you really forget him that easily?

137
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:10,493
l don't have any particular
ideal for a guy.

138
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:13,695
The guy l fall for becomes my ideal.

139
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:23,942
lf l keep focusing on him
l'll never get anywhere.

140
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:26,274
You're only young once, right?

141
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,615
Tadashi.

142
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:32,280
You have someone you love, right?

143
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,483
Uh, well...no...

144
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:45,793
Why didn't you tell her the truth then?

145
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:48,129
How could l say that when
she's grieving about her dead lover.

146
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,137
Don't be stupid.

147
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,299
This woman can forget her lover
after ten days. She's no angel.

148
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:54,101
She's a practical woman.

149
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:57,134
Shiori is completely different
from the women you date.

150
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,943
What's different?
She's forgotten her dead lover, right?

151
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:03,645
She's already looking for a new guy.

152
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:06,919
l think she she said that while
still in shock from his death.

153
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,316
You're a romantic fool.

154
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,960
Yeah, and you change women
like you change your clothes.

155
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,860
Always going right from one to another.

156
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:17,422
You've got to be nice
and value them more.

157
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,833
l feel sorry for women who fall for you.

158
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:23,798
Hey, they always come looking for it.

159
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:26,471
Yeah, that's right.
You get all the chicks...

160
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:28,533
and l sit on the side
waiting for your leftovers.

161
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,639
Well, those leftovers...

162
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,441
l'm coming, l'm coming.

163
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,751
<i>l can't get it in if
it's not stiff, damn it.</i>

164
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:50,858
Why are you stopping in the middle?
Hey, who are you?

165
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:56,505
You say it doesn't work if
you have no affection for them...

166
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:57,563
You talk about love...

167
00:10:57,606 --> 00:10:59,597
but when it comes down to it
you're just a coward.

168
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:02,277
Well, if you didn't have my money...

169
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:06,354
you wouldn't even be able to
get one date, you... bum!

170
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,446
lf you don't like it, then...

171
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,616
One day...one day...l'll...

172
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:27,565
Hold it!

173
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:33,966
5-6-4-3... Another beautiful
woman needs me. Later.

174
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,471
Hey, don't you need money?

175
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:39,604
She's footing the bill today.

176
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:52,020
Shiori doesn't seem depressed
at all about Ken dying.

177
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,891
l know! She must have
already found a new guy.

178
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:57,430
This time it's probably a foreigner.

179
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,902
She's working at a cafe
to earn money for a trip abroad.

180
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,936
lf she doesn't get attacked
by the perverts in the park...

181
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,802
she's got no chance with foreigners.

182
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,947
- Yes? Who is it?
- Tadashi Okamura.

183
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:18,316
Just a second.

184
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:20,848
Come on in.

185
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:29,627
These are from my mother.
They are a birthday present.

186
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,461
Thank you! Come in.

187
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,558
- But...
- lt's okay.

188
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,296
Are you sure?

189
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:40,305
- You'll have a little, right?
- Sure.

190
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,717
That's my boyfriend.

191
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:51,909
We broke up today.

192
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,647
Broke up!

193
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:55,723
l feel much better now.

194
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,929
Rain? l'm glad my date is over.

195
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:06,328
l'll hang out here for a while.

196
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:07,966
May l help you?

197
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:29,724
Excuse me, do you have a match?

198
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:30,554
Yes.

199
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,258
Here you are.

200
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:34,760
<i>She's pretty.</i>

201
00:13:35,177 --> 00:13:36,268
Thanks.

202
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:42,370
l-l'm sorry.

203
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,338
That customer behind me
touched me and l jumped...

204
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:46,798
lt's okay. l'm fine.

205
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:52,808
Boy, it's really coming down.

206
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:56,249
Excuse me!
Please take this.

207
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:57,182
Oh, thanks.

208
00:13:57,252 --> 00:14:00,779
Um, l get off in about thirty minutes.

209
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:03,120
Can l buy you dinner
to apologize for that?

210
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:04,920
Sounds great.
l was just getting hungry.

211
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,229
Wait for me at the cafe
on the next corner.

212
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:09,197
- Okay.
- Bye.

213
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:11,631
Just dinner, or should we have more?

214
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:16,538
Why did you break up?

215
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:18,472
He was treating me like a doll.

216
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,998
A doll?

217
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,942
Yeah. We dated for five months...

218
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:25,947
but he didn't even hold
my hand or kiss me.

219
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:28,006
He'd hold my hand if l were a child.

220
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:30,949
lt sounds like he really
cares about you.

221
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:32,881
What do you mean, cares about me?

222
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:37,984
l wanted to be treated like
a human being, not like a doll.

223
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:40,954
l think he loves you.

224
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:43,829
lf he loves me then he
would satisfy my needs.

225
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,294
Maybe l'm just not attractive.

226
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:52,335
l think you're beautiful!

227
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,439
This is probably out of your
range of experience, Tadashi.

228
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:58,077
Are you still a virgin?

229
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,979
What...well, yes.

230
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:03,907
Then today l'll teach you something new.

231
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:17,493
lt will help me to forget him too.
Please, Tadashi.

232
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:22,600
Sayoko, please cut it out.

233
00:15:58,306 --> 00:16:00,797
Come on, Tadashi...

234
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,917
Shiori...

235
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:33,901
Sayoko...l'm sorry.
l love somebody else.

236
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:35,500
Goodbye.

237
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:37,272
Tadashi, you coward.

238
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,440
Hmm, so that's why you're working there?

239
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:44,979
l'd like to go to Europe
next summer with my friends.

240
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,750
But you know, that uniform
completely shows your ass.

241
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,126
That's why the salary is high.

242
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:53,651
Besides, it doesn't matter
to me if you can see it or not.

243
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:55,887
A pretty woman like you
shouldn't talk like that.

244
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,558
By the way, we haven't
introduced ourselves yet.

245
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,598
My name's Toru Yabe.

246
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:03,069
l'm Shiori Hanamura.
Nice to meet you.

247
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:04,929
<i>Shiori Hanamura...</i>

248
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:09,099
Her name's Shiori Hanamura.
Her uniform is from Hakuran college.

249
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,239
<i>So this is Koban's angel.
What a coincidence.</i>

250
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:14,907
- What's wrong?
- Oh... nothing, nothing.

251
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,980
Hey, do you want to go
to a disco after dinner?

252
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,843
Sounds good.

253
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:22,413
<i>lt's too bad, but l can't fool
around with Koban's angel.</i>

254
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:24,584
<i>lf he found out it would mean
the end of my handouts from him.</i>

255
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,817
Shiori.

256
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:27,891
Yeah?

257
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:31,264
l just realized when
l heard your name...

258
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,568
One of my buddies is
head over heals for you.

259
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:36,098
For me?

260
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:38,933
Yeah, it's definitely you.

261
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:42,238
He thinks that you are an angel.

262
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:43,938
An angel?

263
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,048
That's right. An angel,
not a normal human being.

264
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:49,312
Me?! That's so silly!

265
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:54,045
l know. He's got his own weird
romanticized image of you.

266
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:58,455
You're kidding! Me, l'm just a silly
little regular person.

267
00:17:59,227 --> 00:18:01,889
<i>l'd better open Koban's
eyes to women soon.</i>

268
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:09,626
lt will help me to forget him too.
Please, Tadashi.

269
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:12,533
<i>ls that the way women really feel?</i>

270
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,565
<i>Shiori must be different.</i>

271
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:16,700
Help me to forget...

272
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:19,645
Help me to forget...

273
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,512
Shiori is different!

274
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,443
Let's forget about the disco today...

275
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:28,488
but will you meet me
on Sunday afternoon?

276
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,020
Okay!

277
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:33,356
How about taking a spin
over Tokyo in a Cessna?

278
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:35,159
Cool!

279
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,259
<i>Ah, it's such a waste
to give her to Koban!</i>

280
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:49,844
Here you go. The million
and a half yen l promised you.

281
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:50,640
Good.

282
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:54,208
That's a pretty big amount,
even for me.

283
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:56,844
What did you mean about
it being for my benefit?

284
00:18:57,218 --> 00:19:01,154
Next Sunday l thought we'd
go skydiving. lt's been a while.

285
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:03,453
- Skydiving!
- That's right.

286
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:05,318
This is for last time.

287
00:19:14,202 --> 00:19:17,069
l went with the choppers because
no Cessnas were available.

288
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:20,074
lt cost 30,000 yen extra,
but you can pay later.

289
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:21,974
lf that was the case you
could have just used one.

290
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,571
l've got a reason for two.

291
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:27,581
l'm scared, Toru.
This is my first time skydiving.

292
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,913
Just do as l explained
and you'll be fine.

293
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:32,181
Both my friend and l will be there.

294
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,445
Koban, jump as soon as l signal you.

295
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:35,285
Roger.

296
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:40,759
- Jump, Koban.
- Okay.

297
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,460
Help!

298
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:52,329
That voice is...

299
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,335
Shiori!

300
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:56,108
What are you doing here?

301
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:58,577
l'm scared!

302
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:03,585
Sh-Shiori just wet her pants.
ls this a dream?

303
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,576
lt's no dream, Koban.

304
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:07,917
This was all your idea!

305
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:12,623
You see, right? Shiori is no angel.
She's a human being.

306
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,627
You have a minute before
the parachutes automatically open.

307
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:19,292
Confess your love for her.
Show her what you're made of!

308
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:32,745
Shiori, hold on!

309
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,710
Ta-Tadashi. lt's scary!

310
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:38,186
Don't worry. The parachute
will open automatically soon...

311
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:40,088
and l'm here next to you.

312
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:41,487
Please...stay next to me.

313
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:44,648
Okay. Shiori, l haven't been
able to forget you since...

314
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:47,354
that time in Katase Park.
l really fell for you.

315
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:52,259
Are you the one who thought
that l was an angel?

316
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,593
Yeah. But not anymore.
l know you're not an angel, or a doll.

317
00:20:56,671 --> 00:21:01,870
l'll show you the extent of my kindness,
Shiori. l love you.

318
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,104
Extent of your kindness... Tadashi.

319
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:07,477
Shiori. l love you!

320
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:11,348
Tadashi...you are my ideal guy.

321
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:14,149
The guy l fall for becomes my ideal.

322
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:16,050
Thank you, Shiori.

323
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:19,125
- Don't let me go.
- Okay.

324
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,622
Tadashi, we can't do that here.

325
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:30,795
Stop, Tadashi, not here...
we can do it anywhere else.

326
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:37,311
Here we go!

327
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:42,244
No time, no time.

328
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:50,557
This is fantastic!

329
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:57,723
l'm doing it with Shiori!
l'm the happiest guy alive!

330
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:00,190
Keep it up, pal!

331
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:08,443
l want to be inside Shiori till the end.

332
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:09,933
Tadashi...

333
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:16,615
Shiori!

334
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:18,942
Tadashi!

335
00:22:19,387 --> 00:22:21,378
My parachute isn't opening!

336
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:30,631
God, that was scary...
Hey Koban, friends are the best, huh?

337
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:32,758
Keep the monetary support coming!

338
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:43,803
Sameo, hurry up and
put that little thing away.

339
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:47,345
What the hell do you mean?
How about a little more gratitude!

340
00:22:51,113 --> 00:23:01,207
VISIONARY 2
STAY TUNED FOR THE NEXT STORY

341
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:21,004
Leave it to me. lt will be fine.

342
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:22,015
All right.

343
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:37,236
1ST ANNUAL NEW CENTURY QUEEN CONTEST

344
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:42,024
NEW CENTURY QUEEN

345
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:44,593
1ST ANNUAL NEW CENTURY QUEEN CONTEST

346
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:55,016
Really?!

347
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,786
l'm serious. He's a director
for Toyo Broadcasting and...

348
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:01,619
he says that he'll put
me in his next program.

349
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:03,816
Wow...l'm so jealous.

350
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:08,455
So would you like the signature
of a soon-to-be big star?

351
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:10,896
lt's a little early for that!

352
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:15,993
But where did you meet a TV director?

353
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:21,807
Well yesterday l stopped by
Shibuya on my way home...

354
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:27,478
<i>Wow...that's nice.</i>

355
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:39,824
<i>He's just my type!</i>

356
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:28,636
Come over here and touch me.

357
00:25:29,377 --> 00:25:31,368
l-is this a dream?

358
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,115
You can play with me,
as long as l keep my panties on.

359
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:58,935
l can't take it anymore!

360
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,931
- No!
- Wh-what do you mean, ''no''?

361
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:03,841
- No!
- H-hold it!

362
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:08,707
You can't leave me in agony like this.

363
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,283
But... l just met you and
don't know anything about you...

364
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,784
l'm a director for Toyo Broadcasting.

365
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:18,983
- Really?
- Yeah.

366
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:22,325
Here.

367
00:26:23,464 --> 00:26:25,455
What should l do?

368
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:30,263
O-okay, this is the deal.
l'll put you on my new program.

369
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:34,672
Of course l can't give
you a big role, but...

370
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:37,605
So... it's okay, right?

371
00:26:37,745 --> 00:26:38,871
Okay.

372
00:26:53,661 --> 00:26:56,425
Here, this is his business card.

373
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:57,761
Wow!

374
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:01,824
Maybe you'll meet a star
if you go over to the TV station!

375
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:06,338
lf l see anyone l'll bring
you back a signature.

376
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:11,435
Oh, l've got to go.
l'm meeting him again.

377
00:27:11,612 --> 00:27:12,772
Hey, wait up Shizue.

378
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,772
l'm... l'm so jealous!

379
00:27:16,817 --> 00:27:19,445
Will you really bring
back a signature for me?

380
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:24,022
What is this?

381
00:27:24,158 --> 00:27:26,524
1st Annual
New Century Queen Contest

382
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:30,089
This is my chance!

383
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,807
How about it, Reiko?
Will you appear in it for me?

384
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:47,078
Okay, okay! Deeper!

385
00:28:19,847 --> 00:28:21,838
You're leaving already?

386
00:28:21,882 --> 00:28:25,613
Yeah, l have a meeting
first thing in the morning.

387
00:28:25,786 --> 00:28:27,219
Look forward to seeing you soon.

388
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:31,921
He's the best!

389
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:38,933
According to the data from our agency,
8 out of 10 respondents...

390
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:41,527
are convinced they can become stars.
NEW CENTURY QUEEN AUDITION OFFICE

391
00:28:41,528 --> 00:28:42,635
NEW CENTURY QUEEN AUDITION OFFICE

392
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:49,375
l guess that's why we get
such ugly ones responding too.

393
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:51,411
Don't make me laugh.

394
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:28,749
Akagi.

395
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,139
PLEASE CHOOSE ME, MAI INOUE!

396
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:08,647
{\an}BEST

397
00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:32,776
Reiko Hanamura gave us
an okay through her office.

398
00:29:33,654 --> 00:29:35,856
With this the ratings for
Toyo's station opening...

399
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:38,450
commemorative drama ought to go up.

400
00:29:38,492 --> 00:29:40,960
We couldn't do it without you.

401
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:45,022
Every actress you get into your bed
is putty in your hands.

402
00:29:45,499 --> 00:29:46,830
l appreciate the compliment, but...

403
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:50,764
Of course if you didn't
have that skill we'd either...

404
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:53,005
fire you or send you off to a little
subsidiary somewhere.

405
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,309
Wait, who is it who relies
so much on that skill, Mr. Ando?

406
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:00,470
What'd you say?!

407
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:03,642
ls that the way you talk to your
production manager?!

408
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,810
lt's started again...

409
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:09,115
Geez, it's whenever those two
get near each other.

410
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:14,249
l wish they'd hurry up and finish.
l want to go home.

411
00:30:14,495 --> 00:30:17,464
l'm busy now.
Would you please get out of here?

412
00:30:17,464 --> 00:30:21,332
What?! This is the last time
l have you do anything.

413
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:24,502
Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.

414
00:30:24,672 --> 00:30:27,334
l've been hearing bad
rumors about you...

415
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:30,003
Remember this, Akagi. One day...

416
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:33,013
l'm going to expose everything
and you'll be history.

417
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:35,506
And l'll do the same for you!

418
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:47,456
l chose one from the first survey...

419
00:30:48,128 --> 00:30:51,791
Kumi Kobayashi.
She's perfect.

420
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:57,700
Yes, it will be fine. Please trust me.
Okay...

421
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:10,257
NEW CENTURY QUEEN 2ND ROUND AUDITIONS

422
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:15,152
That's all for the questions.
Good work today.

423
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:20,086
We will send the results to the
addresses you've given us.

424
00:31:20,494 --> 00:31:22,985
Thank you very much.

425
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:37,000
All right, l will ask
the first question.

426
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:41,675
Number 18, Harumi Yokota.

427
00:31:41,715 --> 00:31:42,682
Yes.

428
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,584
What do you want to become in the
future?

429
00:31:47,054 --> 00:31:52,617
An actress. l'd like to become an
actress like Jody Foster.

430
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:56,318
What is it about Jody Foster that
appeals to you?

431
00:31:56,597 --> 00:31:59,088
She is intelligent and is
very expressive.

432
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,791
She really makes her presence felt.

433
00:32:02,136 --> 00:32:06,630
<i>Kenichi Kurahashi...
he must be Shizue's new boyfriend...</i>

434
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,471
Mai! Mai lnoue!

435
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,477
Y-yes!

436
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:13,736
Who do you aim to be like?

437
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:18,482
The singer Seiko Matsuda.
l'm moved by her ability to do her...

438
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,920
own thing without being swayed
by the world around her...

439
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:28,395
Okay, Number 15, Hitomi Nakaoku.

440
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:29,293
Yes.

441
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:32,389
Which is your favorite among the
products my company puts out?

442
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:36,868
l really like the chocolate marmalade.

443
00:32:37,504 --> 00:32:40,496
l don't know who the sponsor
is going to choose...

444
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:44,044
but in the end we're the ones
who tally the votes...

445
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:47,309
Yeah, let's ignore their opinion.

446
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:50,440
lf that's the case,
we've got these three.

447
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:58,416
But what do you do if they can't sing?

448
00:32:59,026 --> 00:33:02,621
Stars nowadays don't
have to be able to sing.

449
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,368
Hmm, it's changed, hasn't it?
Until recently someone who...

450
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:09,768
wanted to become a star
came from a one-parent family...

451
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,737
Or was the daughter a wealthy family.

452
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:15,274
Now it's the exact opposite...

453
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:41,490
You were in today's audition,
weren't you?

454
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,499
Yes, l was!

455
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:52,067
l'm Mai lnoue. You remembered me?
l'm so happy!

456
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:55,114
This is no good, you coming here...

457
00:33:56,884 --> 00:33:59,751
Please go to bed with me...

458
00:34:15,502 --> 00:34:18,994
l don't know where you
heard anything like that, but...

459
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,342
Thinking if you sleep with
someone you'll make it...

460
00:34:22,342 --> 00:34:24,435
the entertainment world isn't so
screwed up.

461
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,011
lt's just not true.

462
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:43,353
lf that's the case,
then do it just for me.

463
00:34:43,497 --> 00:34:45,692
Hey, hey...this is no good.

464
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:53,304
Hmm...great curves.

465
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,472
B-but if you're still green...

466
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:08,311
Still green?
Oh, you mean a virgin, right?

467
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:12,989
lf that's it, do-n't wo-r-ry!

468
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:16,779
Yes, that's correct.
l'll choose an appropriate winner...

469
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:18,992
from the audition and
make a contract with Big Pro.

470
00:36:18,992 --> 00:36:23,664
<i>l'll contract with the one you
chose, Kumi Kobayashi, tomorrow.</i>

471
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:25,996
<i>With this our plan will be complete.</i>

472
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:28,335
<i>But don't let your guard
down 'till the end.</i>

473
00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:29,802
l understand.

474
00:36:35,008 --> 00:36:37,670
What was that, ''do-n't wo-r-ry''
business?

475
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:41,337
Well, virgins are nice once in a while.

476
00:37:08,642 --> 00:37:12,976
l feel that the best
of the three is Mai lnoue.

477
00:37:14,514 --> 00:37:15,981
Hmm, if you think so, then...

478
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:20,819
Yeah, Akagi is always right
when it comes to women.

479
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:22,984
lt's decided!

480
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,822
Okay, let's choose her
for the grand prize.

481
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,984
No objections!

482
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:35,969
Akagi!

483
00:37:36,169 --> 00:37:38,660
Oh, Mr. Suda...

484
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:43,299
The contract is all set, right?
Between my company, Big Pro...

485
00:37:43,443 --> 00:37:47,504
and the grand prize winner.

486
00:37:47,614 --> 00:37:50,777
l've deposited the five million
into your account.

487
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:56,746
Huh? The grand prize
has already been decided?

488
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:00,692
Shhh! Be quiet! Someone will hear you!

489
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:03,463
There will be some adjustment
in the actual voting

490
00:38:03,463 --> 00:38:05,931
when our well-known
academics cast their ballots...

491
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:09,970
But at this point, Mai is practically
guaranteed the win.

492
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:15,465
So therefore, if you would just sign
this temporary contract...

493
00:38:15,642 --> 00:38:19,442
Y-yes...but l have to
talk to my husband...

494
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:23,472
lt's okay, Mom. l'm all for it!

495
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:29,986
Tomorrow's ceremony
will be just for show.

496
00:38:30,023 --> 00:38:31,591
You'll hear for the first time...

497
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:34,961
that you are the grand prize winner.

498
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:39,193
And then you'll start crying
and shaking with joy. You got it?

499
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:42,690
You can do it.
This is life in the business.

500
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:44,060
Okay!

501
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,435
This is Akagi.
l've confirmed that...

502
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:55,539
l've confirmed that we received
the five million from Big Pro.

503
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:58,950
<i>Good. l've set up a
contract between ABC Pro</i>

504
00:38:58,985 --> 00:39:02,284
<i>and Kumi Kobayashi
and received the ten million.</i>

505
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:04,947
Everything has come together.

506
00:39:12,938 --> 00:39:18,057
NEW CENTURY QUEEN

507
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:38,449
Now, finally, we will announce
the grand prize winner!

508
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,865
NOTlCE OF RETlREMENT

509
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,103
Huh? Those enemies Akagi and Ando...

510
00:39:50,103 --> 00:39:53,004
both quit the company at the same time?

511
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,276
You haven't heard?
Those two...

512
00:39:56,276 --> 00:40:00,372
have formed their own production
company called 24 Office.

513
00:40:00,547 --> 00:40:02,777
No way! Those two?!

514
00:40:04,851 --> 00:40:09,015
l have just received the
results from our judges.

515
00:40:16,496 --> 00:40:21,024
The grand prize goes
to entry number... seven!

516
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,192
Mai lnoue!

517
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:26,028
Congratulations!

518
00:40:26,573 --> 00:40:30,134
<i>You'll hear for the first time
that you are the winner.</i>

519
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:32,937
<i>And then you'll start crying
and shaking with joy.</i>

520
00:40:33,046 --> 00:40:35,310
<i>You got it? You can do it.</i>

521
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:39,382
l...l can't believe it....

522
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:47,985
Congratulations, Mai.

523
00:40:48,261 --> 00:40:51,662
Who would you like to
share your happiness with?

524
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:58,568
M-my mother who worked
so hard raising me... Thank you.

525
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:05,000
Hmm, she's pretty good, isn't she?

526
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:11,641
With this, our plan
to go independent is complete.
