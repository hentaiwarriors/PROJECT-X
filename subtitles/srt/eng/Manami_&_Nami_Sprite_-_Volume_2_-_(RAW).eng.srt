1
00:00:32,644 --> 00:00:34,305
Hey, that's...

2
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:36,313
Oh, it's Manami's boyfriend.

3
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:42,179
Well, he's been making
passes at her, at any rate.

4
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:48,151
Huh? Masaya?

5
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:50,354
But...

6
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:53,022
is this really me?

7
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,461
If Toru can fool around
with Chiaki...

8
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,131
then I can have my fun, too!

9
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,416
Please, stop!

10
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:18,888
Who's making my body
move like this?

11
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:26,354
STOP!!!!

12
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:37,404
Manami and Nami
Sprite

13
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:40,704
I'm Toru Takamura.

14
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:42,440
I'm a college sophomore
and I have to stay...

15
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:44,943
with my relatives in Tokyo,
the Sakumotos.

16
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,313
By the way, the Sakumoto's
only daughter, Manami...

17
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,454
has a split personality!

18
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:54,982
All I know is that it only
happens when I call her, "Nami".

19
00:01:55,594 --> 00:01:58,495
And today she's disappeared
into town again.

20
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:03,799
I don't know what to
do with you!

21
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:06,734
You could've at least called
to say you'd be late...

22
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:09,171
because it rained,
or something!

23
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:11,175
You're not a child, after all!

24
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,439
I'm so embarrassed that you've
even got Toru covering for you!

25
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:17,146
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,626
Yes?

27
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:30,954
I'm really sorry about what
happened today, Toru.

28
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:33,497
Not at all. It was the least
I could do.

29
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:36,294
Manami's coming down with a
fever, so she's taken some medicine.

30
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:38,461
But could you tell me
if something happens?

31
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:40,164
Sure, no problem.

32
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:41,637
Thanks a lot.

33
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,912
I'll check her out right away!

34
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:58,148
Nami! Nami!

35
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:00,382
You awake?

36
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:03,185
What's all the racket?
What do you want?

37
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:04,694
What do you mean?

38
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:06,958
You worried me.

39
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:08,492
I wonder.

40
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:12,792
What were you doing
on such a rainy night?

41
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:16,238
And also, what did you mean
before by, "I'm disappearing"?

42
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:18,707
Actually...

43
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:33,987
Masaya asked me out
a while ago.

44
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:35,523
WHAAAT?

45
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:38,926
Toru, is something wrong?

46
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:41,355
No, sorry!

47
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:44,300
I, uh... just remembered
I've got some homework.

48
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,904
Oh, I'm sorry.

49
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:49,270
You've been so busy looking
after Manami today.

50
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:52,202
Would you like a late-night
snack?

51
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:55,405
No, I'm fine! It won't take
me long!

52
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,083
That scared me.

53
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:06,124
You're the one who scared me!

54
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,783
Look who's talking!

55
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,395
Yeah, well I went in, but
I left part way through.

56
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:48,330
N-No...

57
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:51,267
What's the matter, Manami?

58
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,731
Just be quiet.

59
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:57,771
Don't tell me you chickened out.

60
00:04:57,843 --> 00:05:00,710
Especially considering how into
it you were, up until now.

61
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:04,610
The timing's just wrong.

62
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,413
You shouldn't play around
with a man's heart like that.

63
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:09,781
Let go of me!

64
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:13,286
There's no point in fighting,
Manami!

65
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:15,019
I'm not Manami!

66
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:28,129
When I left, I suddenly heard
Manami's voice...

67
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:31,175
even though she's always
asleep when I'm awake.

68
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:35,012
Don't scare the crap
out of me!

69
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,445
I was positive that you'd...

70
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,645
Your imagination's
running wild, stupid.

71
00:05:43,722 --> 00:05:45,485
Don't go getting a stiffie.

72
00:05:46,558 --> 00:05:47,616
Owww!

73
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:51,825
So, Manami's your kind
of woman, huh?

74
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:54,761
Huh? What do you mean?

75
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:59,331
Now that I think of it, Manami
had a thing for you, too.

76
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:01,734
You're a lucky guy.

77
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:04,172
How could you do that?

78
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:07,672
That's your punishment for
fooling around with Chiaki.

79
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:10,010
You're wrong!

80
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:12,776
Chiaki just hates Manami.

81
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:15,149
That's the only reason she
made a pass at me.

82
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:19,813
If Manami wakes up while
I'm out...

83
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:24,287
I'll disappear, since I'm
not the main personality.

84
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:26,956
Would you cry for me,
if I disappeared?

85
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,361
Stop thinking such crazy things.

86
00:06:29,434 --> 00:06:30,867
I'd do something.

87
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:33,166
You'd be putting yourself out.

88
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:36,366
If I disappeared, you'd be able
to go steady with Manami.

89
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:40,934
But I like Manami AND you,
Nami!

90
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:42,478
Huh?

91
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:46,884
I'll try summoning Manami
and explaining it to her.

92
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:50,987
If I can find some way
that you won't disappear...

93
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:52,819
How would you summon her?

94
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:53,687
Well...

95
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:57,723
I've just gotta go back to the
point where Manami disappeared.

96
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:01,159
You mean you wanna do
something naughty?

97
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,889
D-Don't be ridiculous!

98
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,458
I'm serious, here!

99
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:06,432
I'll believe you!

100
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,318
I can't stop myself...

101
00:07:58,223 --> 00:07:59,247
Sorry!

102
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:01,952
Be gentle there.

103
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,947
How'd it go?

104
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:00,849
Perfect! I came!

105
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:04,178
That's not what I meant!

106
00:09:04,355 --> 00:09:07,188
I meant, did you manage
to contact Manami?

107
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,851
Not yet.

108
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:11,054
What now?

109
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:12,687
We can't go any further...

110
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:14,095
Don't you wanna do it?

111
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:16,565
What?
Are you sure?

112
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,499
Yeah, if it's with you.

113
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:23,700
Aha! At last, the day's come
when I'll lose my virginity!

114
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,640
If you don't mind using
my body, that is.

115
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:32,774
Thanks to you, I had
a great orgasm.

116
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:38,346
Now I'm gonna return
the favor.

117
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,224
HOOORAAAY!!!

118
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,527
H-Hang on a second!

119
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:50,391
Stop using my body like this!

120
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:51,967
Is that you, Manami?

121
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:58,700
Can you hear me?

122
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,937
Yeah, I can.

123
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:08,083
Please, just try to listen calmly.

124
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:11,717
I'm a second personality
that lives inside you.

125
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:13,117
Understand?

126
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:15,852
Yeah, I've kind of felt you
were there.

127
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:21,826
I want you to try and accept
the fact that I exist.

128
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,765
Don't make me disappear.

129
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:28,835
I've come to your rescue before,
when you were in trouble.

130
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:30,369
Do you remember?

131
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:31,999
Vaguely.

132
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:35,872
Just as I can't exist
without you...

133
00:10:36,414 --> 00:10:38,439
I think I'm vital to you.

134
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:41,711
Please try to understand.

135
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:45,386
But!

136
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:48,221
You won't go any further
with him?

137
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:50,887
Because... I'm uh...
still a virgin.

138
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:52,495
So am I!

139
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:55,959
And anyway, you like
Toru, right?

140
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:58,961
Yeah, I do...

141
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,833
But I'm not ready for
anything like that yet.

142
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:05,034
Right, but you didn't come
out when Toru touched me!

143
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,275
That's because you were
so determined!

144
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:12,382
Uh, any chance you contacted
Manami?

145
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,815
Man, you're a pain!

146
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:15,819
Just pipe down, would you?

147
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:16,979
Beg your pardon...

148
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:20,157
I'm just a big screw-up,
anyway.

149
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:28,196
Okay, I'll change places with you
right now.

150
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,996
But in exchange, make sure
you love Toru back.

151
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:32,291
What?

152
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:41,111
Admit it, you felt it just as
much as I did, right?

153
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:45,279
You have to do it back to him,
otherwise it's so one-sided.

154
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:47,842
I was so happy when
Toru said...

155
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,979
I'm a different personality
from you.

156
00:11:51,956 --> 00:11:56,416
But he says he cares for me
as much as you.

157
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:59,355
He said he likes me.

158
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:01,525
As much as you.

159
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:22,742
If it'll make Toru happy...

160
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:29,819
then I'm prepared to do
anything for him.

161
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:38,429
Hey, you!

162
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,596
How come you're sulking
in bed?

163
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:43,668
I'm crawling in!

164
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,070
I like you, Toru!

165
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,074
Let's keep fooling around!

166
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:49,241
Really?

167
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:53,410
But tonight, don't go putting
this thing inside Manami.

168
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:54,314
What?

169
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:56,683
Then we won't even
be fooling around!

170
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:59,587
But if you break my
you-know-what...

171
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:02,353
then poor Manami won't
be a virgin anymore.

172
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,022
Well, I guess I can't do it
unless she gives the thumbs up.

173
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:11,261
You don't know about it,
but she has given the okay!

174
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:13,963
But I'm upset, so I
won't tell you!

175
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:19,073
Man, your personality and
Manami's are like water and oil.

176
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:21,941
How did you end up coming out
of Manami in the first place?

177
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:24,038
No way!!
I don't believe it!

178
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:25,480
Are you being serious?

179
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:29,711
If you haven't figured it out,
then I'll tell you.

180
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:32,415
It was you that created me,
you know.

181
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,479
Huh?

182
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,518
Come on, what's that
supposed to mean?

183
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,351
Nami, I can't stop...

184
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:42,219
That's okay.

185
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:46,024
Just let it all flow into
my mouth.

186
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:57,170
There's so much...

187
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:58,799
It keeps on coming!

188
00:14:58,876 --> 00:14:59,843
Unreal!

189
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,716
Crap! How did I end up
causing all this?

190
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:17,360
My body feels better...

191
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:19,487
but things sure aren't
clear in my head.

192
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:21,826
Good morning, Toru.

193
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:24,728
Finish up your homework?

194
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:26,058
Homework?

195
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:27,729
Oh, I managed...

196
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:31,998
Breakfast won't be much
longer now.

197
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:33,566
Hey, where's Manami?

198
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:37,073
She left quite a while ago,
out for a walk.

199
00:16:00,905 --> 00:16:03,635
M-Manami?

200
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:05,871
Oh, Toru.

201
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:08,376
Can I sit with you?

202
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:09,777
Mm-hm.

203
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:36,967
Hey, um...

204
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:43,043
Did you hear about the other
person inside you?

205
00:16:43,814 --> 00:16:44,803
Yeah.

206
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:47,674
I think I'd already realized it.

207
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:50,186
So it wasn't a big surprise.

208
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:53,087
There were times when
my memory blacked out.

209
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:03,563
Sorry about last night.

210
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:05,864
I just had to summon you.

211
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:18,148
No, that's okay.

212
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:20,377
Don't worry about it.

213
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:24,152
Anyway, if you hadn't
summoned me, I...

214
00:17:24,722 --> 00:17:25,450
Manami...

215
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:30,292
Without my knowing it,
this other person inside me...

216
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:33,194
seems to be growing
stronger and stronger.

217
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:37,030
I mean, if I completely
disappeared altogether...

218
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:39,502
what would happen to me?

219
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:48,171
Um, I probably can't phrase
this very well...

220
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:51,581
But you have your own
good points.

221
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:55,976
Like your kindness, and your
deep sense of discretion.

222
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:57,884
So you'd never disappear.

223
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,622
Toru...

224
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,455
And the other personality
has its own good points, too.

225
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:11,794
But even though you
don't see it...

226
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:15,703
I think the charms of both
personalities are yours.

227
00:18:18,142 --> 00:18:21,043
I like both sides of you,
Manami.

228
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:30,852
So let's just calm down
and see how things pan out.

229
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:36,049
I'll keep my eye on things so
it doesn't get you in trouble.

230
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:38,817
Mm-hm.

231
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:53,006
I've gotta be careful not to
summon Nami for a while.

232
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,782
Hey, hey!

233
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:16,162
Here.

234
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,222
Thank you.

235
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:25,331
Thanks.

236
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:35,616
Manami and Nami
Sprite

237
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:44,024
Hey, Manami!

238
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:46,791
There's a big sale at Pario
today, wanna go?

239
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:50,526
No thanks, not today.

240
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:54,696
Gee, Manami didn't seem
very cheery today, did she?

241
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:58,905
No, but hasn't she always
been that way?

242
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:00,910
Yeah, I guess.

243
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:08,009
What in the world's gonna
happen to me?

244
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:20,425
Manami had made up
her mind to accept Nami...

245
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:24,261
but at college she became
more and more withdrawn.

246
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:28,633
Manami says she's not going
to college today.

247
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:31,470
Toru, did something happen
to her at college?

248
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:34,305
Well, I'm in the class
next door.

249
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:35,504
I wouldn't know.

250
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:37,547
Yeah, I suppose.

251
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:40,880
Can't tell her she's worried
about her double personality.

252
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:48,220
Sakumoto's become a real
babe lately, huh?

253
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,089
Yeah, she's gotten so bright!

254
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:52,391
She used to be so glum before!

255
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,288
I knew it!

256
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:59,530
My other personality, Nami,
is much more charming!

257
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:00,666
What?

258
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:02,899
Manami's taking today off, too?

259
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:03,905
Is it a cold?

260
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:06,670
Yeah, and it's a real bugger
to get over, too.

261
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:09,806
Oh, Sakumoto's taking
today off, as well?

262
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,711
That's the third day in a row.

263
00:21:16,754 --> 00:21:18,483
Man, this is a problem.

264
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:22,419
It was you that created me,
you know.

265
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,991
I created you?

266
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:26,427
But how?

267
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:29,158
Manami seems to have changed?

268
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,631
Well, I guess it happened around
the time Toru transferred here.

269
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:37,130
Hey, Toru!

270
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:39,434
My stomach's killing me!

271
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,375
Take me to the sick room.

272
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:43,936
Why don't you tell the person
in charge in your own class?

273
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:45,282
Hey!!

274
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:48,011
Are you trying to let a woman
die before your eyes?

275
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:49,848
Uh... ouch!

276
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:52,812
Hey, the nurse isn't here.

277
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:56,449
Oh, well.

278
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:58,524
Here's the stomach medicine.

279
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:01,895
I hear your dad's a doctor.

280
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,330
Yeah, that's right.

281
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:08,471
Then I bet when you were a kid,
you wanted to play doctor a lot.

282
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:10,137
Yeah, I guess.

283
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:17,905
In exchange for the medicine,
I'll play adult doctor with you.

284
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:20,742
Wait-what about your sore
stomach?

285
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:22,478
Forget about that!!

286
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:26,421
Owww!

287
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,958
Manami's not at college
today, right?

288
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:30,357
What're you doing?

289
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:32,317
Hey, hey!

290
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:35,293
I'll be the doctor, and
you be the patient!

291
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:36,956
Stop, you idiot!

292
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:39,730
Don't be embarrassed
around the doctor!

293
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:42,472
No, Toru!

294
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,167
I'm embarrassed!

295
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:47,105
Are you being serious?

296
00:22:47,177 --> 00:22:49,839
It was you that created me,
you know.

297
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:51,746
I don't believe it!

298
00:22:51,815 --> 00:22:54,147
It was you that created me.

299
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:55,276
Are you being serious?

300
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:56,114
It was you...

301
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:57,915
If you haven't figured it out...

302
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:00,388
It was you that created me.

303
00:23:03,994 --> 00:23:06,224
NOW I REMEMBER!!!

304
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:10,830
Let's play doctor and
also transformer!

305
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:12,193
Transformer?

306
00:23:12,469 --> 00:23:15,165
Manami, you become Nami,
a different person.

307
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:16,328
Nami?

308
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:21,276
Yeah, and Nami's really
strong, and she's never shy!

309
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:24,771
Okay, Nami.

310
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:26,873
Lie on your side, and pull
down your panties.

311
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:27,918
Uh-huh.

312
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,553
Toru! Let's play doctor!

313
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:34,246
Huh?

314
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:37,887
That's funny. It's not
like my Daddy's!

315
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:40,562
Ow, that hurts!!

316
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,828
You're acting weird today,
Manami!

317
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:46,793
What're you talking about?

318
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,304
When we're playing,
I'm Nami, not Manami!

319
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:51,074
You should know that!

320
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:55,310
I did that all the time since
I was a kid!!!

321
00:23:58,282 --> 00:24:00,273
Um, Toru?

322
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:04,451
Nami had been dormant
for over ten years...

323
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:06,716
but now she's come to
life again!

324
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:09,456
And she came out when she
heard me calling her!

325
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:10,959
Uh, are you okay?

326
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:14,760
Chiaki, I'm skipping classes,
so see you.

327
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,088
Huh?

328
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:19,635
Hey, wait a second...

329
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,537
What's with that Toru?

330
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:28,971
Well at least now I know
where Nami came from!

331
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,338
Manami I've figured it out!

332
00:24:31,415 --> 00:24:32,939
- I've got it.
- Huh?

333
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:37,051
Manami, do you remember
coming to my place in Sendai...

334
00:24:37,121 --> 00:24:40,181
and playing doctor with me,
when we were small?

335
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:42,122
No, not at all.

336
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,996
Oh, I guess Nami would
be the one who'd remember.

337
00:24:47,498 --> 00:24:51,457
Anyway, that's when Nami
was first created.

338
00:24:51,535 --> 00:24:54,504
So if we can go back to where
we left off in Sendai...

339
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:57,369
you'll return to your original
state, and Nami will...

340
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:01,937
Nami might disappear.

341
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:05,240
So let's go to Sendai!

342
00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:07,146
Let's not sit here thinking
about it. Let's just do it!

343
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:21,387
I wonder if her mom really
trusts me that much.

344
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:25,832
She had no problems with
the idea of going to Sendai.

345
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:31,441
Guess she's worried about Manami,
a top student, being so withdrawn.

346
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:39,112
I told Manami that Nami
would disappear.

347
00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:43,517
But actually, I hope neither
of you disappear, Nami.

348
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:12,472
I can vaguely remember the
roof and posts of this house...

349
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:13,516
But...

350
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:16,046
it seems familiar.

351
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:20,151
Oh, my!
You're all grown up!

352
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:22,452
Honey, it's Manami,
from Tokyo!

353
00:26:22,526 --> 00:26:24,585
This is a get-well gift
from my father.

354
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:25,525
Oh, my!

355
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:26,790
Thanks so much!

356
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:31,033
What are you saying, Mom?

357
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:32,193
Looks like me!

358
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:34,100
Not you, too, Manami!

359
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,574
Manami, your cooking
was delicious!

360
00:26:40,644 --> 00:26:41,736
Thanks very much!

361
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:43,575
Now you take care, dear!

362
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:46,343
Dad, I have a day off tomorrow.

363
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:48,077
So I'll take aunty back
on my way home.

364
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:49,414
Oh, okay.

365
00:26:49,553 --> 00:26:50,679
Good-night.

366
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:59,325
Aren't you cold, Manami?

367
00:26:59,396 --> 00:27:00,761
No, I'm fine.

368
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:08,699
Oh, right.

369
00:27:08,772 --> 00:27:11,400
Nami, the other personality
inside me...

370
00:27:11,475 --> 00:27:14,638
was born under these stars.

371
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:20,580
You're not tired yet,
are you, Manami?

372
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:22,414
Come over to my room.

373
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:23,953
Uh-huh.

374
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:31,119
Nami! Nami!

375
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:45,672
Nami?

376
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:47,572
Yeah.

377
00:27:48,312 --> 00:27:52,874
Nami, I'm about to try
and make you disappear.

378
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,918
But actually, I don't
want to do it.

379
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:57,078
I'm probably being
hypocritical...

380
00:27:57,154 --> 00:28:00,715
but could you try
and help out...

381
00:28:00,824 --> 00:28:04,521
so that you can both
return together?

382
00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:09,223
Sure, that's okay.

383
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,028
Just do as you like.

384
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:13,763
I'm turning back into
Manami now.

385
00:28:39,096 --> 00:28:40,461
Huh? I...

386
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:43,189
Oh, are you awake, Manami?

387
00:28:43,867 --> 00:28:47,359
Boy, I must've been tired.

388
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:49,462
I fell asleep at some point.

389
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:51,674
Here it is.

390
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:52,936
Remember this?

391
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:55,871
Your red stethoscope!

392
00:28:56,213 --> 00:28:59,376
Yeah, the old one my dad
gave me.

393
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:02,050
Remember playing doctor
with this?

394
00:29:03,754 --> 00:29:06,416
You're the one who used
a felt pen to color it red.

395
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:08,347
What? I did?

396
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,920
I remember this red color,
but...

397
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:18,000
It does seem like Nami has
the strongest memories.

398
00:29:18,235 --> 00:29:20,135
Which means, I guess...

399
00:29:21,305 --> 00:29:23,830
- Anyway, let's start.
- Start what?

400
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:27,541
What do you mean?
Playing doctor, of course!

401
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:31,037
Come off it, Toru!
You're kidding!

402
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:34,940
Manami! I'm not joking around!

403
00:29:35,385 --> 00:29:38,115
This is the way to cure
your split personality!

404
00:29:38,822 --> 00:29:41,791
When we played doctor as kids
Nami's personality was born...

405
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:44,588
so that you wouldn't
be embarrassed.

406
00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:47,525
So this time you've gotta
try it yourself.

407
00:29:47,597 --> 00:29:50,031
Then things will probably
turn out differently, right?

408
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,534
That was the whole point
of coming here!

409
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,431
Mm-hm.

410
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,108
Now that that's settled,
let's start!

411
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:03,606
Get real-what's with
that outfit?

412
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:07,283
This is more realistic, right?

413
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:15,186
You're hilarious, Toru!

414
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:18,421
Saying, "let's play doctor", and
looking so serious about it!

415
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:20,759
No, you can't call me Toru!

416
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:21,889
It's "doctor"!

417
00:30:21,965 --> 00:30:25,696
Do it just like when we
were kids, and be serious!

418
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:28,169
Otherwise, this whole thing
is pointless!

419
00:30:30,674 --> 00:30:32,471
Got it?

420
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:33,531
Yeah...

421
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,134
Well, uh, take off your top.

422
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:37,077
And your bra, too.

423
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:42,784
I think I'm gonna end up
with a split personality!!!

424
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:51,993
Doctor...

425
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:53,359
I've taken them off.

426
00:31:03,874 --> 00:31:05,671
Calm down... calm down...

427
00:31:06,276 --> 00:31:09,609
I've seen Nami like this
quite a few times.

428
00:31:09,846 --> 00:31:13,407
But to think that Manami
would show me her boobs!

429
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:15,815
It feels like a whole
new experience!

430
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:33,192
Good, that's fine.

431
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:37,200
Next, take off your bottoms
and get up on the bed.

432
00:31:37,274 --> 00:31:38,036
What?

433
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:40,137
No!

434
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,700
This is just too embarrassing!

435
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:42,972
Let's stop, Toru!

436
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:45,381
I'm not Toru!!!

437
00:31:45,949 --> 00:31:47,940
I'm the doctor!!

438
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:51,579
Listen, Manami.

439
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:54,920
We're doing this so that you
can overcome your shyness.

440
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:58,360
Those shy feelings that
make you want to back out...

441
00:31:58,428 --> 00:32:01,886
or be rescued. They'll
summon your other personality.

442
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:04,662
So you've got to get over
those feelings...

443
00:32:04,734 --> 00:32:07,635
otherwise you'll never
return to your true self.

444
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:10,403
Understand?

445
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:12,465
Mm-hm.

446
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:16,211
Then let me take a look
at your stomach.

447
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:18,042
Yes, Doctor.

448
00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:22,184
Does this hurt here?

449
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:23,918
No.

450
00:32:23,987 --> 00:32:26,080
How about here?

451
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:27,783
Or here?

452
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:31,020
Okay then, down here?

453
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:33,826
What, does this hurt?

454
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:37,022
No, it doesn't hurt.

455
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:40,597
It's a little bit stiff.

456
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,230
I'd better take a closer look.

457
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:45,163
Okay, now first...

458
00:32:45,842 --> 00:32:46,831
What?

459
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:50,471
You MUST do what
the doctor says!

460
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:04,358
Oh, I'm so embarrassed!

461
00:33:04,427 --> 00:33:07,191
I am! I'm so totally
embarrassed!

462
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:10,564
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

463
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:12,192
Pull down your panties,
as well.

464
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:16,439
No way! No way!
I don't want to!

465
00:33:16,506 --> 00:33:17,598
Manami!

466
00:33:17,674 --> 00:33:19,869
This is your one chance
to turn back to normal!

467
00:33:24,181 --> 00:33:30,882
Then you pull down my
panties, Doctor.

468
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:32,485
Who, me?

469
00:33:33,823 --> 00:33:35,017
Yes!

470
00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:41,821
Are you serious?

471
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:48,866
I can't! My hands won't
stop shaking!

472
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:55,707
Don't run... you mustn't
run away!

473
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:56,507
But still!

474
00:33:59,683 --> 00:34:01,378
But... but...

475
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:14,522
Please! That's enough
isn't it, Toru?

476
00:34:21,304 --> 00:34:24,171
No! Don't spread me
open like that!

477
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:26,033
No! No!

478
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:31,436
It feels like air is going
deep inside...

479
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:34,176
Like he's looking so deep
inside of me!

480
00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:46,119
No!

481
00:34:46,196 --> 00:34:47,561
Is that from me?

482
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:48,723
No way!

483
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:51,892
Why's that sound coming
from me?

484
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,032
No...

485
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,774
It feels so good...

486
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:07,438
No...

487
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:09,074
I'm gonna scream...

488
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,892
I... I'm sorry, Manami.

489
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,528
I got carried away.

490
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,605
What happened to Nami?

491
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:36,878
She didn't disappear, did she?

492
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,675
Forget it, you don't need to worry.

493
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,847
You're pretty hot, Toru.

494
00:35:44,321 --> 00:35:46,448
Nami! You're okay?

495
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,079
Yeah.

496
00:35:48,758 --> 00:35:52,990
But how about being a little
more gentle next time?

497
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:54,826
It's really sensitive, you know.

498
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:58,231
Aha, so you didn't disappear.

499
00:35:58,568 --> 00:36:00,798
But when did you two
change over?

500
00:36:01,738 --> 00:36:04,070
When Manami blacked out.

501
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:06,475
But we both felt it.

502
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:08,977
Ever since Manami took
her clothes off.

503
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:13,610
So what was the point
of my whole strategy?

504
00:36:13,683 --> 00:36:15,776
What's with the big act?

505
00:36:15,852 --> 00:36:19,879
More than half of it was just an
amateur treatment by a pervert!

506
00:36:25,995 --> 00:36:27,895
Well, shall we keep going?

507
00:36:28,365 --> 00:36:29,161
Hey!

508
00:36:29,332 --> 00:36:32,199
Don't you think it's too soon?

509
00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:38,099
Now, you must do everything
the doctor tells you!

510
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,043
Nami... you...

511
00:36:42,912 --> 00:36:45,506
Doctor Nami's wearing
her white lab coat...

512
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:48,483
and she won't leave any
patient out in the cold.

513
00:36:48,852 --> 00:36:51,412
See how swollen it is?

514
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:55,617
I'll disinfect it with my mouth
or you won't get any sleep.

515
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:59,255
This looks like a job
for Doctor Nami!

516
00:37:01,264 --> 00:37:02,891
Yes please, Doctor.

517
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:05,765
Okay, since you asked
so sincerely.

518
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,159
Don't worry.

519
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:10,804
I'm the woman you created,
after all.

520
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:13,308
I'll cure you any day.

521
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:27,186
Manami.

522
00:37:27,257 --> 00:37:29,487
I couldn't help you at all.

523
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:32,084
Hey, don't worry about it.

524
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:37,031
Anyway, Nami's helped me
out a few times...

525
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,568
so I think I might just
stay this way for a while.

526
00:37:40,203 --> 00:37:42,194
Manami!

527
00:37:42,806 --> 00:37:45,502
When I took some time off
from college...

528
00:37:45,575 --> 00:37:47,873
I was able to talk to Nami.

529
00:37:47,944 --> 00:37:52,677
She was bawling, saying
she didn't want to disappear.

530
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:56,846
I started feeling sorry for her.

531
00:37:57,854 --> 00:38:00,846
I figured I didn't need to go
out of my way to get rid of her.

532
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:04,786
Nami's me, after all, right?

533
00:38:04,861 --> 00:38:10,356
And I sure know the fear of
feeling that I'd disappear, too.

534
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:14,292
Manami...

535
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:19,107
I'm sure I'll be a real bother
to you again, Toru.

536
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:21,008
You won't be a bother!

537
00:38:21,077 --> 00:38:23,807
It's ME who's gonna try
not to be a nuisance to you.

538
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:27,741
I'll make sure that stupid
Nami doesn't get too violent!

539
00:38:33,189 --> 00:38:35,783
Well excuse me for being stupid!

540
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:38,556
No way!

541
00:38:39,496 --> 00:38:42,829
This mouth sure has a way
of being cheeky!!

542
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:45,999
I didn't think you were gonna
show up!!

543
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:47,798
That's even worse!!

544
00:38:50,473 --> 00:38:52,964
Wait up, Nami!

545
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:57,369
I'll never do you any
naughty favors again!

546
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:01,814
Keep your voice down, idiot!

547
00:39:07,023 --> 00:39:12,825
I tell you, you're gonna get
Manami in trouble!!!
