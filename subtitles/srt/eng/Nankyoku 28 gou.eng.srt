1
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:23,898
I had a dream about Kozue.

2
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:28,005
I met her at Shonan Beach.
We're in the same prep school.

3
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:30,413
We just started dating but...

4
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:32,209
Definitely...

5
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:34,378
I'm gonna get some!

6
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:38,448
Aiwa-kun!

7
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:26,260
HEY!!

8
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,286
Ka-chan, who's this girl?

9
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:53,389
Who's she? Who are YOU?!

10
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:58,930
You have ME! I'll never forgive you
for cheating on me with this girl!

11
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:01,234
WHAT?! Aiwa! What's going on?

12
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:04,104
No...nothing. It's not true!

13
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:07,275
You dick! Goodbye!

14
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:11,009
Whoa! Wait! Kozue! Gulp Huh?

15
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,784
What... What are you... doing?

16
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:26,157
Don't stop.

17
00:02:56,895 --> 00:03:02,595
DUTCH WIFE 28

18
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:23,346
Shiiiitt! What a mess!

19
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,685
Today's my first date with Kozue.

20
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:37,762
Good morning!

21
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:11,093
What am I thinking?! I'm not
supposed to look at other girls!

22
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:13,469
I'm going out with Kozue!

23
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:16,396
Well...a cool guy
like me can't help it.

24
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:22,677
I'm smart, good-looking,
cool, athletic, good at karaoke

25
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:25,043
and tough in a fight! I'm too
perfect for even the slightest flaw.

26
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:30,753
And what's more... I'm dating
Kozue! HA HA HA HA

27
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:38,053
Are you O.K., mister?

28
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,635
Look at all the porno magazines!!

29
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:47,736
WOW!

30
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:49,971
YIKES! No! Stop it! Don't look!

31
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:53,910
Kids these days are so damn careless.

32
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:56,743
Come on, Miki! This guy's a pervert.

33
00:04:57,249 --> 00:04:59,046
Shut up, you brats!

34
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:01,218
YAAH! Pervert!

35
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:06,515
Kids these days shouldn't
hold hands like that!

36
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:09,618
Preparatory School
Summer Session

37
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:23,505
What's so fun about having
to go to summer session?

38
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:28,406
How can I study when my body
is in its sexual prime?!

39
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:30,677
All the other geeks have
no other choice though!

40
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:34,846
They're not going out on a
date like me! HEH HEH HEH

41
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:46,329
And just what will
Kozue be wearing?

42
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:52,062
Sorry I'm late!

43
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:01,238
Kozue!

44
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:04,746
Having dirty thoughts,
weren't you, Aiwa?

45
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:27,727
First off, start the date as usual.

46
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:31,641
Eat ice cream in the park.
And what am I going to do next?

47
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:36,411
I'm gonna get some
on the first date...

48
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,691
That was good!

49
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,728
I have to get going.
Thanks for the ice cream.

50
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:34,170
What?! Already?

51
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:35,730
Yeah. See you next time.

52
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:37,340
So soon?

53
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:39,843
Sorry but I really have to go.

54
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:43,509
Well... What about tomorrow?
Wanna go swimming?

55
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:48,642
Tomorrow? Well... OK. That's fine.

56
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:50,413
Alright!

57
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:52,583
I'll walk you to the station.

58
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:54,514
Thanks!

59
00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:02,189
(Singing ) Pool! Pool!
Good times tomorrow!

60
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,692
Good times at the pool!
At the pool with Kozue!

61
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:18,038
Excuse me. Katsu Aiwa?

62
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:20,181
Umm... that's me.

63
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:23,920
Great! Can you sign for this?

64
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:24,980
For me?

65
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:27,957
OH! That order!

66
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:31,920
That was two months ago!

67
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:34,695
I have no sexual
experience so I got this.

68
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:38,294
I'm curious and can't stand waiting
any longer to get my dick wet.

69
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:43,707
I ordered a Dutch wife named
South Pole No. 5 from a catalog.

70
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:50,878
I completely forgot about
It 'til it came today.

71
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,276
It said ''Please enjoy her
in the costumes of your choice.''

72
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:08,294
South Pole No. 28?
That's strange. I ordered No. 5.

73
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:11,463
They screwed up the order.

74
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:14,702
Am I gonna have to send it back?

75
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:28,850
This is...

76
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:39,719
the exact same girl I
dreamt about this morning!

77
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:04,349
I have a girlfriend though.
She's of no use to me now but...

78
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,394
I guess I can train on her
until I finally nail Kozue.

79
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:19,259
Wow, not bad at all. They
did a really good job.

80
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:29,779
She even speaks?!

81
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:08,319
Where am I? Who are you?

82
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,279
She spoke?!?!

83
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:17,087
What the hell is all this?

84
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:21,256
She's a robot?!

85
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,366
What are you looking at?

86
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,673
I don't believe it!
Has technology advanced this far?!

87
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:42,580
Wait a sec! If she's a
Dutch wife robot, that means...

88
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:50,323
she's going to need
programming first.

89
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:55,392
You really don't know anything?

90
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:00,401
Alright. I'm gonna teach a few things.

91
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:05,336
This is my house.
I'm Katsu, your master.

92
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:08,009
Master?

93
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:12,311
You can call me ''Ka-chan''.
You'll do whatever I tell you.

94
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:16,919
And who am I?

95
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:22,924
You are Number Twenty....
No! Hmmm. Satomi. You're Satomi!

96
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:25,988
Satomi? I'm Satomi.

97
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:31,726
That's right. Satomi, you love me.
You'll never stop loving me.

98
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:33,403
Ka-chan, I love you!

99
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:35,803
Ka-chan, I love you!

100
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:38,837
HEH HEH. This ain't so bad!

101
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:49,647
So this is a robot!
Not much different than a human.

102
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:55,085
No, her cuteness... her beauty...
they surpass human levels.

103
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:58,022
She's a super beauty female robot!

104
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,761
Hey, Ka-chan! Am I cute?

105
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,932
Yeah. Yeah. Cute! Cute!

106
00:13:06,237 --> 00:13:08,637
Satomi's happy! Super happy!

107
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:10,805
Super happy!

108
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:23,381
Ka-chan!

109
00:13:23,655 --> 00:13:29,321
Sa... Satomi, you have to do
whatever I say? Do you understand?

110
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:31,126
Yes, I understand.

111
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:36,127
Ka-chan!

112
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:41,104
Lovers do it like this. Five times a day!
As much as I want.

113
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:42,800
As much as you want.
We do anything!

114
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:49,670
Harder. Suck harder!

115
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:51,973
It feels good!

116
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:57,514
It does, right? I studied techniques
from magazines and videos.

117
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:05,622
There! There!

118
00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:44,259
Alright! Let's have you
use your mouth and lick this.

119
00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:46,160
Is it good?

120
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:48,197
Yes. It tastes very good.

121
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:58,344
It does! It tastes really good!

122
00:15:01,252 --> 00:15:04,153
Your doing well.
Next, put it in your mouth.

123
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:17,392
Dreams just can't
compare to the real thing.

124
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:27,334
Now you have to
really bob and suck it!

125
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:51,759
She's just like a
human down here too.

126
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,144
Are we finished?

127
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:05,909
No, it just gets better from here.

128
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:34,303
Ka-chan! Ka-chan...

129
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,852
Ohh! This feels so good!

130
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:08,972
No! This sucks!
Here it comes!

131
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:18,048
Oh, Ka-chan, more!
It feels good...

132
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:56,089
Ka-chan! Ka-chan! Get up!

133
00:17:57,195 --> 00:17:57,889
Get up, Ka-chan!

134
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:11,070
I'm alright!

135
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:17,637
You scared me. You weren't
moving so I thought you were dead.

136
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,112
Phew! It doesn't last
as long as they say it does.

137
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:24,549
I gotta prepare for
when I'm with Kozue.

138
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:26,580
I have to work on my stamina.

139
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:28,422
WHOA! It's big again!

140
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:31,492
What're you're doing?

141
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:34,560
Well, didn't you tell me earlier...

142
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:37,762
Well, didn't you tell me earlier...

143
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:41,003
So... four more times!

144
00:19:24,315 --> 00:19:25,304
More!

145
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:48,266
Three more times!

146
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:20,398
Two more times!

147
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:44,392
Ka-chan, don't pretend to sleep!

148
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:48,128
Let me sleep.

149
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:51,267
One more time!

150
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:31,871
Ka-chan, let's do it five more times!

151
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:43,585
Delicious!

152
00:22:00,304 --> 00:22:03,000
She eats food too?

153
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:07,743
Ah, Ka-chan, you don't want that?
I'll take it!

154
00:22:18,489 --> 00:22:20,957
Robots sleep?!!

155
00:22:27,832 --> 00:22:30,858
Ka-chan, let's do it!

156
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:34,230
But we just did it after
we got back from dinner.

157
00:22:47,718 --> 00:22:50,050
FOUR MORE TIMES!!!

158
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:04,701
We did it over and
over until morning.

159
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:05,930
Ka-chan!

160
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:09,066
I wanna do it once more!

161
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:10,401
What?

162
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:15,705
Come on, Ka-chan, Let's do it!

163
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:19,649
Hurry! come on, Ka-chan!

164
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,650
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

165
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:24,348
What if somebody sees you?

166
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:31,426
Excuse us.

167
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,794
I told you to stay in the room.

168
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,363
Satomi was sad.

169
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:39,564
I wanted to feel good
again with you!

170
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:44,269
I have a date... I mean...
I'm going out. We can't.

171
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:47,733
Just listen to me and
do what I say. OK?

172
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:53,308
Ka-chan, do you hate me?

173
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:54,818
What?

174
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:59,122
I don't want you to hate me so
I wanna become even more pretty.

175
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:03,382
What can I do to become
more beautiful?

176
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:08,593
Well, let me see...
You should have some pee on you.

177
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,260
Then you'll be beautiful.

178
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:13,694
Stay at home.

179
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:20,405
Pee, right...

180
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,282
Kozue hasn't shown up yet.

181
00:24:37,428 --> 00:24:39,760
Maybe she wasn't feeling
well and skipped class.

182
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:45,593
First we go swimming.
Then next is the amusement park.

183
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,967
There are steps to get her
into bed with me quickly.

184
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:54,572
Aiwa!

185
00:24:56,647 --> 00:24:57,773
I'm so sorry!

186
00:24:57,781 --> 00:24:58,907
Kozue!

187
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:03,220
I was worried about you.
I thought you were sick.

188
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,920
No, nothing like that but...
I can't make it today.

189
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:09,722
WHAT?!

190
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:14,155
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you soon.

191
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:17,395
Well, if you really can't
go there's nothing I can do.

192
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:20,370
As long as you make it up
to me another time. HA HA HA

193
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:23,340
Kozue!
What's taking so long?

194
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,365
Just a minute, Masaki.
I'm coming.

195
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:28,269
Ma... Masaki?

196
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,769
See you later.

197
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:33,543
What are you doing, stupid?
Who's he?

198
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,848
It's nothing.
He's just a friend.

199
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:41,415
Huh?
She has a boyfriend?

200
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:51,928
Shit!
Now I'm pissed off!

201
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:57,196
I'm gonna fuck South Pole No. 28
Satomi till she breaks!

202
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:00,439
She's in love with me.
And she's just a toy...

203
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:04,244
So I can do whatever
I want to her. HEH HEH HEH

204
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:07,917
Satomi, I'm home.

205
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:15,983
Satomi?

206
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:20,324
Are you hiding?

207
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:23,190
Satomi, where are you?

208
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:25,327
It can't be.

209
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:28,305
The company came and took her
back because the order was wrong?

210
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:39,342
I've been dumped by that
no brain robot No. 28?

211
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,811
HA HA
I'm such a loser.

212
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:47,853
Hey, this is what you
wanted, right?

213
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,985
Her skin is so shiny.

214
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:07,835
Well, enough of this.
I'll take care of this horny, little bitch.

215
00:27:09,113 --> 00:27:10,045
I'll be the first one...

216
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:14,114
to fuck her brains out.

217
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,485
What are you doing?

218
00:27:17,488 --> 00:27:21,117
You know what I'm doing.
It'll feel good.

219
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:24,827
Stop it! Ka-chan's the only
one who can do that to me!

220
00:27:24,828 --> 00:27:29,663
What's that? She's Katsu girlfriend?
So we don't have to worry. Let's do it.

221
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:32,965
Stop it! Get off me!

222
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,803
Stop!

223
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:38,639
Be quiet!

224
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:46,415
That stupid No. 28...
She might have just gone for a walk.

225
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,025
Kozue?

226
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,858
Let's go to the pool together.

227
00:28:00,864 --> 00:28:02,354
What about your boyfriend?

228
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:04,800
It's OK.
Don't worry about him.

229
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:07,635
I didn't think
Masaki was that stubborn.

230
00:28:07,638 --> 00:28:11,074
I want to go have fun.
Let's go swimming!

231
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:18,341
Let's go have some fun!
Wait a sec while I grab my things.

232
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:28,552
Have fun? Awesome!
I'll make sure you have A LOT of fun!

233
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,792
The tide is turning for me.
I'm gonna score with Kozue! YAHOO!

234
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:38,957
Is something in there?

235
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:41,729
HI!

236
00:28:41,738 --> 00:28:44,229
Going out again, Ka-chan?

237
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:52,212
Oh, shit! If Kozue finds out about
Satomi, she'll think I'm a pervert.

238
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:54,716
Kozue, let's hurry up.

239
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,478
Sounds like she knows you, Aiwa.

240
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:01,390
No, she must have been mistaken.

241
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:08,658
Recently there are lots
of perverts around here.

242
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:09,665
Again?!

243
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,963
What?

244
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:16,672
Am I prettier now?

245
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:27,474
Kozue, I think this girl's lost.
Let me show her the way.

246
00:29:27,484 --> 00:29:29,679
Wait just a minute.

247
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:33,588
Listen here, you. This is the
wrong way to Yabu Hospital

248
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:37,659
Just what do you
think you're doing?

249
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:40,824
What are you doing, Ka-chan?
I'm not asking directions.

250
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,966
Who's that girl, Kozue?

251
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:46,265
It's none of your business!

252
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:48,733
Ka-chan!

253
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:53,207
Go home!

254
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:03,609
Kozue, thanks for wait...

255
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:05,981
Don't sulk, you baby.

256
00:30:05,989 --> 00:30:08,514
What?! I was just
talking to a friend.

257
00:30:08,525 --> 00:30:10,891
It's nothing to get angry over.

258
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:13,262
You idiot! Don't you get it?
I'm in love with you.

259
00:30:14,431 --> 00:30:15,056
Masaki...

260
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:19,158
Any more nonsense though
and we're finished.

261
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:22,167
Masaki...

262
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:25,303
Masaki...

263
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:30,539
Did you have something to do?

264
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:32,014
No, nothing.

265
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,749
Ka-chan? Ka-chan?

266
00:30:43,193 --> 00:30:44,990
Ka-chan, are you alright?

267
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:47,922
Satomi...

268
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:53,564
Ka-chan, you were out
for while. Are you OK?

269
00:30:55,973 --> 00:30:58,134
Were you... were you
here the whole time?

270
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:04,547
Feel better, Ka-chan.
You have me!

271
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:05,640
Satomi...

272
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:11,219
Why do you smell like piss?

273
00:31:11,221 --> 00:31:14,349
I had these guys pee on me.

274
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,388
You... you took what
I said... seriously?!

275
00:31:20,397 --> 00:31:22,388
Yeah. There was so much.

276
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,094
What have I done?!

277
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:28,595
Then they held me down
and tried to have fun with me.

278
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:31,199
What?! Did they do
something to you?

279
00:31:35,746 --> 00:31:37,304
You're all scraped up.

280
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:43,014
But I didn't do it with them.
I knew you'd get mad.

281
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:45,513
Satomi...

282
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:48,716
I got away from them.

283
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:53,520
Satomi!

284
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:56,159
Ka-chan!

285
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:05,441
You... I didn't think
about your feelings at all.

286
00:32:05,442 --> 00:32:07,603
I'm... I'm... such a dick!

287
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:12,212
No, you're not, Ka-chan.
You're wonderful!

288
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:13,677
Satomi!

289
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:16,175
Ka-chan! Let's do it!

290
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:17,915
Yeah, let's do it!

291
00:32:27,964 --> 00:32:30,455
Katsu, you're doing well, I see.

292
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:33,363
Ka-chan, it was these guys...

293
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,701
What?

294
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:35,967
We were looking for you, honey.

295
00:32:35,972 --> 00:32:41,433
You ran away right in the middle of things.
How were we supposed to finish?

296
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:42,070
I'm scared.

297
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:45,841
Why so defensive?

298
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:55,585
Ka-chan!

299
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,122
That's just like him.

300
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:04,599
Alright, you horny bitch,
let's finish what we started.

301
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:09,529
Sneak Attack!

302
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:13,498
Satomi, run!

303
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:16,411
Why, you...

304
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,711
Katsu, you asshole!

305
00:33:22,452 --> 00:33:25,250
I'll never forgive anyone
who hurts my girlfriend.

306
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:29,325
Don't fuck with us!

307
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,107
Keep your hands off my girlfriend!

308
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:11,798
What was he trying
to do back there?

309
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:13,702
He never fought back before.

310
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:21,043
Ka-chan, stay with me now.

311
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:25,139
Satomi...

312
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,513
What?

313
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:29,178
If you're OK with me...

314
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:33,656
won't you stay...
by my side... forever?

315
00:34:36,426 --> 00:34:37,358
Ka-chan!

316
00:34:41,465 --> 00:34:43,490
Ka-chan! Ka-chan!

317
00:34:54,444 --> 00:34:57,880
Tear me apart! You're a
real animal today, Ka-chan!

318
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,716
I'm just paying you back... for
taking care of me with all your heart.

319
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:07,553
I'm on fire today!

320
00:35:08,892 --> 00:35:13,488
Until morning... until my
back breaks... I'm gonna do you!

321
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,628
Ka-chan!

00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:31,810
Summer ended. Then autumn came.
Now winter has arrived.

323
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:33,577
It's been over 6 months

324
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:38,384
but it doesn't look like the company is
coming to take my South Pole No. 28 back.

325
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:45,023
Ka-chan, I'll be finished
with this scarf soon.

326
00:35:52,502 --> 00:35:58,236
No, not South Pole No. 28...
Satomi! In my mind...

327
00:35:59,276 --> 00:36:06,148
She's not a robot.
She's become human.

328
00:36:05,982 --> 00:36:08,473
Ka-chan
