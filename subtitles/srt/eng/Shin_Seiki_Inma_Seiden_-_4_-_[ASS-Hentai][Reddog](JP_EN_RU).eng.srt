1
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:12,118
So far, three weapons have been collected.

2
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,592
And if all of the guards
get a weapon, then there's...

3
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:17,720
So, what will happen?

4
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:20,695
The world as we know it will end.

5
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:29,169
I don't know why
the Auntie went so far.

6
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:31,369
But one thing is for sure:

7
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:37,844
The students have been destroyed,
and become the guards' sheaths.

8
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:41,245
Why is this happening to our college?

9
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,686
This has been a sinister land
since a long time ago.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,252
That's why I've been
worshiping the Dakini Goddess.

11
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:56,736
Moreover, our college is located
right in the center of the land.

12
00:00:56,903 --> 00:01:01,237
So it's easy to have some girls
with a certain tendency...

13
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:07,573
like Sena Yamamoto,
and Reiko Koga. And Suzune Takasu.

14
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:10,911
But even if Auntie is egoistic...

15
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:15,454
she won't want to destroy
herself along with the world.

16
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:18,046
There's just no way, I'm sure of it.

17
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:22,225
I guess you could be as egoistic as she.

18
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:25,594
Don't eavesdrop, Takashi.
That's not fair.

19
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:31,469
The only thing we know for sure is...

20
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:34,132
we can't allow this to continue...

21
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:37,733
we can't keep it a secret.
We need to tell the students about it.

22
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:39,277
Don't you agree?

23
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:45,434
So, people with the Sanskrit tattoo...

24
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:47,742
Will become the targets of Ironmask.

25
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:50,247
So, Suzune?

26
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:55,888
I surrender.

27
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:58,254
Don't stand there.

28
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,757
How can we concentrate like this?

29
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:04,353
Moeka, Mao said she'd help us.

30
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:06,857
- Moeka...
- Don't touch me!

31
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,898
Why now, then?

32
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,093
What do you want, now?

33
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:13,798
If you had only had the presence
to come down a bit...

34
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:15,406
Moeka, stop it.

35
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:17,170
Moeka, I'm sorry.

36
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,178
My apologies.

37
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,007
No!

38
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,441
Moeka...

39
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,775
Are you sure you want to be like this?

40
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:29,515
It doesn't matter anyway.
Mao's no longer my friend.

41
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:31,181
That's not what you really think.

42
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,990
What? So you know everything!

43
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:38,163
But you that's not what I was trying to say.

44
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,833
What happened?
What can't you tell me?

45
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,231
What's such a big secret?

46
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:46,197
I'm scared.

47
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,305
Yes.

48
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:04,016
Feels so good.

49
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,230
I can't take it anymore.

50
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:26,136
What's that?

51
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,711
Is that the Sanskrit that Kaori
talked about?

52
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:36,782
I don't know.

53
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:40,415
If so, I'll be killed. This isn't good.

54
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,527
Mao, what happens then?

55
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:45,321
No, that's awful.

56
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:46,725
Well?

57
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,529
Don't expect that of Mao.
That's what happened to Suzune.

58
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,504
So, what should we do?

59
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:56,698
Don't worry, I would protect you!

60
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,301
- Ayano.
- Takashi!

61
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:02,781
You haven't come
to the tennis club lately.

62
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:06,279
Sorry. I haven't had time, that's all.

63
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:12,388
Sorry. I told her not to go.
Please don't blame her. Blame me.

64
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,516
Moeka, stop it.

65
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:16,921
I don't mean to blame her.

66
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:20,555
I'm one of the old boys
at the tennis club.

67
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:26,702
Moeka, you have to be quiet.
Sorry, Takashi.

68
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,807
- Miss Hitomi!
- Get out of my way.

69
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:34,412
Watch yourself, and don't get too far.

70
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:36,071
Don't get too far!

71
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:44,289
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,717
Moeka is right.

73
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,623
I got you killed.

74
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:54,156
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

75
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,636
But I've made up my mind.

76
00:05:56,936 --> 00:06:01,339
I won't let the Ironmask
to hurt anybody anymore.

77
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,374
I'll protect everybody!

78
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:06,869
Please bless us.

79
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:09,337
Sena.

80
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:18,113
You're just in time!
I've been waiting for you.

81
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:24,990
Aren't you going to wait?
Haven't you been looking for me?

82
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:35,306
Wait! Tell me something!

83
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:38,809
Who's your next target?
Please tell me!

84
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:47,018
It's interesting.
The Ironmask seems to care for Mao.

85
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,450
Yeah?

86
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,485
Anyway...

87
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:56,484
Ironmask doesn't
seem that evil today.

88
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:00,466
Who cares what he thinks!

89
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,100
My job is to protect my lady.

90
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:08,436
If any more of Mao's friends die,
she will never recover.

91
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:10,075
We can't let that happen.

92
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,634
The streets are filled with obscenity.

93
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,975
It's easy to have girls to become sheaths.

94
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:20,710
Wish I could understand
Auntie Himiko better.

95
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,720
Right, Bodai?

96
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:28,485
He is a puppet.
Is that right? He's a puppet.

97
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:31,596
All I'm saying is that
he's just totally useless.

98
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:33,423
Nothing more than that.

99
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,026
So, he should be fired.

100
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:43,207
Anyway, we should return
to Mao's kindness.

101
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:55,521
No, don't go.

102
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,329
Could it be the Forbidden World?

103
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:11,899
Oasa! What's going on?

104
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:21,277
What are you doing? Oasa!

105
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:39,659
I summon you!

106
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,512
Let me go!

107
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:11,561
You're disgusting.

108
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,703
No!

109
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,151
No!

110
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:45,487
What's going on? Strange feeling.

111
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:46,821
Stop it!

112
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,572
No!

113
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,758
It hurts!

114
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:17,193
Protection Cloak!

115
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:31,065
Mother.

116
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:36,941
What, Oasa, you look terrible.

117
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,876
I knew what you and Sagawa were up to.

118
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:44,215
You can't accomplish anything anyhow.

119
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,588
That's why I'm going to let you go.

120
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,988
But I won't allow you to hurt
my lovely daughter Hitomi.

121
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:47,509
I don't know why I put up
with you, you're crazy, Kaori!

122
00:11:56,996 --> 00:12:00,227
You must know that
I accept your challenge, Kaori.

123
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:04,025
Hitomi, don't stay up so late, go home.

124
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:06,237
Why don't you just leave me alone?

125
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:10,807
Hitomi, what happened?
Are you okay?

126
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:14,808
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.
I'll be okay now.

127
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:17,877
You silly!
I watched you grow up...

128
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:20,849
I should be trying to protect you,
don't you now what I'm talking about?

129
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:31,220
Sister Rikako, it's all your fault.

130
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:36,465
So, this is where...

131
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:39,471
they were attacked by the monsters.

132
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,402
And the Ironmask took Sena away.

133
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,013
Moeka, it's okay!
Sena will be back.

134
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:54,848
Soon we'll make up with Mao.
You'll see. Please don't cry.

135
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:56,351
No!

136
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,686
I don't need Mao! I don't need her!

137
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,018
Do you understand what I'm saying?

138
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,229
But for now, it's better to discuss
with Mao and Kaori.

139
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:18,472
What's going on with all these crows!

140
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:21,607
Takashi! The target is Ayano!

141
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:34,056
Takashi.

142
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:37,057
You shouldn't do this
to your own pretty schoolmate.

143
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,727
So it's you that's in Oasa's way!

144
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:46,337
Overconfidence will lead to failure.

145
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:02,947
Good, that's good.

146
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:06,449
Let me go.

147
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:07,648
Let me go!

148
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,690
Stop!

149
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:17,759
I'm not Rikako, let me go!

150
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:21,329
No! Please stop, Fujio!

151
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:24,899
Enough! I'm tired of wayward women.

152
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:27,571
How could you! My sister!

153
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:29,575
Poor Himiko.

154
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:32,943
Rikako, I've loved you
for a long time.

155
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:36,786
How can it be? Poor Himiko!

156
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:41,288
I'm so sorry Himiko!

157
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:44,155
Please forgive me.

158
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,868
Feels so good, Rikako.

159
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:00,605
Rikako, yeah!

160
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:04,312
I'm not, please!

161
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,858
Rikako, don't go!

162
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:28,103
Rikako!

163
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:33,134
Rikako, don't go.

164
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,051
Beware of Himiko.

165
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:43,880
She wants to kill you.

166
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,395
Yeah, right there.

167
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,160
Baby!

168
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:03,333
Excuse me, Madame Himiko.

169
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,569
Saeko got out of the prison.

170
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:07,505
Go away.

171
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,851
- Get out of here!
- Yes, ma'am.

172
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:17,921
Takashi!

173
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,652
Why?

174
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:30,724
Rikako! Sister!

175
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,639
Himiko.

176
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:44,049
It's all your fault, Rikako.
You didn't listen to me.

177
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,242
Stupid girl.

178
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:48,785
I am going to ruin everything
precious to you.

179
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:53,823
Himiko, so those kids...

180
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:57,886
you hurt them.
I won't let you do this again.

181
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:01,556
Rikako Sister, die then.

182
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:08,503
Himiko, stop!

183
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,409
It's your fault, right.

184
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:18,477
Right, it's your fault.

185
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,255
Yeah, yeah.

186
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:31,929
Baby, yes.

187
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,334
So good!

188
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,296
What's up, Saeko teacher?

189
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:14,366
Kaori!

190
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:17,999
- You'll catch a cold.
- Kaori!

191
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:19,844
Himiko.

192
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:21,444
Good.

193
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,138
You haven't told anybody about Himiko?

194
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:25,945
Have you?

195
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:27,345
Kaori.

196
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:30,654
We don't want any more rumors.

197
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,782
You're appointed.
You must have understood!

198
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,790
Saeko teacher.

199
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:38,219
So, am I right?

200
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:42,991
I'll leave her to you, Bodai.

201
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,853
What do you want me for at this hour?

202
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:05,479
Suzune's dead.
Ayano could be next!

203
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:09,060
What's it got to do with me?

204
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:13,163
Takashi, were you spying on us
in the park today?

205
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,360
Watch your mouth!

206
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:18,427
Please don't hurt Ayano.

207
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:23,397
What should a woman do when
she asks for help from a man?

208
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:36,277
What? Don't you want
to save Ayano?

209
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:39,980
Mao.

210
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:48,223
As you desire, sir.

211
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:58,667
Don't waste my time, okay?

212
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:03,338
Hey, sometimes it's good
to have small ones.

213
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:08,109
That's it. Be good.
Then Ayano will be okay.

214
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:16,728
How pure!

215
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:34,337
What a naughty girl.

216
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,209
I'll give you a lesson.

217
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:37,746
Not there.

218
00:20:40,286 --> 00:20:42,049
No, not there!

219
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:46,548
No! Don't put your fingers in there!

220
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:05,174
No!

221
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:08,246
Don't you care about Ayano?

222
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:17,618
Yes, Moeka had disappeared after she
said she'll meet someone.

223
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:20,087
She's gone?
Where could she be?

224
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:23,194
- We've got to look for her, now!
- Okay.

225
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:26,358
Moeka, please take it easy!

226
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:52,413
- Let me go.
- No way.

227
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:56,424
No!

228
00:21:58,397 --> 00:21:59,955
Be quiet!

229
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:05,265
Little bitch!

230
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:06,699
Trick me?

231
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:16,342
Help!

232
00:22:16,682 --> 00:22:17,740
Stop!

233
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,078
Why don't you give up, little girl?

234
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:20,913
Please let me go.

235
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:24,622
It hurts!

236
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:40,634
How about that? I'm all the way in.

237
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:44,472
It hurts.

238
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:47,538
Virgins are so tight.

239
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:55,313
No, stop!

240
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:08,526
I hope this will...

241
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,830
She's got the same...

242
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:41,762
I can't take it anymore!

243
00:24:04,857 --> 00:24:06,757
What is that?

244
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:09,384
Kishibojin Shrine.

245
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:38,450
Number four.

246
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:42,792
Moeka.

247
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:45,153
Get up, Moeka.

248
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:46,856
What happened, Moeka?

249
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:48,262
What happened?

250
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:50,058
Moeka!

251
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,805
Moeka!

252
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:01,241
I'm so sorry.

253
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:08,341
No.

254
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:15,821
Moeka.

255
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:33,643
No! Moeka!
