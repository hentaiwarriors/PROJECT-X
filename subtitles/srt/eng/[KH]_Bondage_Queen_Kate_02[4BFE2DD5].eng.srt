1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,210
Now I'm going into the
center of the organization.

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,310
You'II pay for steaIing my virginity!

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,380
Here we are. This is
the slave training room.

4
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,250
No way... No!

5
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,850
The transmission's ready, Sir.

6
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,390
What's going on with Kate Curtis?

7
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,080
Captain, caII Smith.

8
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,360
Yes, Sir.

9
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,560
This is Smith, Sir.

10
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,160
Smith, how are things going?

11
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,970
We'II be in the area where we
Iost her signaI in about 30 minutes.

12
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,200
Enough time for five more songs.

13
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,770
I'II Ieave it to you untiI you find them.

14
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,770
Do whatever you can.

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,740
Yes, Sir.

16
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,480
It's showtime!

17
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,790
Listen. The success of
this operation is up to us.

18
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,770
If worse comes to worse, we may
have to give up on Lieutenant Curtis...

19
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,930
...in order to find their hideout.

20
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,800
I know we'II have to
confront the UIfan sooner or Iater.

21
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,410
So, what do you think?

22
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,320
This is the UIfan's true sustenance.

23
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,060
We have a Iot more hideouts bigger
than this one throughout the gaIaxy.

24
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,770
These sIaves are the
ones we kidnapped...

25
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,700
...from remote tourist
spots or spaceships.

26
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,520
Am I going to be trained Iike that?

27
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,950
No, I won't make you a sIave.

28
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,110
Then, what wiII I be?

29
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,780
For now, I'II keep you as a pet.

30
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,150
Pet? You mean you're
going to train me to be your pet?

31
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,570
Dick is working pretty hard.

32
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,540
You're doing pretty good.

33
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,600
Hey, Bro.

34
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,510
You reaIIy trained them good.

35
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,810
Even I can take care of them.

36
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,020
Here, Amy. Greet Bro and Kate.

37
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,490
Yes, Master Dick.

38
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,530
Why is she gIaring at me?

39
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,360
What did I ever do to her?

40
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,610
I'm Mr. Brick's pet
Amy. I just turned 19.

41
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,650
Wow, she's so naked.

42
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,850
Is she an exhibitionist or something?

43
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,540
Very good.

44
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,120
This is how to greet
someone as their pet.

45
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,820
What the heII?

46
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,560
How about that, huh? Look at
her carefuIIy and remember it weII.

47
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,760
I can't!

48
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,940
Fuck! Who does he think I am?

49
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,410
Bro, pIease stop it!

50
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,150
If you keep doing this, you'II kiII the girI!

51
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,650
Shut up!

52
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,250
Don't teII me what to do!

53
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,190
Never...

54
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
Shit!

55
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,610
What an insuIting pose...

56
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,610
I'm...

57
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,140
HoId on.

58
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,690
Oh, no!

59
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,460
You can start now!

60
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,590
I'm Kate the pet. I'm going
to be trained from today on.

61
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:59,900
I just Iost my virginity
but I can't get enough.

62
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,170
I'm such a horny sIut, but I'II
make my best effort to be a good pet.

63
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,380
PIease train me very weII.

64
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,250
What the heII am I saying?

65
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,530
Good, Kate. AIways respect Amy
as the senior pet and Iearn from her.

66
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,330
Senior pet? So, I'm second in Iine?

67
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,430
Answer me!

68
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes, Sir!

69
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,810
It depends on your taste,
but I Iike both of their faces.

70
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,990
For hair, I Iike Amy's better.

71
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,720
Dark and wet. It's reaIIy sexy.

72
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,530
I didn't choose to be a red head.

73
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,700
But for body, I Iike Kate better.

74
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,270
I have confidence in my breasts!

75
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,910
But Amy is taking pituitary drugs,
so she'II have great breasts soon.

76
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,380
What's that?

77
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,350
So, how are your private parts?

78
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,730
I see the hard training is working.

79
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,300
This squeeze is reaIIy strong.

80
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:40,680
Master Brick...
PIease... Master, pIease.

81
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,400
You can't!

82
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,310
What can't I do, Kate?

83
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,190
No... Um...

84
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,750
Amy is my pet.

85
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,620
I can do whatever I want with her.

86
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,750
But... That is... But...

87
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,200
But I'm your pet,
too. You just said that.

88
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,370
It's not fair if you just touch her.

89
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:18,440
If you train me weII, I
can do a Iot better than her!

90
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,760
I see. Now you're
wiIIing to take your training.

91
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,320
What?

92
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,730
Dick, I'm Ieaving Amy to you.

93
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,770
Okay, Bro.

94
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,400
Master Brick!

95
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,030
Don't worry, I'm not abandoning you.

96
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,070
It's just untiI Dick gets used to training.

97
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,070
She reaIIy Iikes Brick.

98
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,310
That's why...

99
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,650
Why him?

100
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,790
Nothing above point NW9.

101
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,490
Nothing above point N3.

102
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,160
Nothing around point NE5.

103
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,840
Are you sure we're in the right pIace?

104
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,730
Yes. We Iost the transmission
within a kiIometer of here.

105
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,310
Find the entrance to the
hideout or the Iieutenant's signaI.

106
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,540
Whatever it takes!

107
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,180
So, what's the
training? A whip? A candIe?

108
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,460
First, you'II be put
into a box of sand worms.

109
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,130
You mean that sand worm?

110
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,330
I'II be eaten aIive!

111
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,500
Don't worry, there's onIy babies.

112
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,170
About the size of your finger.

113
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,880
It's just that there
are thousands of them.

114
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,440
What?

115
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,560
What? What do you want?

116
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,930
How dare you disgrace me
Iike that in front of the boss.

117
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,190
Don't be so embarrassed.

118
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,860
It's no big deaI to
faiI picking up a woman.

119
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,200
My promotion was
postponed because of that.

120
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,370
Don't act Iike a kid.
Kate is good game...

121
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,370
...but a promotion is based on
more than just picking up a woman.

122
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,780
You are saying I'm Iacking something?

123
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,320
You bastard!

124
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:53,100
Not bad, Jenkins.
A good, tough punch.

125
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,670
Not just that, I'II make you feeI good.

126
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,640
Watch out!

127
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,040
Kate!

128
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,050
Bitch!

129
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,750
Kate!

130
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,950
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

131
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,350
How are you, Brick?

132
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,690
He's about to get beat up.

133
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
Brick!

134
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,990
Listen. Don't touch my Kate again.

135
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,370
My Kate?

136
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,300
Shit...

137
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,010
Yo, Cathy, I didn't see you upstairs.

138
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,490
You're Iate.

139
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,510
Yeah, I pIayed a IittIe with Jenkins.

140
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,290
I see.

141
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,730
Who's this woman?

142
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,030
So, how is he now?

143
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,230
Taking a nap.

144
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,400
Oh, my.

145
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,070
So, is this her?
The gaIaxy poIice officer?

146
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,810
Yeah, I'II introduce her to
you. This is Lieutenant Kate.

147
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,480
Oh, she's pretty.

148
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,020
Not that great.

149
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,420
You're much more gorgeous today.

150
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,560
Thank you. I'm gIad to hear
such a compIiment from you.

151
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,230
But I've never seen you
taking care of a pet before.

152
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,340
I just want her to fetch a good price.

153
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,500
That's good.
The cut shouId heaI soon.

154
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,370
Here, Kate. Greet Cathy.

155
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,760
Bro, where are you going Iike that?

156
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,500
He'II pay...

157
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,130
You'd better take care of your injuries.

158
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,000
Shut up!

159
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,140
He's going to pay...

160
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,980
Lieutenant, we've detected the signaI!

161
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,260
What? Where is it?

162
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,020
Show me on the screen.

163
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,130
In the NNW2 zone.

164
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,520
Good. Send the order to scrambIe.

165
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,680
I'm getting trained
starting today. I'm Kate.

166
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,680
PIease teach me to be a good pet.

167
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,070
It's okay. You didn't know...

168
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:29,540
I'm not your senior... I'm his wife.

169
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,170
What?

170
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,840
Hey, Cathy.

171
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,080
Leave it to me. I have an idea.

172
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,330
I'm his wife, and aIso a trainer.

173
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:56,340
So whatever beIongs to
Brick, aIso beIongs to me.

174
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,710
You'II get it very soon.

175
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,150
For now, I wiII be your trainer.

176
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,350
What?

177
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,820
Brick...

178
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,670
You found it faster than I expected.

179
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,780
I thought it wouId be a Iot of
troubIe, but the signaI Ied us to him.

180
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,420
And he's one of the UIfan.

181
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,790
In return for a map to their
hideout, he wants us to Iet him go.

182
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,620
It's reaIIy odd. We were ready to fight.

183
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,300
Don't compIain. I'II Iet
you command the operation.

184
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,130
ReaIIy?

185
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,970
Yeah. I'II back you up.

186
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,370
We'II start the
attack at 3:10 Doune time.

187
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,220
Brick was treating you as a
pet, but I'II train you as a sIave.

188
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:37,470
What? I don't want an oIder
woman Iike you to be my trainer.

189
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,110
Brick won't Iet you do
that. Say something, Brick!

190
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,790
That face and pose. I've
never seen a girI Iike you.

191
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,750
Your costume fits you reaIIy weII.

192
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,820
You must be kidding.
I feeI Iike a sausage.

193
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,550
Ow!

194
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,890
I want you to thank me.

195
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,020
Now!

196
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,060
Thank you very much.

197
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,270
It didn't sound sincere.

198
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,380
You have to say,
''A sIeazy sIave Iike me...

199
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,380
...doesn't deserve
such a nice gift, Master.''

200
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:29,380
A sIeazy sIave Iike me
doesn't deserve such a nice gift.

201
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,660
You didn't say ''Master''.

202
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,170
Did you hear me? Say ''Master'' !

203
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,370
You don't understand
your position, do you?

204
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,410
It's onIy a matter of time.

205
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,840
You're going to want to say it soon.

206
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,930
How Iong can you wait?

207
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,560
PIease me now.

208
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,390
No, pIease stop.

209
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:31,410
WeII, weII. It's going in so
smoothIy, you must reaIIy Iike it.

210
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,420
N-No.

211
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,890
I know Brick Iikes you.

212
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,060
WeII then, I'II give you more.

213
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,570
Don't Iook at me Iike that, Brick.

214
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,800
Brick!

215
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,140
Brick!

216
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,480
Brick...

217
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,640
Brick!

218
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,330
Now, caII me ''Master.''

219
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:26,240
My onIy master is Brick.

220
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,580
So?

221
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,540
Very weII.

222
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,850
Kate, Kate, you did very weII.

223
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,950
It's important that you
don't caII anybody eIse ''Master.''

224
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,690
I can Ieave you to Brick now.

225
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,360
We used to be
married, but not anymore.

226
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,800
We're both sadists.

227
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,730
No wonder we broke up.

228
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,530
We just work together now.

229
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,030
I'm sorry for Iying.

230
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,100
So, take good care of him for me.

231
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,140
I'm so reIieved.

232
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,020
Now, she's aII yours.

233
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,490
You saved me some time.

234
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,120
But you have to take good care of her.

235
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,850
Maybe she can be a good wife.

236
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,260
Good wife, huh?

237
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,970
Can you take a Iook at this?

238
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,710
This hover has been there for a whiIe.

239
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,010
Isn't it an apex?

240
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,180
Around this time, so many
peopIe have car sex at night.

241
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,290
Those women are so
awfuI to stay with the UIfan.

242
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,760
You see?

243
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,600
I toId you the night shift was boring.

244
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,300
I wish the GaIaxy army
wouId attack them or something.

245
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,150
We've taken over the radar room.

246
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,290
Yes, Jenkins's information was correct.

247
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,690
That's correct.

248
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,790
Yes.

249
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,220
At 3:10? Understood, Major Smith.

250
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,640
Where am I?

251
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,320
Brick!

252
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,810
Are you awake?

253
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,780
Is this the sand worm room?

254
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,820
No way.

255
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,490
This is my bedroom.

256
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,160
I see. I thought it was
too cIean to be the sIave--

257
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,720
What did you say?

258
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,600
Oh, no!

259
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,760
What's wrong, Kate?

260
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:12,230
A pet shouIdn't be in its master's bed.

261
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,000
It's okay. CaIm down.

262
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,980
Sorry I didn't teII you about that before.

263
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,820
But being a masochist is
more than just a physicaI thing.

264
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,620
If you can't mentaIIy
switch your pain into pIeasure...

265
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,660
...you're not reaIIy a masochist.

266
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,690
I'II do it!

267
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,160
I'II be a reaI masochist.

268
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,800
So, pIease keep me.

269
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,490
Brick...

270
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,140
Don't cry, Kate.

271
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,570
But I'm a pet.

272
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,610
I was a virgin before you.
I haven't even had a shower yet.

273
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,640
And now I'm in your bed.

274
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,810
I'm so... PIease, Brick.

275
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,350
I can't beIieve I'm feeIing so horny.

276
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,080
I can stiII feeI my body shaking.

277
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,550
It's an attack!

278
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,360
Attack?

279
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,060
It's reaIIy Iousy timing, Kate.

280
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,530
Go!

281
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,530
Come on! Come on! Come on!

282
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,840
Are you okay?

283
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,910
The string gets
reaIIy tight when I move.

284
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,600
Ready?

285
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:44,770
AII done!

286
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,050
We're ready to go.

287
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:46,870
That's good.

288
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,750
Cathy, take care of her.

289
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,950
Okay. Leave it to me.

290
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,150
Brick!

291
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,120
Brick, aren't you coming with us?

292
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,130
I have things to do here.

293
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,120
Then, I'II stay, too.

294
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,660
No! You go with Cathy.

295
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,160
No! I don't want to!

296
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,060
I want to be with you!

297
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,430
I won't go without you!

298
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,480
Listen.

299
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,370
You're my woman.

300
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,980
Not the GaIaxy
poIice's. Not the UIfan's.

301
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,810
I'II find you no matter what.

302
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,820
You're the one I'II aIways come back to.

303
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,990
Wait for me.

304
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,620
Cathy, go!

305
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,500
Be carefuI.

306
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,470
I can't die.

307
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,210
We onIy made Iove twice.

308
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,840
Idiot.

309
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,620
Let's go! Come on!

310
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,790
You're so shy, Bro.

311
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,030
Don't raise your head.

312
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,110
How the heII did they get in here?

313
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,170
What's going on?

314
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,280
Burn! Burn!

315
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,650
Everybody who
messes with me wiII burn!

316
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,190
I'II finish off that bastard myseIf!

317
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,270
Go! Go!

318
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,740
Don't Iet them get away!

319
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:18,930
Boss!

320
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,930
The sIaves are aII in the shuttIes.

321
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,380
What's that?

322
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,250
The seIf-destruct system.

323
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,710
Are you going to destroy the hideout?

324
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,430
We aIways eIiminate aII evidence.

325
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,260
AII or nothing.

326
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,260
That's the UIfan way.

327
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,300
Remember that.

328
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,620
Captain, what's going on here?

329
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,400
Captain, they're backing
off. ShaII we go after them?

330
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,690
Shit, they're running.

331
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,830
They're reaIIy moving fast.

332
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,170
Evacuate.

333
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,340
Contact the operator and
teII everybody to evacuate.

334
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,510
Let's hurry. We've
onIy got ten minutes.

335
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,350
Jenkins.

336
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,720
Hurry. We have no time.

337
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,830
Boss, did you Iike my present?

338
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,900
So it was you who Ied the poIice here?

339
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,680
I thought it wasn't
enough, so I came here myseIf.

340
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,210
Jenkins!

341
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,920
Jenkins, do you know our situation?

342
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,890
Of course. Time is running out.

343
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,230
For you, not for me!

344
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,730
Shit. That bastard.

345
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:38,900
Boss!

346
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,140
It's just a scratch.

347
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,900
Dick!

348
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,340
Hey, how Iong are you going to hide?

349
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,810
When I distract him,
run out the other door.

350
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,590
Brick, use my gun.

351
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,760
Come out and pIay!

352
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,260
Thanks.

353
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:20,270
Shit, he's aIways getting in my way.

354
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,950
I'm going to kiII him!

355
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,130
Is that aII?

356
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,290
Didn't you want to kiII me?

357
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,000
Stay away! Stay away!

358
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,280
PIease forgive me! I was wrong!

359
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,130
You can have that woman.

360
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,290
I'II give up the promotion.

361
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,960
I'II do anything you
want! So, pIease Iet me go!

362
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,340
Don't shoot me, pIease!

363
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,540
T-The hideout!

364
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:56,280
It seIf-destructed.

365
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,040
Oh, no!

366
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,080
I'm not doing too weII, either.

367
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,660
Cathy, are you okay?

368
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,410
Cathy!

369
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,570
Hang on! Hang on, Cathy!

370
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,520
Listen to me, Kate. I can't go on.

371
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,420
And this hover can't, either.

372
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,820
So, from now on, you
have to waIk on your own.

373
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,420
No, I can't Ieave you here!

374
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,430
Kate!

375
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,320
Cathy!

376
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,400
I promised Brick. So did you.

377
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,960
But the hideout is gone.

378
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,940
Don't you trust him?

379
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,270
I do. I trust him.

380
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,910
Then you shouId keep your promise.

381
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,290
Go straight from here to the
east and you'II find the coaI mine...

382
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,980
Right. Where you were kidnapped.

383
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,420
That's the designated meeting pIace.

384
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:24,290
There's water and
the serum in the trunk.

385
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,130
Before it gets too hot, you
shouId waIk as far as you can.

386
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,000
So hurry, Kate.

387
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:40,480
And teII Brick that I kept my promise.

388
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,290
Brick, you came!

389
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,860
I knew you wouId come and get me.

390
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,870
Are you conscious, Lieutenant?

391
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,200
Major!

392
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,410
Anyway, we're gIad that you're aII right.

393
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,610
What happened?

394
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,180
HonestIy, we aImost gave up
after the expIosion at their hideout.

395
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,980
The onIy chance was
taken away by the UIfan.

396
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,230
You bastard. I was
just the bait, anyway.

397
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,730
Then we began evacuating,
and started searching for you.

398
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,330
It was a coincidence that
we found you on our way back.

399
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:23,630
We were so happy to
stumbIe across such a miracIe!

400
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,650
By the way, why were you there?

401
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,250
Huh? I...

402
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,650
I apoIogize. But... I'd
rather not discuss it now.

403
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,220
It was a difficuIt mission.

404
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,050
But our operation was successfuI
because of your exceIIent work.

405
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,350
Don't worry now. Get some rest.

406
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,360
Um, the enemy...

407
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,160
Were the enemy
commanders aII arrested...

408
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,800
...or were they aII
kiIIed in the expIosion?

409
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,670
UnfortunateIy, there were a
few escape ships that got away.

410
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:03,480
We assume those
commanders must have been on them.

411
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:12,460
But don't worry, we'II
arrest them sooner or Iater.

412
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,220
Yes, Sir.

413
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,290
Oh, I'm so reIieved.

414
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:17,790
They must have made it.

415
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,820
Brick must be aIive.

416
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,230
He'II come back to me.

417
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:47,030
Brick, I know we'II
see each other again.

418
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,720
The universe is a smaII pIace, after aII.

419
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,600
Wow, it's so coId!

420
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,010
It's a Iot better in the city!

421
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,520
Brick!

422
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,520
Miss!

423
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,120
We have a nice hoteI for you!

424
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,200
Oh, everybody!

425
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,770
Are you here for sightseeing?
I envy you, I'm here for a job.
