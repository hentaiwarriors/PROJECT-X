1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,050
Before the beginning...

2
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,670
...there was no light or shadow...

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,200
...even time didn't exist.

4
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,410
In the beginning of everything...

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,000
...there was chaos.

6
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,840
Lord Zeus?

7
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,870
Lord Zeus?

8
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,780
Lord Zeus?

9
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,390
That Hera...

10
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,520
She slapped me really hard... Does she want to kill me?

11
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,220
Aww, you got a big booboo, poor Zeu-chu.

12
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,430
I was so close...

13
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,800
Fella caught you cheating again?

14
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,640
Oshime, how many times do I have to tell you?

15
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,840
Her name is Hera, not Fella.

16
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,400
I don't even want to mention her name right now...

17
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,920
You should stop having affairs in Heaven.

18
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,710
You're always using your divine powers to hit on angels...

19
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,410
...of course Fella will find out...

20
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,050
You shut your mouth!

21
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,700
How can I get close to young, sexy angels and...

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,560
...do all sorts of naughty things without Hera finding out?

23
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,230
Oh, I want to do it! I want to do it!

24
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,570
I want to do it with young angels!

25
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,540
I want to do it!

26
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,010
L-Lord Zeus, you might want to keep your voice down.

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,240
Everyone in Heaven will hear you.

28
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,580
Oh, it's the Chief Angel.

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,160
I've been looking all over Heaven for you.

30
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,990
This is a divine palace...

31
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,560
...you should watch your mouth and try to behave yourself.

32
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,460
Shut up!

33
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
Lord Zeus!

34
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,330
Are you going to treat me like an idiot, too?

35
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,160
So, what do you want?

36
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,340
Well, it's almost time, so...

37
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,700
For what?

38
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,100
H-Have you forgotten?

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,270
Today is the day of the angels' yearly promotional examination.

40
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,350
You guys go ahead. I'm busy right now.

41
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,650
Count me out.

42
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,920
Unacceptable!

43
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,850
The future of young angels depends on this test.

44
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,590
Do you understand your position as King of the Gods?

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,290
Okay, okay, I understand.

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,460
I'm tired of listening to your lectures.

47
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,800
Very well.

48
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,870
The angels who will be taking the test for...

49
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,110
...B-Class angel are, Hesperis, Euproshne, and Aurora.

50
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,140
Hesperis, Euproshne, and Aurora?

51
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,120
Those three...

52
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,420
As you know, the test will be to see how many humans they can help on Earth.

53
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,960
Their final score will be judged on virtue, generosity, courage, and intelligence.

54
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,630
We'll rank each category from A to D.

55
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,630
On Earth?

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,330
They have three months.

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,030
During that time, they have to...

58
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,400
I see!

59
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,210
Um, Lord Zeus?

60
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,940
Get out of my way!

61
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,730
Out of his way!

62
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,330
I'm just here to deliver a package...

63
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,000
Can it!

64
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,440
I'm sorry!

65
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,870
Come on, can you guys just leave for today?

66
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,820
What do you care? You have no customers in here.

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,390
No customers at all!

68
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,460
That's because you guys are here!

69
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,620
Hey now, don't try to blame it on us.

70
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,950
What?

71
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,360
It's not our fault that you can't sell any flowers.

72
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,490
You...

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,470
Hey now...

74
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,700
I don't approve of violence.

75
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,670
Me neither.

76
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,630
We could help you with closing the store if you want.

77
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,240
Why you...

78
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,140
Could I have some flowers, please?

79
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,720
I'd like these freesia too.

80
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,050
I want this lily!

81
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,180
Uh, yes.

82
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,620
In a minute.

83
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,490
Who the hell are you?

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,190
Will you move? You're blocking the flowers.

85
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,200
What?

86
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,700
You're scaring the flowers with that face of yours.

87
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,170
Yes, he is.

88
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,710
You had better stay out of it!

89
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,910
Why you...

90
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,410
And what if we don't?

91
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,820
Bitch!

92
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,560
That's enough!

93
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,750
If you're going to keep causing trouble, I'll call the cops!

94
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,990
You'll pay for this!

95
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,930
You will!

96
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,430
Will you take a rain check?

97
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,700
Land speculators?

98
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,240
Yeah.

99
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,570
After my grandma died, I've been taking care of the flower shop by myself...

100
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,280
...but recently those guys have been trying to close this store.

101
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,780
That's terrible!

102
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,440
They are such meanies!

103
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,550
But I will protect this shop from them, no matter what!

104
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,050
We will help you.

105
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,960
We will make this shop thrive!

106
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,690
Leave everything to us!

107
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,370
But why?

108
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,400
Because that's our test...

109
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,510
...I mean, our mission!

110
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,110
But we have one favor to ask you...

111
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,480
Can we live with you?

112
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,140
Live with me?

113
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,520
We haven't found a place to live yet, so...

114
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,460
Well, I guess it's okay...

115
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,790
Great!

116
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,300
We don't have to sleep outside.

117
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,990
This must be a divine blessing...

118
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,500
Excuse me...

119
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,360
Yes?

120
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,970
Welcome! How may I help you?

121
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,810
Well, I'm not a customer.

122
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,270
I just want to get a signature for this package.

123
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,050
My human name is Yuu Amamiya. My angel name is Hesperis.

124
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,060
Her human name is Miki Yuunaki. Her angel name is Euproshne.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,490
And her human name is Chadoko Asagiri. Her angel name is Aurora.

126
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,600
Actually, we are angels, sent to earth take the examination for promotion.

127
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,110
Listen carefully...

128
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,120
You must make as many humans happy as you possibly can.

129
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,850
That's the task for the test.

130
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,120
But you cannot let anyone know that you are angels.

131
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,860
You are not to use any angelic powers, either.

132
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:30,130
Many hardships await you, but don't let that get you down, and do your best!

133
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,940
We know you can pass this test!

134
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,130
Yes!

135
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,450
Are these all the flowers to deliver?

136
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,090
Yeah, but is it really okay to ask you to do this?

137
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,060
There is no need to worry!

138
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,130
You can count on us!

139
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,530
That's right. This shop will be flooded with customers in no time!

140
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,140
Well, I'm not going to get my hopes too high...

141
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,130
That's not a very nice thing to say. Don't you trust my sense of art?

142
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,540
Well, we're off to make our deliveries.

143
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,310
Be careful, Yuu!

144
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,780
I'll see you later, Miki.

145
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,850
Where are you going, Miki?

146
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,790
I'm teaching a swimming lesson.

147
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,510
Well, well...

148
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,650
Hi, I met you at the store yesterday.

149
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,020
Oh, you are...

150
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,090
...excuse me, but have we met?

151
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,920
I delivered a package to the flower shop yesterday...

152
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,120
Oh right. You're the delivery man.

153
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,160
So, do you work here?

154
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,090
Yes, I just started today.

155
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,300
Do you work here too?

156
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,370
Yes. I work a few part-time jobs.

157
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,910
I'm Yorishiro.

158
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,940
I'm Miki Yuunaki. You can call me Miki.

159
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,910
Yes, Miki.

160
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,930
Okay everyone, we are going to do some stretching in the water first.

161
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,930
Move your body just like I do in the pool.

162
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,430
Now...

163
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,500
One, two, one, two...

164
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,200
One, two...

165
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,970
Next, stretch your side.

166
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,070
One, two...

167
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,680
One, two...

168
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,180
And the other side...

169
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,310
<i>W-What am I looking at?</i>

170
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,180
<i>I'm working right now...</i>

171
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,800
Yorishiro!

172
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,630
Are you okay?

173
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,940
Come on, grab my hand.

174
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,940
Um, I can't right now.

175
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,070
Huh?

176
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,950
Well, my lower body is...

177
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,110
Does it hurt?

178
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,150
No, it doesn't hurt, but...

179
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,950
Go on, grab my hand.

180
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,450
O-Okay...

181
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,200
<i>Oh no! This time I really got a cramp!</i>

182
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,370
Is something wrong?

183
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,300
M-My leg...

184
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,620
Yorishiro?

185
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,990
Yorishiro?

186
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,630
<i>What should I do?</i>

187
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,500
<i>He isn't breathing, I have to do something...</i>

188
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,230
Oh my...

189
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,340
Well, excuse me.

190
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,880
<i>What's this?</i>

191
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,420
<i>What is this soft feeling?</i>

192
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,530
<i>M-Miki!</i>

193
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,040
<i>Ooh, I'm the luckiest man on Earth!</i>

194
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,050
<i>Her lips are so soft...</i>

195
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,960
That's right. Keep doing that.

196
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,740
It feels great.

197
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,670
What?

198
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,450
<i>What was that? I just felt something really hot inside my body...</i>

199
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,620
That's right...

200
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,550
What?

201
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,090
Go on.

202
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,560
Yes.

203
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,860
<i>Oh, it feels good...</i>

204
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,300
<i>My goodness, what am I doing?</i>

205
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,740
<i>But my body is so hot...</i>

206
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:19,080
<i>This must be the test Lord Zeus was talking about.</i>

207
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,910
Now, kiss me.

208
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,030
Kiss?

209
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,130
That's right, kiss me.

210
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,090
Yes...

211
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,770
Huh?

212
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,610
Miki?

213
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,780
Are you feeling okay now?

214
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,110
This is so boring.

215
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,110
There are no customers...

216
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,680
I arranged those bouquets with all my love, but there's no one to buy...

217
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,620
Those are the thugs from the other day!

218
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,190
Those are precious flowers!

219
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,730
You came out of nowhere!

220
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,000
You did!

221
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,040
What are you talking about? You jumped right in front of me!

222
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,230
I could take you to the police if that's what you want.

223
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,140
Or if you sold the shop to us right now, we would forget about this.

224
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,150
It's you again!

225
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,650
You had better give it up already, or I will have to teach you a lesson again...

226
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,150
Yes, he will!

227
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,120
Hey stop it!

228
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,130
You should not step on the flowers.

229
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,100
What's that?

230
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,640
Get lost!

231
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,980
E-Excuse me...

232
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,140
Thank you so much.

233
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,390
Can I see some flowers?

234
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,850
Yes, of course.

235
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,650
Minori, we've got a customer.

236
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,330
What a beautiful rose...

237
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:21,330
My late grandma took great care to grow those roses.

238
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,670
I'll take a dozen.

239
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,600
Thank you very much.

240
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,670
And that bouquet.

241
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,240
Huh? But this is...

242
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,710
Just throw it in.

243
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,680
Oh, thank you so much!

244
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,220
Thanks for your help.

245
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,110
Thank you, come again!

246
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,530
What a generous customer...

247
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,060
See? He totally understood my taste!

248
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,230
I wonder...

249
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,620
Wake up, my little angels.

250
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,230
Lord Zeus?

251
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,190
Lord Zeus?

252
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,170
I'm speaking to you from Pantheon Palace.

253
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,330
I understand, Lord.

254
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,600
Will you wake Chadoko up please?

255
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,670
Chadoko! Wake up!

256
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,700
Hmm? Is it morning already?

257
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,140
No. Lord Zeus is here to talk to us.

258
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,650
Really?

259
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,580
Everyone, just relax and listen.

260
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,020
As you all know the test has already begun.

261
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,020
So, how did you do, Miki?

262
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,220
Well, I think I made someone happy.

263
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,090
What about you, Chadoko?

264
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,330
Yes! I did a good job!

265
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,660
Oh really?

266
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,330
And Yuu?

267
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,130
I failed miserably.

268
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,930
But it was because of those men!

269
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,610
Yuu, you cannot blame others for your mistakes.

270
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,150
Yes, Lord Zeus.

271
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,590
If you are to improve your efforts, you must blame no one but yourself.

272
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,790
Yes...

273
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,330
Don't let this get to you, Yuu. There are still plenty of chances.

274
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,560
I'll look forward to tomorrow!

275
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,790
Good luck!

276
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:45,660
SPECIAL EFFECTS HERO SHOW
BEAST WARRIORS
BIKI ANIMAL SHOW

277
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,610
I'm going to do my best and make up for lost time tomorrow.

278
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,280
I can't lose to Chado and Miki either...

279
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,690
Let me zip up and...

280
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,180
Ooh, this costume is really tight.

281
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,700
It's wedged in around my sensitive area...

282
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,870
Here I am! I'm Biki Panther!

283
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,570
Do I look cool, or what?

284
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,910
What's happening to me?

285
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,580
My body is getting hot...

286
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,650
Not only that...

287
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,960
...it feels like my body has become more sensitive.

288
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,750
Warriors of Justice!

289
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:52,980
We're the animal warriors!

290
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,780
Biki Animals!

291
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,830
Good show.

292
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,800
It was a great show!

293
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,730
Yuu, you were really great.

294
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,230
Thank you.

295
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,110
<i>I'm wet... What's wrong with me?</i>

296
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,510
No, I can't. I shouldn't do such a thing...

297
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,620
Y-Yes?

298
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,860
Yuu, can I come in?

299
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,990
Yeah, sure.

300
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,130
Yuu...

301
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,260
Are you feeling all right?

302
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,100
Yes, I'm fine.

303
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,630
Good...

304
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,410
You'll feel better if I do this...

305
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,520
What?

306
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,980
You're so beautiful

307
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,920
No, it's embarrassing!

308
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,690
Stop it, Yorishiro...

309
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,020
<i>I don't know what's going on...</i>

310
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,460
<i>...but I can't resist it.</i>

311
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,900
<i>Besides... it feels good...</i>

312
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,240
Yuu...

313
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,900
Suck this.

314
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,140
It will make me feel really good...

315
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,160
<i>Oh, it feels good...</i>

316
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,170
<i>This must be the test Lord Zeus was talking about...</i>

317
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,680
It feels great, Yuu...

318
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,050
Yuu...

319
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,830
I'll put it in.

320
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:43,320
<i>Lord Zeus, is this also part of the test?</i>

321
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,820
<i>Oh, it feels great! I can't hold back...</i>

322
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,560
What the...

323
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,040
It's a Sex Beast!

324
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,170
Why is it here?

325
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,820
Yuu!

326
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,790
Damn it, if I use any more godly powers, Hera will find out about me...

327
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,690
I have no choice!

328
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,340
Yorishiro!

329
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,670
Come on, you monster! I will fight you!

330
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,240
Take this! And this! And this!

331
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,320
And this!

332
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,760
Take this! And this! And this!

333
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,590
I'm not going to lose!

334
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,320
You're not going to beat me!

335
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:07,800
Take this! And this! And this!

336
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,270
Eat this!

337
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,620
Yorishiro, are you okay?

338
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,520
I defeated the monster!

339
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,890
Yuu...

340
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,690
I did it! I did it!

341
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,600
Hey, Yuu...

342
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,700
What was I doing?

343
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,840
Zeu-chu!

344
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,340
Zeu-chu!

345
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,970
Are you sure about that?

346
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,090
Yes. I saw it with my own eyes.

347
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,410
But I don't understand...

348
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,480
Are they trying to invade Hell?

349
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,740
Persephone, go to the surface and find out what his real purpose is.

350
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,120
And if those angels get in your way, eliminate them.

351
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,590
Okay!
