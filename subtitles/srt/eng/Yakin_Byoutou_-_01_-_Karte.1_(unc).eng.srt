1
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:17,415
How could this have happened?!

2
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:27,930
That day, I truly understood
what my desires were.

3
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:31,433
That day, I enslaved a woman.

4
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:37,104
That day, I acquired the best
specimen I could for my experiments.

5
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:38,872
So I thought...

6
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:59,124
Tomorrow I start my new job
at St. Juliana Hospital.

7
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,093
Of course, it's only a temporary
assignment lasting a month.

8
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:06,002
According to the medical association
that gave me the introduction...

9
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,167
it was a request made
directly by the chief medical officer.

10
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:12,645
But, why was I chosen?

11
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:19,447
Why? Considering that I haven't
practiced medicine in ten years.

12
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:22,187
Well, it doesn't matter
what the reason is.

13
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:27,953
After all, I'm just trying
to make my rent payment this month.

14
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,704
It looks like
I'm just a bit early.

15
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:08,587
Use those supple fingers
and work my...

16
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,328
Um, is something the matter?

17
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:19,637
Oh, uh, well... Let's see...

18
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:23,072
Oh, do you like flowers?

19
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:25,173
Yes.

20
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:27,146
Aren't they beautiful?

21
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:30,784
They let me take care of
this flower garden.

22
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:33,886
When I get a little break
from work...

23
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:36,479
I get permission from
the chief nurse.

24
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:50,201
Um, do you want
something from me?

25
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:51,931
Oh, uh...

26
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:56,066
Well, actually,
I start work here today.

27
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:58,941
But it's only a one month
assignment. Still, it's a good job.

28
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:01,071
Oh, then you must be a doctor.

29
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:04,417
Uh, right. I'm looking for
the chief medical officer.

30
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,282
Right. I'll show you the way.

31
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:08,252
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

32
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:09,721
Please. Come this way.

33
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:11,052
Thank you very much.

34
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:39,980
It's this way.

35
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:42,216
Right.

36
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,919
Hold it, you!

37
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:53,366
What is your specialty,
Doctor?

38
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:55,129
Gynecology.

39
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:57,932
I'll probably get assigned
to gynecology.

40
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:01,707
What a coincidence!
I'm in gynecology as well.

41
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:05,636
Oh. Well, my name is
Ryuji Hirasaka. What's yours?

42
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:09,045
I'm Ren Nanase.
Ren is Chinese for "love".

43
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,845
What a pretty name.

44
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,518
Thank you.

45
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,658
The chief medical officer's
office is here.

46
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:23,127
Thanks.
Sorry for all the trouble.

47
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:24,664
Not at all.

48
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,736
I suppose
we'll be working together.

49
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,362
It was a pleasure to meet you.

50
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:34,775
Likewise, I'm sure.

51
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,736
Um, I'd like to
give this to you.

52
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:42,946
A token of our acquaintance.

53
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,416
It's really not much, though.

54
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:50,823
Well, I must be on my way.

55
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:06,272
It's open. Come right in.

56
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,877
Excuse me.

57
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:13,538
Pleased to meet you.

58
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:15,972
I was referred by
the medical association...

59
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,018
I know. You're
Ryuji Hirasaka, right?

60
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,087
Huh?

61
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:24,052
Top of the class at a
national medical school...

62
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:28,561
a doctor with a bright future
engaged in interesting research.

63
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:33,496
However, one day
ten years ago...

64
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,229
you suddenly disappeared
from the university hospital...

65
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:39,067
never to be seen or
heard from again.

66
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,501
Isn't that right?

67
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,575
Uh, yes.

68
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:45,277
How?!

69
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,639
How much more does she know?!

70
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:54,518
You see. I've been looking
for you all this time.

71
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,453
Excuse me,
but what is this about?

72
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,224
Don't you remember me?

73
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:04,094
Narumi?!

74
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,861
But how could this be?!

75
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:09,836
Yes. I'm Narumi Jinguji.

76
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:11,637
Wh-What is this about?!

77
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,872
I can't blame you
for being so shaken.

78
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:19,638
Actually, there's a reason
why I've been looking for you.

79
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:23,072
Are you planning on revenge?!

80
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:26,016
Come on.
No need to get all stiff.

81
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,144
Take a look at this.

82
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:34,127
For a municipal general hospital,
we've been quite successful.

83
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:38,825
However, I'm a woman who's
not satisfied with just that.

84
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,424
The fact of the matter is...

85
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:44,436
I have a plan that'll help
expand this hospital.

86
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:48,073
I want to build a special ward.

87
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:50,133
Special ward?

88
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:51,945
That's right.

89
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:53,408
In our special ward...

90
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:58,213
we will accept only male patients
of a certain stature and influence.

91
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,116
So, is that all
you had in mind?

92
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:02,815
You see, other hospitals
are doing it too.

93
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:06,415
But the job requirements of
the nurses are completely different.

94
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,753
Job requirements?

95
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,194
Special requirements.

96
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:15,293
In other words, perfect sex
slaves who will submit to every...

97
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:19,499
whim and sexual desire
of the paying male patients.

98
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,407
Really. Just think about it.

99
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:25,945
All those educated little
bitches in heat...

100
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,572
waiting with
their tails wagging.

101
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:31,549
I'm sure everyone will want
to become a patient.

102
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:33,677
I see.

103
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:36,848
I understand clearly your
reason for searching me out.

104
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:40,087
So, you want me to take
those novice nurses...

105
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:42,890
who are naive and
innocent about the world...

106
00:08:42,997 --> 00:08:44,828
and turn them into sex
slaves, right?

107
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:46,160
Yes.

108
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:48,126
It's your specialty,
isn't it?

109
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,666
As a reward for your
services...

110
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:54,707
you can expect to be the
director of this special ward.

111
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,078
But, I'd sure like a contract.

112
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,238
Don't be ridiculous!

113
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:04,715
I'm not so foolish as to
leave a paper trail!

114
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:07,413
Well, there's no need to
put it on paper exactly.

115
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,121
Since I'm not sure
that I can trust you...

116
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:12,692
perhaps you can prove it
with the right gesture.

117
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,229
We are going to be criminal
accomplices, right?

118
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:21,768
Don't you think it's important
that we have a trusting relationship?

119
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:25,298
Sure.

120
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:40,636
No!

121
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:46,878
You touch this body only
after our total success.

122
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:45,574
I can't be seen with you
regularly...

123
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:47,874
so I'll be sending you
details on candidates by e-mail.

124
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:51,983
Stop in to see me in person
once a week.

125
00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:54,150
I pray for your success.

126
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,749
Candidate 1

127
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,328
Ren Nanase

128
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:05,321
This one...
She looks perfect.

129
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:13,133
302: Naoya Ohkawa
She seems to find something
interesting in Room 302?

130
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:17,674
Don't worry.
I can do the rest.

131
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,769
No. You mustn't push it.

132
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,781
Sorry.
But don't worry about me.

133
00:12:22,883 --> 00:12:24,578
Now, don't you have to
get back to work?

134
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:25,652
But...

135
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:28,881
What's she getting so
familiar with him for?

136
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:39,125
When I become world
champion, I'll definitely...

137
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:43,570
Damn! So, that's
what it was about!

138
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:47,136
And there she was
acting so innocent!

139
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:52,170
Miss Nanase of gynecology,
there are people here for you.

140
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,510
Please report to the front
entrance immediately.

141
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,219
Hey, lady.
Where are you taking us?

142
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,514
Just show us the money.

143
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:05,457
Please don't ever come to
the hospital again.

144
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,119
You're a strange bird.

145
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:12,187
Putting up your own money
for a guy you don't even know.

146
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:14,825
It's all too bad.

147
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:16,266
A professional boxer...

148
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,203
last year's Golden Boy
getting into a fight like that.

149
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:22,867
But you've got to hand it to
that Naoya Ohkawa, the Golden Boy.

150
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:26,571
He did break your
brother's jaw, after all.

151
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,411
Well, it's a pretty good deal
for medical fees and shush money.

152
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:32,144
Please leave right away.

153
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:34,152
I don't want to be seen by...

154
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,154
All right. All right.

155
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:39,521
Right. So, we'll
see you next month.

156
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:48,928
How admirable of her.

157
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:53,132
I see. So Naoya's
the Golden Boy of boxing, huh?

158
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:58,208
A special article:
Naoya Ohkawa

159
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:04,116
Doctor?
I believe you called?

160
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:07,747
Right. Come on in.

161
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:13,987
Thanks for coming.

162
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:17,487
What can I help you with?

163
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,258
Right. So could you come
over this way for a second?

164
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:26,339
Um...?

165
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,000
There's a problem with the
examination chair.

166
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:31,337
Would you get on
and try it out for me?

167
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:32,605
Try it out?

168
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,011
I want you to take your
panties off and sit in the chair.

169
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:44,486
I'm going home.

170
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:52,788
I read that boxing is nothing
short of a life mission...

171
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,233
for the Golden Boy of boxing,
Naoya Ohkawa.

172
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:59,570
That's what he says
in the interview.

173
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:01,641
A childhood dream.

174
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:05,007
To become the world champion.
How noble, don't you think?

175
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:07,239
Wh-What are you
talking about?

176
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,279
Keep your mouth shut!

177
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,545
Wouldn't it be a problem
if someone came?

178
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:15,622
What are you
talking about?! Then...

179
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:19,419
Aren't you the one who'd be
in bigger trouble if someone came by?

180
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:21,323
Well now, isn't that right?

181
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:23,623
The Golden Boy seeking
the world championship...

182
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,322
getting hit
with assault charges.

183
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:29,493
- How do you know that?!
- That would be quite a scandal.

184
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:31,298
He'd probably have to retire.

185
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:33,798
R-Retire?!

186
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:37,808
He might even have to go to jail.

187
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:41,677
They do consider a boxer's
punch a deadly weapon, you know.

188
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:42,976
P-Please stop!

189
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,244
Naoya was just trying to
protect me...!

190
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:47,445
- Oh, I see.
- I beg you!

191
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:49,749
Please don't
tell anyone about this!

192
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,752
Sure. I'll keep quiet.

193
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:57,755
No!

194
00:15:58,198 --> 00:15:59,927
Oh? Is that so?

195
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,462
I'm sure the tabloids would
have a field day with this.

196
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:08,063
A big scoop for them.

197
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,437
Please stop!

198
00:16:09,543 --> 00:16:12,569
Then, you know
what you have to do.

199
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,007
I don't know!

200
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:17,106
You don't care what happens
to Naoya then?

201
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:34,730
Well, they sure are
nice and firm.

202
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,430
Doctor! Please don't...!

203
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:46,702
Look at these pointy nipples!
Have you been masturbating?

204
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:48,781
No!

205
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:00,150
Ow! Please stop!

206
00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:03,589
Now you are mine.

207
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:07,360
You've now been branded
with my mark of medical distinction.

208
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,799
Please, let me go...!

209
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:26,848
You're all wet.

210
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:37,427
You've got an erogenous zone
in an interesting place.

211
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:40,124
Please, Doctor...!

212
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:43,602
Please, I beg you...!

213
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,369
Stop! I beg you!

214
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:55,380
No! No!

215
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,186
It looks like you're really wet.

216
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,875
Please! No!

217
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,083
Please! I beg you!

218
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:35,679
Naoya!

219
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,393
Naoya! Naoya!

220
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:40,678
So, you were a virgin!

221
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:44,751
You are definitely mine now!

222
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:56,091
Naoya...!

223
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:13,777
Naoya.

224
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,582
What is it, Ren?

225
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,787
Yesterday, I...

226
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:20,985
Miss Ren,
taking him out for a walk?

227
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,656
Doctor.

228
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,529
Nice to meet you.
I'm Ryuji Hirasaka.

229
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,762
I work in the same
gynecology department as Ren.

230
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:33,766
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm Naoya Ohkawa.

231
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:39,067
I hear that you're the
Golden Boy of boxing.

232
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,306
I'm going after
the world championship.

233
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,416
That's great.

234
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:46,486
Then this must be a most
crucial time for you.

235
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:48,645
Yes. I think so.

236
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,192
Um, I...

237
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:56,928
I have something
to take care of.

238
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:00,560
- I wonder what's the matter.
- Who knows.

239
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:02,696
I really don't...

240
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,237
Come on, now.
Just get undressed.

241
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:06,362
But...

242
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:07,866
Let's see.

243
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:12,308
I'm going to see if what
I suspect to be true is true.

244
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,040
Please stop.

245
00:21:16,082 --> 00:21:19,142
Now, relax your muscles.

246
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:25,488
Well, well. It seems that
you were lying before.

247
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,694
Your uterus is
as wet as can be.

248
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:33,527
I guess you much rather
prefer the anus, after all.

249
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:35,066
Wh-What are you going to...?

250
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:46,407
Naoya!

251
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,149
Just watch, Naoya.

252
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,117
Watch my woman
writhe in ecstasy!

253
00:21:54,154 --> 00:21:55,781
Watch, Naoya!

254
00:21:55,889 --> 00:22:00,019
She's learned true carnal pleasure
after being fucked by me!

255
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,059
Don't look!

256
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:05,257
N-No!

257
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,060
Naoya!

258
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,608
Doctor...!

259
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:24,982
Doctor, yes...

260
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:54,296
Candidate 2

261
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:58,366
Remi Shinjyo
