1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,862
<i>I barely remember the</i>
<i>joyful days of the past...</i>

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,768
<i>...that I spent wlth my mother.</i>

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,674
<i>After my mother's death...</i>

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,575
<i>...I was put into a convent.</i>

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,312
<i>There I spent day after day...</i>

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>...doing disgusting and</i>
<i>degrading things for no reason.</i>

7
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,151
<i>However, I made friends...</i>

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,745
<i>...who were very kind to me</i>
<i>during those troubling times.</i>

9
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,151
<i>Beth...</i>

10
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,188
<i>...and Andrew, the love of my life.</i>

11
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:29,426
<i>Then one day, a man unexpectedly</i>
<i>arrived to take me away to his home.</i>

12
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,927
<i>Duke Dusse, my mother's younger brother.</i>

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,098
<i>It was delightful to meet a living relative...</i>

14
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,161
<i>...and I decided to take his</i>
<i>lessons and become a Love Doll...</i>

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,072
<i>...the flower of high society.</i>

16
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:43,642
<i>But...</i>

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,613
<i>...I was forced to endure</i>
<i>unimaginable lessons in sex.</i>

18
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,440
<i>In town one day...</i>

19
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,246
<i>...by chance...</i>

20
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,980
<i>...I happened to see Andrew and</i>
<i>Beth together, enjoying themselves...</i>

21
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,552
<i>...and that was enough to</i>
<i>make me worried and nervous.</i>

22
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:10,264
Love Doll Episode 3

23
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,247
Next!

24
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,584
Duke Dusee.

25
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,016
George. How is Rachel coming along?

26
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,651
She's progressing quite nicely.

27
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:11,254
We're fine tuning her for the
party the day after tomorrow.

28
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,158
Hmm...

29
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,545
So these are this year's
Love Doll candidates.

30
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,515
They appear to be good quality.

31
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,742
I wonder how many will
make it through the testing?

32
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,652
It should be fun!

33
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,199
I... I'm sorry.

34
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,162
Are you alright, Rosalie?

35
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,100
Huh? Lady Rachel.

36
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,904
What's wrong? You're not yourself recently.

37
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,981
I think you should ask for permission
to take a break and get some air.

38
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,505
Yes... That would be best.

39
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,811
Lady Rachel, you're very admirable.

40
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:06,746
What?

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,557
Here you are with worries of your
own but still you stop to help me.

42
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,494
I have to keep up an attitude.

43
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:18,931
If I'm intimidated here, all my efforts will have
been for nothing. I can't have that, right?

44
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,167
I've been working hard...

45
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,429
I don't want to waste that.

46
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,370
That girl...

47
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,095
Huh?

48
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,200
That's my younger sister.

49
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:34,176
She was sold to another house and has
been taking Love Doll lessons like you.

50
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,707
Is that so?

51
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,850
It's been two years since
we've seen each other.

52
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,714
She's become so beautiful.

53
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,116
Yes...

54
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,916
She's also gone
through some hard lessons.

55
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,154
Right.

56
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:50,356
She's never complained in her
letters, but I can feel her pain.

57
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,260
I know she's not as strong
as you, Lady Rachel.

58
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,237
When I think about how
other girls have felt in past...

59
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,102
...I'm so worried about her.

60
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,375
Your sister will be alright. I'm
sure she'll do fine on the test.

61
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,476
What?

62
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,172
It's just a hunch but...

63
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,108
Lady Rachel!

64
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,816
That girl you're taking care of...

65
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,944
She looks so much like your
sister, the legendary Love Doll.

66
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,884
That's her daughter.

67
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,856
Really?! So that's why she looks like her.

68
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,926
It's time to start the test.

69
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,925
Feels good!

70
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,899
She's a waste.
She came by herself.

71
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,025
You came too fast.

72
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,594
That's too bad.

73
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,163
This one's no good either.

74
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,604
Excuse me...

75
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:25,371
Huh?

76
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,177
Is something wrong?

77
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,541
No...nothing.

78
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,953
You know so much. I don't
really understand wine.

79
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,013
I really don't know how
to enjoy the taste yet.

80
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,317
But you're extremely intelligent.

81
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:45,765
I'm sure if you put your mind to it...

82
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,201
...you could be a great wine taster
and put any sommelier to shame.

83
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,997
You really know how to flatter a girl.

84
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,600
Have you heard the rumor
about Prince Andrew?

85
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,063
<i>Andrew?</i>

86
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,468
What about him?

87
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:01,914
I heard he's dating the
daughter of the Taylor family.

88
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:07,250
Yes, I heard the royal house will
soon make an announcement
about the Prince's marriage.

89
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,614
She must be his fiancйe.

90
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,820
<i>The daughter of the Taylor family...</i>

91
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,827
<i>That's Beth.</i>

92
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:17,760
Well...

93
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,192
We should go and begin your test now.

94
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:22,960
Yes...

95
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,312
Is something wrong?

96
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,616
You don't feel well?

97
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,548
N... no.

98
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,430
<i>This is no good.</i>
<i>I'm a Love Doll candidate.</i>

99
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,966
<i>This is not the time to</i>
<i>worry about other things.</i>

100
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,195
<i>Relax! No need to rush!</i>

101
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,177
It's starting to get good. I can't
tell you how great this feels.

102
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,415
<i>This is awesome!</i>

103
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,349
<i>Her mouth... sucking me off...</i>
<i>not even coming up for air.</i>

104
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,320
<i>I haven't had it this good in a long time.</i>

105
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,213
Anli!

106
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,718
<i>Amazing!</i>

107
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,722
<i>She acts like she's about to come</i>
<i>but then gets right back to work.</i>

108
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,427
<i>I can't figure out if she's faking it or not.</i>

109
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,724
Ah... Anli...

110
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,725
Your cock is so far inside me!

111
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,126
Touching the back wall of my pussy...

112
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,511
Ah... I can't hold it...
Do you mind if I come?

113
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,643
N...no. I'm going to come too.

114
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,903
Anli... How great...

115
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,734
You!

116
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,037
What... what's your name?

117
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,277
I'm simply Love Doll
candidate number three.

118
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,212
I can't tell you my name just yet.

119
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,113
Rachel, you did well.

120
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:15,355
You had many compliments from the party.

121
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,927
You also had the best
score of all the candidates.

122
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,755
I'm very proud of you.

123
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,724
Thank you very much.

124
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:27,431
<i>I was so worried about Andrew and Beth.</i>

125
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,009
<i>But I still had sex with</i>
<i>strangers without hesitating.</i>

126
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,105
<i>Furthermore, I didn't only just give</i>
<i>them pleasure. I enjoyed it as well.</i>

127
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,113
<i>What a awful woman I am...</i>

128
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,178
From now on, your lessons will
be over when you go to bed.

129
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:40,809
What?

130
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,687
You're usually forced to have sex,
even while you were sleeping...

131
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,726
...but starting today you'll be
allowed to sleep undisturbed.

132
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:55,167
Duke Dusee! The purpose of our
lesson is to take her to the extremes.

133
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:59,536
At this time, we should push her
even harder than we have before.

134
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,000
Shut up, George!

135
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,505
Y... yes sir.

136
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,077
I am pleased.

137
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,046
I want to give her a little break.

138
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,378
That is all.

139
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:14,848
<i>I want to see Andrew. Find out if</i>
<i>he's really getting married or not.</i>

140
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,067
<i>Andrew is staying at the</i>
<i>Royal Family's country home.</i>

141
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:41,203
<i>I'll have enough time to get</i>
<i>there and back by morning.</i>

142
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,618
<i>Lady Rachel?</i>

143
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,454
What are you doing up this late at night?

144
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,723
Um... well...

145
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,798
Are you planning to leave the residence?

146
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:09,231
Rosalie, there's something
I have to find out.

147
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,503
I'll be back by morning.

148
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,478
Please let me go. Please!

149
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,715
The west gate is
probably safest at this time.

150
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,448
The gatekeeper usually
gets drunk and passes out.

151
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,214
Rosalie?

152
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,484
Come this way.

153
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,168
Rosalie, why are you being so kind to me?

154
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,296
This is my thanks to you for
cheering me up at the party.

155
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,402
Really?

156
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,099
Yes.

157
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:47,179
I was very nervous because of my sister.

158
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:52,952
If you hadn't said something to me, I
could have made a really big mistake.

159
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:57,719
They might have thrown
me out of this house.

160
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,558
And how's your sister doing?

161
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,124
Thanks for asking. She's doing fine,
but not as well as you, Lady Rachel.

162
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,960
She did pass the test though.

163
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,766
Did she? That's great!

164
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,559
Well, leave from here.

165
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,037
But please come back by morning.

166
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,603
I understand. Thank you, Rosalie.

167
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,935
You didn't see me tonight.

168
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,613
Alright?

169
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:22,638
Yes.

170
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,607
Please take care.

171
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,550
Lady Rachel.

172
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:43,596
<i>Was it really this far? It felt much closer</i>
<i>when I went there during the day.</i>

173
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:46,632
<i>Huh?</i>

174
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,804
<i>It... It can't be...</i>

175
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,410
<i>Which way? Which way should I go?</i>

176
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,250
<i>The sun's coming up.</i>

177
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,160
<i>I don't think I can make it back before</i>
<i>people at the house start getting up.</i>

178
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,231
<i>What should I do?</i>

179
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,800
<i>But I've come this far. I really need to</i>
<i>see Andrew, no matter what happens.</i>

180
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,360
<i>Andrew, where are you?</i>
<i>Where's the house?</i>

181
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:21,228
Huh?

182
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,442
Rachel?! Is that you?

183
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:31,845
Beth...

184
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:42,626
Really? So Andrew's not here?

185
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:47,565
He's living at the Royal University
where he's studying the dynasties.

186
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,326
Beth...

187
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:50,200
What?

188
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,801
Is it true that you and
Andrew are getting married?

189
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,301
What... What are you talking about?!

190
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,103
Don't believe those stupid rumors.

191
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,175
I haven't learned how to be a wife
yet. I'm not ready to get married.

192
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:10,446
I'll admit that I've met him a few times
while he was staying here, but...

193
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,346
But...

194
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,247
...that's about it.

195
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,227
I'm so sorry.
Sorry for doubting you.

196
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,990
N...no. There's no need to apologize.

197
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,499
I am really sorry.

198
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,574
I'm the one who
should be apologizing to you.

199
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:32,141
What?

200
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,777
I have to be honest with you.
It is true that I love Andrew.

201
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,276
I know it's wrong to fall in love
with your best friend's boyfriend...

202
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,018
But don't worry.

203
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,353
It's you who Andrew loves.
He still loves you, Rachel.

204
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,726
He's tried everything he could to see you.

205
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,419
But your situation doesn't
allow for you to see anyone.

206
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:56,702
Even a member of the Royal Family.

207
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:00,297
He's decided to wait until the
day he can see you again.

208
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:02,835
My situation...

209
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,934
I... I took advantage of you.

210
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,674
I thought that I could
steal him away from you.

211
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,977
It was only for a split second...
and I didn't act on it. But...

212
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:19,216
...I'm a horrible person for even
thinking it. Do you hate me?

213
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,255
Thank you, Beth.

214
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,757
You told me the truth from your heart, even
though it must have been hard to admit.

215
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,491
You really are my best friend.

216
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,230
Rachel... you forgive me?

217
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,068
There's nothing to forgive.

218
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:37,736
Rachel...

219
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:43,774
Beth...

220
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,010
Rachel...

221
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,014
We shouldn't be doing this.

222
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,147
We did it once before at the convent.

223
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:03,256
Beth, you and I are still best
friends now. Nothing's changed...

224
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,157
But...

225
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,502
I can't...

226
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,506
It's okay, Beth.
Enjoy this as much as you want.

227
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,177
I'm happy just making you feel this way.

228
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:29,521
R... Rachel!

229
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,249
R... Rachel!

230
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,828
Rachel! No, it's dirty down there...

231
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,631
It's alright. It's your ass, Beth.
There's nothing dirty about it.

232
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:38,554
It... It feels strange. It tickles...
and I'm getting so hot...

233
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,901
Amazing! Beth, you're so wet.

234
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:00,468
Rachel, please!
Don't say things like that.

235
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,440
This is great!

236
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:11,050
Beth, can you do the same
things to me? Please!

237
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,555
Y...Yes. Ok.

238
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,533
I love you so much, Beth.

239
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,573
I love you too, Rachel.

240
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,973
Yeah. Yeah. I remember now.

241
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,412
That time the principal's face got like that.

242
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:50,986
Excuse me.

243
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,948
There's someone here
to pick up Lady Rachel.

244
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:54,920
Pick her up?

245
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,162
This way, sir.

246
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,066
I've come to take you home...

247
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,565
...Lady Rachel.

248
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,836
<i>No... no!</i>

249
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:31,526
Rachel?

250
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:36,790
Yes.

251
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:45,708
Rosalie!

252
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,942
Quickly! We have to get
her to a doctor! She'll die!!

253
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,512
Shut up! It's too late to call a doctor.

254
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,345
Uncle! It's my fault!
Rosalie didn't do anything.

255
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:04,453
Shut up! I've told you before, all
traitors have to pay for their actions.

256
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,997
But you didn't have to do this to Rosalie!

257
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,693
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

258
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,801
I was too generous.

259
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,073
I never expected my niece
to betray me like this.

260
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,042
You shall be punished!

261
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,106
No... Stop.

262
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,680
Please... Forgive me...

263
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:31,752
Please...

264
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,149
Give it to me.

265
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:36,951
Huh?

266
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:37,824
Duke Dusee!

267
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:39,822
Here.

268
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,867
Everyone leave the room.

269
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,436
Duke Dusee, what are you going to do?

270
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,830
Get out of here now!

271
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,107
I'm going to make you
keep your promise, Rachel.

272
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,948
NO!!

273
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,200
Just a little more, Rachel.

274
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,875
I know it's hard but hang on until the end.

275
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,206
You'll... Well...

276
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:14,916
Did it hurt?

277
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,182
What?

278
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:17,518
Uncle?

279
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,245
How sad...
