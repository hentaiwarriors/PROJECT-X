1
00:00:15,344 --> 00:00:19,007
There are two
meanings for time passing by...

2
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:21,448
...it means to forget the past...

3
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:23,342
...and it means...

4
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:25,917
...not to be able to undo the past.

5
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,147
If I put my hand on my chest...

6
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:32,817
...I can feel that
there is a hole in my heart.

7
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,397
It's already over, so I don't feel pain...

8
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:40,859
...but my fingers are
still looking for a place to go.

9
00:00:42,304 --> 00:00:44,135
I try to remember but I can't...

10
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:46,972
...yet I want to believe that I remember.

11
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:50,238
So I hold out my hand...

12
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:52,913
...and just keep doing the same thing.

13
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:55,177
I know that...

14
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:58,912
...it's just a fantasy I imagine.

15
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:01,553
If this is a punishment...

16
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:03,651
...at least, make it worthwhile.

17
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:34,779
Clair.

18
00:01:41,897 --> 00:01:42,591
Mom!

19
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:52,170
Mom...

20
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:42,115
Who are you guys?

21
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:45,986
We were ordered to take
you with us no matter what.

22
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:46,923
By whom?

23
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:49,423
If you see him, you will find out.

24
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:50,088
No!

25
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:51,227
Stop it!

26
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:52,400
No!

27
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:28,534
Hold!

28
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:35,640
Please, step out.

29
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:56,190
What does anyone want from me?

30
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,704
Thank you so much for coming.

31
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:11,812
Well...

32
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:32,558
Really...

33
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:34,494
You're stunning.

34
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:50,175
Pardon me.

35
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:09,961
That's a sudden move.

36
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:14,173
Oh, it's a regular greeting.

37
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:22,606
Meah!

38
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:26,987
That's not your job!

39
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,167
Pardon me for bringing you
here in a rough manner, Mr. Foster.

40
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:18,166
My name is Dred Barton.

41
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:20,932
Dred Barton!

42
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:22,834
You know me?

43
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:26,808
In this country,
everybody knows your name.

44
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:32,443
So, what does a railroad tycoon
want from a ruined man like me?

45
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,287
I have the perfect job for you.

46
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:38,753
For me?

47
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:42,594
I've done some research on you.

48
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:46,262
I know you're very
good at training women.

49
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:52,002
Excuse me.

50
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:00,270
What?

51
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,685
This girl owes me quite a lot of money.

52
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:11,818
Well, no need to give you the detail.

53
00:07:12,227 --> 00:07:15,321
I want you to train her to
be able to make a decent profit.

54
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:16,621
You must be kidding me.

55
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:22,058
I want you to think it over
whether or not to take this offer.

56
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:25,435
I hope you will give me a good answer.

57
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:45,354
What's your name?

58
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:47,791
It's Clair, sir.

59
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:49,496
Can you take off your blindfold?

60
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:50,120
Yes.

61
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:51,089
Take it off.

62
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:59,032
Was Dred correct in what he said?

63
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:00,306
Yes.

64
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,843
Will you obey my orders?

65
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:04,811
Yes.

66
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:09,847
Put your left leg on the table.

67
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:10,707
What?

68
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:11,843
Now!

69
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:13,711
Yes.

70
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:16,521
Spread your legs.

71
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:18,058
Now!

72
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:21,124
Wider!

73
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:33,073
Okay.

74
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:34,271
You passed.

75
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:39,380
I hear you are an expert on women?

76
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:41,472
I can tell by just looking at them.

77
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:44,246
You're a very confident man...

78
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:47,453
...for an ex-government
special forces agent.

79
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:50,047
I will have to train you, sometime.

80
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:51,687
I will look forward to it.

81
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,221
Welcome to my castle.

82
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:04,169
Now Clair is one of us.

83
00:09:11,713 --> 00:09:12,509
Clair.

84
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:15,213
Are you shaking?

85
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:17,083
How sweet!

86
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,393
Doesn't this feel good?

87
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:28,687
Don't be shy.

88
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:30,521
You're so beautiful!

89
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:34,229
Well, how about if I touch here?

90
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:37,404
Well...

91
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:40,538
Let me hear your dirty voice.

92
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:42,167
Louder!

93
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,291
Let's see your skill.

94
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:07,900
What?

95
00:10:12,574 --> 00:10:13,370
What's wrong?

96
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:16,276
I'm not in the mood.

97
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:16,908
What?

98
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:18,511
Don't worry.

99
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:20,881
We have enough time.

100
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,342
Plenty of time.

101
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,080
Nothing changes in this town.

102
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,559
In those days, when I did
nothing but wasting away...

103
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:11,425
...I didn't think anything would
be impossible to accomplish.

104
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:13,259
But, now what...

105
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,738
With just one piece of paper...

106
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,502
...I was hunted down as criminal.

107
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:33,848
I will never forget that humiliation.

108
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:11,415
No!

109
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:13,323
Use the tip of your tongue!

110
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:15,053
Concentrate on the tip!

111
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,260
Y-Yes.

112
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,027
Master.

113
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:53,422
I brought him here.

114
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:55,299
What is it?

115
00:12:55,837 --> 00:12:59,671
This afternoon, a very
important customer is coming here.

116
00:13:01,376 --> 00:13:03,469
How is Clair progressing?

117
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:07,910
It is a little too early for a customer.

118
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:11,751
Some like adolescent girls screaming.

119
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:15,647
There's a risk of ruining her,
like a fragile glass artwork.

120
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:17,490
If it happens, it happens.

121
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:20,419
In this kind of
business, it's not so unusual.

122
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:21,824
Also...

123
00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:25,661
...don't ever talk back to me.

124
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:33,271
I only want an obedient reply.

125
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:37,273
Yes.

126
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,938
I will get her prepared right away.

127
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:53,593
Come in!

128
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,660
No need to be scared, missy.

129
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:22,916
Ouch!

130
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:34,358
That's enough, dismissed!

131
00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:49,241
Just as I thought,
it was too soon for her.

132
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:50,869
That was bad.

133
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:55,104
But you knew it
was going to be like that, didn't you?

134
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,074
What are you trying to say?

135
00:15:58,486 --> 00:16:00,977
Why do you hate her so much?

136
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:02,789
Are you still thinking about Fahm?

137
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,357
You talk too much!

138
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:05,850
I apologize.

139
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:09,857
I shouldn't interfere with your past.

140
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,504
How are we going to take care of her?

141
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:23,333
It's not fun since she's not struggling.

142
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,508
Looking good, Clair.

143
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:32,976
You are such a well made instrument.

144
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,814
If someone plays you well,
you make a beautiful melody.

145
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:52,898
Oh, you are becoming like this.

146
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:02,345
Very honest.

147
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:07,478
Don't make a sound from now on.

148
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:22,194
You've been very patient.

149
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:24,028
I will give you a treat.

150
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:03,640
N-No...

151
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:06,875
No!

152
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:07,638
Not yet.

153
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:13,279
Now, Clair...

154
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:15,079
Look closely.

155
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,522
Take a good look at yourself.

156
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:20,658
Remind yourself...

157
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:23,192
...that you are just a plaything...

158
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:24,820
...and nothing more.

159
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:54,319
Why don't you run away?

160
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,904
What makes you so helpless?

161
00:19:06,674 --> 00:19:07,436
Please.

162
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:10,476
I must live.

163
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,574
So teach me how to.

164
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:17,009
There are easier ways to make a living.

165
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:20,181
But that is meaningless to me.

166
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,569
That was such a dry kiss.

167
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:47,675
I'm sorry.

168
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:50,880
It gets better when you get used to it.

169
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:19,029
Take care.

170
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:26,030
How is she?

171
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:27,840
She was just overworked.

172
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,343
She's been very
serious about something.

173
00:22:31,712 --> 00:22:32,235
I see.

174
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,211
She should take a good nap for now.

175
00:22:36,183 --> 00:22:39,152
How could the master
treat his own daughter like this.

176
00:22:40,254 --> 00:22:41,152
His own daughter?

177
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:43,820
Oh, didn't you know?

178
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:46,650
What's going on here!

179
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:50,358
You sensed it, no?

180
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:53,227
But you didn't want to admit it...

181
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:56,631
Fahm?

182
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:57,537
Yes.

183
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,114
What is it?

184
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,490
I have the right to know.

185
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:24,831
About Clair.

186
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,357
She's a good girl.

187
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:28,857
Then why?

188
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,502
That's why I don't like her.

189
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:39,745
I owned Fahm for a long time.

190
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:44,611
And a smart person like you
can understand what that means.

191
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,355
You and Fahm are both
criminals in this country.

192
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,757
You should admit that.

193
00:23:54,628 --> 00:23:55,686
Any other questions?

194
00:25:52,513 --> 00:25:56,142
Some days are good,
and some days are bad.

195
00:26:10,164 --> 00:26:11,290
Are you all right now?

196
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,731
I'm sorry for the trouble.

197
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:19,904
You can tell me your real story.

198
00:26:21,675 --> 00:26:23,700
This is where my memory lies.

199
00:26:25,045 --> 00:26:29,379
The money I owe is
the price for this mansion.

200
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:35,445
I sold myself to
have this mansion back.

201
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:37,647
I get the picture.

202
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:40,452
Clair.

203
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:47,527
As much as you want
this mansion, I want you.

204
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:56,203
If you can belong to
me, I will help you in return.

205
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:04,547
I am...

206
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:06,409
...yours.
