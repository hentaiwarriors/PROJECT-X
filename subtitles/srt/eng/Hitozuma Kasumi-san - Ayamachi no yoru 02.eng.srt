1
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,680
lt's a beautiful day to be at the beach.

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,510
lt sure is.

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,250
Hurry up Ryo!

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,290
l'm trying but...

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,820
Are you okay Ryo-kun?

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,830
Don't worry about it.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,060
What's taking you so long?

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,770
Hurry up and move it.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,600
Jeez, Harumi-chan...

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,000
l can't believe she made you carry all this.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,470
Sis, you're not carrying anything either.

12
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,680
Mama, you're so mean.

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,550
l'm sorry Ryo-kun. l'll carry something too.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,320
Don't worry Kasumi-san.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,480
l got this.

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,770
l'm sorry.

17
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,140
l thought you might feel a bit cooler.

18
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,570
Thank you Kasumi-san.

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,350
l feel refreshed.

20
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,790
You're just too much Ryo-kun.

21
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,890
l don't think that's nice.

22
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,760
You say that after making me hold your bag?

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,970
Well, that's because...

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,210
You said you'd carry it, so...

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,340
Plus l said l'll help you carry it, but you said no.

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,480
By the way, l wonder where Mio and Harumi-chan are.

27
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,790
There they are.

28
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,080
Look over there Ryo-kun.

29
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,110
Mio's just like a little kid.

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,710
Kasumi-san and l...

31
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,470
We've been doing it ever since that day.

32
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,720
Our thoughts and things that are important...

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,160
l sully it and stain it...

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,200
And we hurt each other's feelings in the process.

35
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,380
She knows it's that kind of relationship.

36
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,820
But still, she can't say anything about it...

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,500
<i>The Hills Have Size Vol. 2 Mutual Feelings</i>

38
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,270
Hey! Mio!

39
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,240
We're going home!

40
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay!

41
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,510
lt was so fun.

42
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,240
l had so much fun and now l'm really hungry!

43
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,480
You had so much fun and now you want to eat?

44
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,890
You're simple-minded.

45
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,650
lf you play for a very long time, you get hungry.

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,790
Compared to you, l'm still growing.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
Really?

48
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,360
l wonder what part of you is growing.

49
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,800
Mio, Harumi-chan...

50
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,870
Can you two go buy some food for dinner?

51
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,080
l don't mind.

52
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,580
l'm counting on you two.

53
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,320
You two pick out what you want to eat for dinner.

54
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,490
Choose what you want but be nice.

55
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,320
l want some meatballs!

56
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,990
Meatballs? That's why you're still small like a child!

57
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,430
When l become an adult, l'll have a great body like mama!

58
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,770
Kasumi-san, you want to talk to me about something right?

59
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,210
l'm willing to do whatever you want me to.

60
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,450
Kasumi-san?

61
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,210
Ryo-kun!

62
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,440
l received a phone call yesterday...

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,580
She said she was my husband's lover...

64
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,490
l know l can't say anything since l've been cheating on him too...

65
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,230
But l felt very sad and hurt yesterday...

66
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,800
l felt like my heart was going to burst.

67
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,730
l just wanted to forget about everything.

68
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,040
So you came to my room?

69
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,120
But, you know what?

70
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,980
lt felt painful when you were making love to me.

71
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,920
Why?

72
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,860
At the time, l didn't know why...

73
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,750
But l finally understood when l came to the beach today.

74
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,990
ls it because of Mio?

75
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,070
Yes.

76
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,070
l saw her smile and realized what l had to do.

77
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,470
l have to be Mio's mother before l pursue my own interests as a woman.

78
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:27,110
And the pain l felt was a warning since l tried to forget my duties as a mother.

79
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,780
Kasumi-san...

80
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,950
l'll talk things over with Hisashi-san.

81
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,260
l'm sure he'll understand.

82
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,830
lt's the best thing we can do for Mio.

83
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,640
You're right.

84
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,010
Ryo-kun...

85
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,110
We're ending our relationship today.

86
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,950
So l want you to do me real hard.

87
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,320
l want to feel you for the very last time!

88
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,570
Ryo-kun, more...

89
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,350
l want you to do me harder...

90
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,390
So strong...

91
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,500
Kasumi-san, are you okay?

92
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,610
l'm okay.

93
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,770
More, l want more...

94
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,980
l want you to mess me up!

95
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,550
Kasumi-san...

96
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,490
Do it harder.

97
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,660
Much deeper!

98
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,360
l want to remember this feeling...

99
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,760
Your hot, hard cock...

100
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,070
lt feels good Kasumi-san!

101
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,500
l think l'm about to climax...

102
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,240
l'm about to...

103
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,980
Release it inside.

104
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,750
l want you to release your milk inside me!

105
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,680
l want your hot, thick milk.

106
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,020
Release it inside.

107
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,130
l want to taste and feel your milk!

108
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,030
l'm coming!

109
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,760
l'm releasing it inside!

110
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,510
Ryo-kun...

111
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,990
You released lots of milk inside me...

112
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,530
Ryo-kun...

113
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,130
Thank you.

114
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,640
Hisashi-san is coming back tonight, so l'll talk to him tonight.

115
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,380
l'll tell him everything and find out what his thoughts are.

116
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,850
Okay.

117
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,660
Don't worry, l won't mention your name.

118
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,160
Well l...

119
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,490
You shouldn't feel bad.

120
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,000
lt's all my fault.

121
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,150
That's not true.

122
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,590
lt's not your fault Kasumi-san.

123
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,530
l don't want to hear any excuses, don't mock me!

124
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,070
l let you live the kind of life you want.

125
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,200
But l didn't expect you to cheat on me.

126
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,850
l know l cheated on you.

127
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,780
But you also cheated on me.

128
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:55,710
You think a man of my status would be satisfied with just my wife?

129
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,760
Anyway, l want you to stop seeing this lover of yours immediately.

130
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,660
Got it?

131
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,150
What about you?

132
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,760
Me?

133
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,120
You want me to stop seeing my lover, too?

134
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,260
That's right.

135
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,930
That's how normal couples...

136
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,340
Nonsense!

137
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:22,050
Can't you tell? You can't satisfy my needs anymore!

138
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,750
End of conversation.

139
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,280
l don't care how much it costs.

140
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,020
l don't want you to see your lover ever again.

141
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,390
You got that Kasumi?

142
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,670
Ryo-kun...

143
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,570
Were you watching?

144
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,710
l'm sorry, l...

145
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,910
You don't need to apologize.

146
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,560
Once again, you saw me in an embarrassing situation.

147
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,120
No...

148
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,450
Ryo-kun...

149
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,430
l just want to be alone right now.

150
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,170
Please...

151
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,630
l understand.

152
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,580
l...

153
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,020
l...

154
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,340
Man, it's morning already?

155
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,280
Sir?

156
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,220
Ryoji?

157
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,120
What are you doing at this time?

158
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,690
Where's Kasumi-san?

159
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,900
She's gone.

160
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,390
Look.

161
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,530
She even left this thing behind!

162
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,430
ls that what l think it is?

163
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,530
l don't know what kind of man she was seeing, but l didn't expect it to be this serious.

164
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,770
Ryoji!

165
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,970
Do you have any idea?

166
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,240
Like places Kasumi went or some man that came to visit.

167
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,870
l really don't know...

168
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,420
What a stupid woman!

169
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,650
She didn't even think about my situation.

170
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,330
Now how am l supposed to...

171
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,720
<i>You're pathetic papa!</i>

172
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,850
Mio...

173
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,120
What are you doing here Mio?

174
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,390
What do you mean ''situation''?

175
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,120
You only care about yourself!

176
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,860
You never cared about mama, that's why she...

177
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,810
Yeah.

178
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,600
lt's that time already?

179
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,050
No, it's okay. No problem.

180
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,810
l'll be on my way, so l'll meet you there.

181
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,820
Yeah, that's right.

182
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,750
l'll make it on time if there's no traffic.

183
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,420
No, l left the materials there.

184
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,760
Bring it with you.

185
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,900
Mio...

186
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,860
Onii-chan...

187
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,670
Onii-chan...

188
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,010
Harumi-san...

189
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,890
l need to talk to you Ryo.

190
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,350
lt's about my sister.

191
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,480
About Kasumi-san?

192
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,170
Onii-chan?

193
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,800
Wrong. lt's me.

194
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,770
Harumi?

195
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,270
Where's Onii-chan?

196
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,940
He went out, he said it was an emergency.

197
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,040
l see.

198
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,980
Don't be mad, Mio.

199
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,950
He said it was very important.

200
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,740
Harumi-san...

201
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,280
You said you wanted to talk about Kasumi-san.

202
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,490
Why?

203
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,220
Why does it have to be my sister? Ryo!

204
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,990
She has her husband and Mio!

205
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,770
l know.

206
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,210
But l...

207
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,300
You're serious about her?

208
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,370
Yeah.

209
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,900
Fine.

210
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,920
She's waiting for you at the beach we went yesterday.

211
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,350
l'll look after Mio.

212
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,490
Hey Mio, do you like Ryo?

213
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,490
Yeah.

214
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,630
He's really nice to me and mama.

215
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,820
l see.

216
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,130
So you like him, huh?

217
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,830
You like him don't you?

218
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,070
l don't know about that.

219
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,080
That's not fair.

220
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,110
l answered your question but you won't answer mine.

221
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,340
That's right, adults are supposed to be unfair.

222
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,490
Kasumi-san...

223
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,760
Ryo-kun...

224
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,300
You came for me.

225
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,630
l see.

226
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,640
Mio said that?

227
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,340
l failed as a mother.

228
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,410
l can only think about what's good for me.

229
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,070
What's good for you?

230
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,680
Yes, l think two weeks must've gone by.

231
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,690
l couldn't stop thinking about something.

232
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,260
Thinking about what?

233
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,560
About you.

234
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,120
From the moment l wake up to the moment l sleep...

235
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,030
l was always thinking about you.

236
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,030
But l thought that was because l felt lonely.

237
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:26,040
l felt lonely, so l needed someone in place of my husband.

238
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,980
l would be happy with any man out there.

239
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,740
That's what l thought.

240
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,120
But you were there for me.

241
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,760
That's all it ever was.

242
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,560
Kasumi-san...

243
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,100
But it wasn't like that at all.

244
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,500
My thoughts about you grew stronger.

245
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,960
l couldn't think about anything else.

246
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,500
l was very scared.

247
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,670
So l thought l had to do something...

248
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,640
While l can still go back.

249
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,180
That's why...

250
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,180
But it didn't work.

251
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,650
He wouldn't look at me as a woman.

252
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:17,590
l'm so stupid, l knew about it, but l stayed with him.

253
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,990
l had no place to go in the first place.

254
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,400
But you didn't have to leave.

255
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,800
Your husband had a lover.

256
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,960
You also have Mio...

257
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,940
l can't stay in that house.

258
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,940
lf l stay, you...

259
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,870
You'll be unhappy.

260
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,450
lf l stay in that house, l'll bring lots of misfortune.

261
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,350
l don't believe that.

262
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,460
No, l know it.

263
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,190
l know myself real well.

264
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,190
l can't hold back my feelings.

265
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,800
Your life starts now. You'll meet lots of people...

266
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,630
...and be happy with the one you love the most.

267
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,810
You'll get tired of being with an old lady like me.

268
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,150
l don't want to get in your way!

269
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,790
Kasumi-san!

270
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,780
Don't say such selfish things!

271
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,930
Don't you know how l feel?

272
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,390
Your feelings?

273
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,590
l don't want to live without you, l already found the one l love.

274
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,440
That's why l came to see you.

275
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,110
But l...

276
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,740
You don't have to say anymore.

277
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,840
l love you Kasumi-san.

278
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,840
l want to live my life with you.

279
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,550
Ryo-kun...

280
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,250
l love you too.

281
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,610
l love you very much.

282
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,050
l want to make love to you.

283
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,620
Ryo-kun...

284
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,250
Me too...

285
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,110
Wait a minute Ryo-kun, l have to shower...

286
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,910
l can't wait anymore, l want you right now.

287
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,110
Please.

288
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,710
Wait just a minute.

289
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,290
Kasumi-san, that's...

290
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,950
l forgot to leave it at home.

291
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,220
Okay, l'm ready.

292
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,470
Kasumi-san...

293
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,040
Ryo-kun, there's no need to rush.

294
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,580
l'm a bit worried.

295
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,710
l feel you might disappear from my sight.

296
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,350
Don't worry.

297
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:56,980
l'm not going anywhere, because you're here by my side.

298
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,450
l'll always be by your side.

299
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,630
Ryo-kun...

300
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,460
l want you to feel my nipples.

301
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,130
Over here?

302
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,900
Yes, keep going.

303
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,270
Yes, that's good Ryo-kun.

304
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,250
Ryo-kun...

305
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,680
l want you to touch all over my body.

306
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,740
That's it.

307
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,490
lt's very wet Kasumi-san.

308
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,250
You can hear how wet it is.

309
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,760
Don't say that, it's embarrassing.

310
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,860
Do it harder.

311
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,410
Kasumi-san?

312
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,780
Ryo-kun, l can't take it anymore.

313
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,130
l want your hard cock.

314
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,190
Your hot, hard cock...

315
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,970
it's going deep inside me.

316
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,270
lt feels tighter than usual.

317
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,640
Ryo-kun, your hot cock...

318
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,140
Your hot cock...

319
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,250
lt feels so good, Ryo-kun...

320
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,660
Do me harder!

321
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,620
Your hard cock...

322
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,560
l can feel it deep inside...

323
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,130
Ryo-kun!

324
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,140
Ryo-kun!

325
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,940
Are you okay Kasumi-san?

326
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,840
l'm okay.

327
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,640
l want you to do me more.

328
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,650
Your cock feels so good.

329
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,650
So l want you to make me feel hotter.

330
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,580
l want you to melt me so we can be together as one.

331
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,320
Kasumi-san.

332
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,890
Ryo-kun?

333
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,560
Let's do it Kasumi-san, we'll be together as one.

334
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,660
Deeper! Deeper!

335
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,470
Kasumi-san...

336
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,070
l love you Kasumi-san!

337
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,150
Ryo-kun! l...

338
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,580
l love you too!

339
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,840
l think l'm about to climax...

340
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,420
Me too...

341
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,860
We'll climax together!

342
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,430
Let's climax together!

343
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,430
Please, come inside me!

344
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,810
Ryo-kun...

345
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,490
Kasumi-san...

346
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,840
The one you shouldn't fall in love with...

347
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,870
...is the one you ended up falling in love with.

348
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,550
She's standing right next to me.

349
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,250
l'm sure there'll be lots of things waiting for us.

350
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,520
But l want to keep standing next to this person forever.

351
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,930
That's how l felt in my heart.
