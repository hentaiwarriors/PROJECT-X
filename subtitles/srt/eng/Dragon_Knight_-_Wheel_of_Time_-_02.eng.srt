1
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,857
Ole! Ole!

2
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,004
Wow, oh man!

3
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,938
Oh, please look this way!

4
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,148
Would you like some alcohol, Natasha?

5
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,649
{\i1} {\i}\NI'll have a little wine, then.

6
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,884
{\kf900000}Hey, back off, dude.

7
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,253
Like I said, nothing beats a\Ndagger in close range combat.

8
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,155
Nereid, you'll get drunk at that rate.

9
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,656
Don't worry about it, all right?

10
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:59,059
{\kf900000}Man, you're just way too wimpy, Seil.

11
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,560
I don't know about this...

12
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,897
{\kf900000}Now here they are. I even got you\N{\kf900000}the artillery you've been dying for.

13
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,733
Of course you'll want\Nthem to join, right?

14
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,102
From the left, it's Garvin,\NNecromancer, Santos, and

15
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,574
Sarah from a ninja unit.

16
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,576
She's proud of her legs\Nbeing so nimble and quick.

17
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,280
That's not all. Don't forget these\Nlegs are sleek, shapely, and elegant.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,315
Thanks for having me.

19
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,818
There are some problems\Nwith her personality.

20
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,479
As long as she is capable,\Nit's not a problem.

21
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,116
Is the leader of your force here? I'd\Nlike to see him. Where is he?

22
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,067
My name is Bianca.

23
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,869
I am a knight of Ronboni.

24
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:20,707
I am not really the leader, as we all\Nconsider ourselves equal comrades.

25
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,676
She's the princess\Nwho was in the castle.

26
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:27,180
I have heard you are the\Nonly force that's defeated

27
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,349
Lucifon's armies while\Nadvancing eastward.

28
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,147
I ask that I may be\Nallowed to join you.

29
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,354
Of course, we welcome you eagerly.

30
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,825
We'll fight together. Feel free to\Ndemonstrate your skills in our struggle.

31
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,095
Do you not have a test or some trial?

32
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,832
I pride myself in matching anyone\Nin handling a lance or a sword.

33
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,928
Forgive me if I have\Nwounded your pride.

34
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,073
But the fact is, in our situation\Nwe can use any help we can get.

35
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,942
I see. It does seem you\Nare short on manpower.

36
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,447
Yes, but please don't dwell on that.

37
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:06,486
Everyone here is allied together to\Ndefeat Lucifon.

38
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,716
Kick Lucifon's ass!

39
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,649
We'll take off tomorrow at dawn.

40
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,619
But for tonight, please,\Nhave a glass, Bianca.

41
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,254
Hey, is it like, did you come after me?

42
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,824
Oh, of course not! I... I...

43
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,960
I wanted to become a\Nsorceress like my mom.

44
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,628
So I wanted to... To do training.

45
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,697
That's right. Why would\NI come after you?

46
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,365
It's nothing like that!

47
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,528
So like Mom, huh?

48
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,300
But even Mom, and everyone else...

49
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,844
Don't worry! Once we defeat Lucifon,\Neverything will be back to normal.

50
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,311
You're right.

51
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,244
Once we defeat Lucifon...

52
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,354
Hey, about the talisman I gave you!

53
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,855
Do you still have it?

54
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,689
{\kf900000}Yeah, I got it.

55
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,857
Let me see.

56
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,860
{\kf900000}Okay! What?

57
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,362
What's wrong?

58
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,796
{\kf900000}Weird...

59
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:27,233
I bet you lost it long\Nago! That's it, isn't it?

60
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,793
Why would you care about\Nanything I gave you?!

61
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,303
Hey! There it is!

62
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,880
See, I had it around my\Nneck, but before I knew it,

63
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,883
it slipped down into my underpants.

64
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,351
No way.

65
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,853
There.

66
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,988
{\kf900000}Oh, all right. I've seen\N{\kf900000}it, now just put it away.

67
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,957
Oh, okay. What? Did it smell?

68
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,655
I'm joking, it's a joke. I had it around\Nmy neck the whole time.

69
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,567
Kakeru, you never change, do you?

70
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,069
What's that?

71
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,804
{\kf900000}You've just liked to make fun of\N{\kf900000}me, ever since we were small.

72
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,539
You think so?

73
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,301
You always do.

74
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,343
Even when I try to talk\Nabout something serious,

75
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,345
you poke fun or do\Nsomething I can't stand.

76
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,547
Well...

77
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,242
Why can't you act more grown up?

78
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,973
I don't care how good you are with a\Nsword as long as you act like a child!

79
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,446
Like how Eto is all grown up?

80
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,556
What does Eto have to do with this?!

81
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,318
You like Eto, don't you, Natasha?

82
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,434
What? Why?

83
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,334
Somehow, I can tell...

84
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,531
Oh, forget it. Why don't you\Njust go away and leave me alone?

85
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,026
Who is it?!

86
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,965
Hey, hi...

87
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,433
{\kf900000}Eto! Oh, so you were watching?!

88
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,799
Well, I guess...

89
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,735
So, you had a fight with Kakeru?

90
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,138
Yes, I guess I did.

91
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,414
Oh, why does Kakeru act\Nlike that all the time?

92
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,187
Well... Look, he may act like that,

93
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:31,156
but I imagine that's because\Nhe wants your attention.

94
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,995
But Kakeru... He's always\Nacting as if he's a child.

95
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:39,089
Just look at how he\Ntreated my talisman.

96
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,464
Well, he said it was\Njust part of a joke.

97
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:48,439
He couldn't stand admitting out loud\Nhow he cherished that talisman.

98
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,279
Natasha, he was embarrassed\Nover letting you know that.

99
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,940
That's why he said that.

100
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,050
Really? But...

101
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,219
Hey! You were listening in on\Nus all that time, weren't you?!

102
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,881
Oh, I'm sorry.

103
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,447
No, it doesn't bother me.

104
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:12,089
Whenever I talk to Kakeru, it\Nseems like we end up fighting.

105
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:16,202
Right now, I'm sure Kakeru is feeling\Nguilty too, over how he acted.

106
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,371
He's wishing he hadn't done that.

107
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,774
Well, I don't feel guilty at all!

108
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,209
Oh, really?

109
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,143
It seemed like you were depressed.

110
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,547
I'm not depressed, I'm just frustrated!

111
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,017
Both of you aren't acting\Nforthright enough.

112
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,321
Natasha, might you be wondering\Nwhy you become so flustered

113
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,723
when you're dealing with Kakeru?

114
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,026
I'm not acting flustered!

115
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,824
You keep getting into fights because\Nyou disguise your feelings too much.

116
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,727
As if you knew anything about this!

117
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,258
I'm really sorry, Eto.

118
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:55,035
For a moment, it seemed like\NI was talking to Kakeru.

119
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,999
No, it's all right.

120
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,774
I'll go to sleep now. Goodnight.

121
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,781
All right.

122
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,128
Well, let's see if you can catch\Nup with my beautiful, fast legs.

123
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,086
All yours now!

124
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,033
Magic users, ready!

125
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,629
Easy now, easy!

126
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,902
Not yet, wait...

127
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,904
Magic users, commence fire!

128
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,865
No, wait, Bianca!\NDon't jump the gun!

129
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,767
Hey, that's not fair!

130
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,234
No, not yet!

131
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,663
Kakeru, go back to Natasha\Nand stop them.

132
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,940
Yeah, sure!

133
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,903
That damn spitfire!

134
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,751
Swordsmen! Calvary! Charge!

135
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,787
Natasha! Stop! Stop now!

136
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,489
Nereid! Call off the magic!

137
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,356
Necromancer! Stop now!\NBianca is in there!

138
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,656
Bianca, heads up!

139
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,668
Pull! Now! One! Two!

140
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,135
Three!

141
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,479
Hey, wait a sec!

142
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,947
Kakeru! Just hold on!

143
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,407
Thanks, Neptune!

144
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,712
Neptune!

145
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,662
It would seem we need\Na dragon unit as well.

146
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,229
We just need to hang\Nin there a while more.

147
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,474
You must persuade me.

148
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,440
Lucifon's powers can be\Ncountered if I am with you.

149
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,903
Tonight we'll rest at\Nthis village of hobbits.

150
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,640
Make sure you get\Nwell rested, everyone.

151
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,226
Are you the commander?

152
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,228
Are you the sappers we heard about?

153
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,734
We'd like to come along,\Nif we may, dear sir.

154
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,536
We'll help you out real good!

155
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,468
Nice to be workin' with ya!

156
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,348
Oh, Seil...

157
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,253
I don't know...

158
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,720
Come here.

159
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,262
Eto...

160
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,388
{\kf900000}Who is it?

161
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,163
I've been waiting for you.

162
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,070
I'm not in the mood, if that\Nwas what you were thinking.

163
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,007
While you may not be\Ninterested in finding out,

164
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,009
I am interested in seeing\Nhow skilled you are.

165
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,611
Wasn't the fighting on\Nthe battlefield enough?

166
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,281
No, I must fight you directly.

167
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:39,445
Unless we do, you will not be able\Nto learn of my true strengths.

168
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,790
I am well aware of\Nyour strengths, so...

169
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,495
I wish to assess your\Nstrengths. Please.

170
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,030
There's no need for this.

171
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,932
Are you mocking me?

172
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,264
No, but I am thoroughly appalled.

173
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,974
What do you think you are doing?

174
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,169
I will have you unsheathe\Nyour sword, no matter what.

175
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,314
I can only respect valiant,\Npowerful men.

176
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,648
I've had enough of the feeble, gossipy\Nmen so prevalent at my castle.

177
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,355
You claim I am like them?

178
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,823
I am about to find out.

179
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:28,868
Bianca, do you judge men\Nsimply by their swordsmanship?

180
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,462
What else is there?

181
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,974
You are still a child then.

182
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,108
{\kf900000}What?!

183
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,542
The strength of men lies elsewhere.

184
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,736
Then what is it?

185
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,856
Impossible...

186
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,599
How could I be so easily...

187
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,866
That should be enough.

188
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,204
Once more!

189
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,069
It won't make any difference.

190
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,040
Are you afraid of losing to me?

191
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,678
Losing? Winning? Who\Nare our true enemies?

192
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:21,284
Even now, the forces of Lucifon\Nare increasing their numbers.

193
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:26,659
We need to rest ourselves, so that\Nwe can proceed as soon as possible.

194
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,160
Isn't that right?

195
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,424
{\kf900000}I must be convinced before\N{\kf900000}any of this matters!

196
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,185
I'll have to teach this selfish\Nprincess a little lesson,

197
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,847
so she'll never exhibit\Nsuch bad behavior.

198
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,193
What are you doing?!

199
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,326
Have you no shame?!

200
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,834
Let go!

201
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,072
Stop!

202
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:21,873
Stop this at once! Do you have any\Nidea what it means to soil my skin?

203
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:28,786
Those who dared to touch\Nme in the palace...

204
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,047
Princess Bianca, listen to me!

205
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,721
Princess, you will not\Nbe able to defeat me.

206
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,631
Are you a woman who will do\Nanything to elevate her honor?

207
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,154
No!

208
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,217
Stop!

209
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:20,538
My journey with the others has nothing\Nto do with inflating your pride.

210
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,153
Stuck-ups and those brandishing\Negotist pride are

211
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,246
nothing more than a burden on us\Nright now.

212
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,350
We don't have room for that!

213
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,565
We have no need for some\Nswell-headed woman in our ranks.

214
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,940
What I... what we need is to

215
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,975
share pain and joy amongst ourselves

216
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,943
as we march toward defeating Lucifon!

217
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,845
Comrades in arms!

218
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,345
Eto...

219
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:39,716
Your eyes... They're filled\Nwith such sadness.

220
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,160
You must have lost someone very dear.

221
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,936
We cannot allow ourselves\Nto be defeated by Lucifon.

222
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:07,538
To win, we need your help, Bianca.

223
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,323
Hurry it up!

224
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,324
{\kf900000}What's holding us up?!

225
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,425
We have room for another ten.

226
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,586
{\kf900000}Get the women and children on first!

227
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,855
All ahead full!

228
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,231
Wow!

229
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,495
You're still awake?

230
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,331
Yes...

231
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,632
{\kf900000}It seems everyone is asleep already.

232
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,467
Yes...

233
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,628
{\kf900000}You must persuade me.

234
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,307
I'd like to secure more\Nbows and arrows.

235
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:45,572
Yes, we'll see what we\Ncan do in the next town.

236
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,953
Marlene...

237
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,709
What do you plan to do\Nwhen you meet Lucifon?

238
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,045
Of course, take revenge\Nfor the death of my...

239
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,512
Are you sure?

240
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,448
I have the feeling that you will try\Nto prevent us from defeating him.

241
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,616
Why? How could you say...

242
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:37,554
You mustn't. You will regret doing so\Nmuch later.

243
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,803
How would you know of such things?

244
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,739
Because you yourself told me.

245
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,776
I don't recall mentioning\Nany such thing to you.

246
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:54,313
No, you wouldn't. Your\Nfuture self told me so.

247
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,382
Eto, I don't fathom what you're saying.

248
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,043
You wouldn't know right now.

249
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,622
What I am talking about is from\Nanother continuum of history,

250
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,147
a future event that takes place there.

251
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,991
Me in the future?

252
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,898
You told me you're from Trianon.

253
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,632
But that's a lie, isn't it?

254
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,809
Truth is, you are from... from\Nsomeplace far, far away, I believe.

255
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,371
Just like me. I have also\Ntraveled from a far off place.

256
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:36,681
Or I should say, came\Nback from a far off place.

257
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,083
I came from the future.

258
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:44,860
I came from the future using the\Nblack stone that you gave me there.

259
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,433
The black stone!

260
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:59,203
You know about the black stone,\Ndon't you? And what it can do.

261
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,809
Marlene, I am Kakeru.

262
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,384
That... That can't be!

263
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,090
I used to be Kakeru.

264
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,661
Now I am following through\Nthe flow of time yet again.

265
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,729
You can't believe me?

266
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,205
I'll let you know something.\NThis ship is about to sink.

267
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,303
Sink?

268
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,935
It's dragons!

269
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,736
{\kf900000}They're...

270
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,503
Fold the...

271
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,800
{\kf900000}Let's run...

272
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,811
Eto! Marlene! Big trouble!

273
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,381
Douse the flames!

274
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,229
Fire!

275
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,849
Captain! Will the ship make it?

276
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,579
No! It's going down! Now!

277
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,452
Those damn bastards! My ship!

278
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,924
Eto, the bow is taking in water fast!

279
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,688
What are we going\Nto do? I can't swim.

280
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,287
If you don't want to\Ndie, you'll have to jump!

281
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,715
Marlene, are you all right?

282
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,878
Yes...

283
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,948
Come on, everyone! Abandon ship!

284
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,098
Natasha!

285
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,792
{\kf900000}Okay...

286
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,338
She's going down.

287
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,896
{\kf900000}Yes, just like it did before.

288
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,310
What's going to happen to us now?

289
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,676
Just make sure not to drown.

290
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,708
We'll take this up later.

291
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,007
I'll go ahead then.

292

305
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,961
How can I get Marlene\Nto open her heart to me?

306
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:27,091
While I grow ever more anxious, the\Nfighting grows ever more intense.

307
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,859
My friends fall, one by one.

308
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,604
As we get closer to Reimling Castle,

309
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,572
more powerful forces of Lucifon block\Nour path.

310
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:39,300
But the time has come when a friend\Nwill awaken to his true powers.
