1
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:06,246
The inconspicuous girl who suddenly
takes action during summer camp, Nami.

2
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:12,347
We wandered into a giant mansion,
as if it beckoned us.

3
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:18,026
But still, why is she all over Natsuki?

4
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:40,442
So that's what's going on.

5
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:43,383
Let's go, Natsuki! Time to transform!

6
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:57,530
Septem Charm Magical Kanan

7
00:00:57,671 --> 00:01:00,162
Palpitating Summer Camp Part 2

8
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:10,906
So that means everyone's...

9
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:23,861
Mafuyu.

10
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:25,889
Miss Taeko.

11
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,067
This is wonderful, Mafuyu.

12
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:06,602
Miss Taeko, I can't wait.

13
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,442
It's okay, just shut up.

14
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:17,906
You want more?

15
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:25,179
It feels so good inside of you.

16
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:51,206
No, stop it!

17
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:54,810
Let go of me!

18
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:32,481
What the hell!
Why do I put up with this crap?

19
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,106
Chihaya.

20
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,858
Who can I loathe?

21
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,959
Tell me!

22
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,842
This is the heart of the Netherworld Tree?

23
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,960
Is anyone in there?

24
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,300
It's no use here, either.

25
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,643
Time to go!

26
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:05,083
Chihaya, you can't just keep running.

27
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:10,479
You can't, Nami. Now's not the time
to be doing that.

28
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,386
I was so happy when you asked me
to play with you.

29
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,422
Come on, Natsuki, let's play.

30
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:41,610
That feels good.

31
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:47,559
It's only just begun.

32
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:49,026
Damn, that feels good.

33
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:54,566
That's it. You can come on my breasts
if you want to.

34
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:58,627
I can't do that. I have Chihaya.

35
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,570
Is that so? But Chihaya can't do this,
can she?

36
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,274
You can't...

37
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:14,586
To being with, it's all Natsuki's fault...

38
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:17,589
for being such a man whore
and becoming Nami's bitch.

39
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:19,591
Not being where he should
be when he should be!

40
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,651
To top it off, we get lost in this
humongous mansion.

41
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:44,843
Chihaya?

42
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:47,750
I'm not letting you go.

43
00:06:48,688 --> 00:06:49,620
Nami.

44
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,520
You're mine.

45
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:56,428
I'm not handing you over to Chihaya.

46
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,622
I'm going to come.

47
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,689
"Come?" That's it!

48
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,643
Wasn't that good?

49
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:14,703
But it's even better inside of Nami.

50
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:19,713
Natsuki?

51
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:24,212
Chihaya!

52
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,751
Hey, what's going on?

53
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:17,504
What do you think you're doing?

54
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:39,788
At this rate I'll... Natsuki!

55
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:45,797
Natsuki, give me power.
And look at only me.

56
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:08,383
I don't want to do it with anyone
other than Natsuki.

57
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:11,888
Natsuki, save me.

58
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:55,607
Right now, the only ones
who can stop the Netherworld Tree...

59
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:57,074
are Chihaya and Natsuki

60
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:58,906
I have to find them.

61
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:15,750
No!

62
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,621
Save me, Natsuki!

63
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:24,697
You can't.

64
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:36,782
Chihaya!

65
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:48,921
Sayaka!

66
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,197
Wait!

67
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,604
Please don't harm Sayaka.

68
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:04,109
I have her replacement right here.

69
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,339
I won't run away anymore.

70
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:50,889
I can't sit there and let Sayaka die.

71
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:53,215
I won't do it.

72
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:06,904
Tsuyoshi became a Seed human?

73
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:09,998
Stupid Natsuki!

74
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:13,734
Stop it!

75
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:24,712
Stop it!

76
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,019
Chihaya!

77
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,941
Natsuki!

78
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:50,038
Chihaya!

79
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:19,769
I won't lose now!

80
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:26,479
Carmine Eco-Shower!

81
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:32,355
The Eco-Shower won't come out?

82
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:33,624
Why?

83
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,527
Chihaya?

84
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:36,987
Natsuki?

85
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:40,188
I'm sorry. I wasn't at full power.

86
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,091
Natsuki!

87
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:46,403
My power.

88
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:19,126
Chihaya?

89
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:31,139
Chihaya, you okay?

90
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:36,578
Natsuki, where's everyone?

91
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,923
The mansion was burned down by lighting.

92
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:45,757
The only ones they found
at the front were us two and Sayaka.

93
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:50,632
No way! It can't be,
everyone was still in there?

94
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:53,170
- You shouldn't move around yet.
- But...

95
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:57,739
Sayaka wants to see you.

96
00:14:58,044 --> 00:15:00,308
Sayaka does? Where is she?

97
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,180
She's next door to us, but...

98
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:06,577
There's no need to worry, everybody's safe.

99
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,652
Really?

100
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:10,120
All right!

101
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:11,178
But...

102
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,584
They are being swallowed
by the Netherworld Tree.

103
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:28,367
I met another me there.

104
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:32,644
There was a cave underneath that mansion.

105
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:35,877
That's where I disappeared to.

106
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:38,074
Everyone must be there!

107
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:39,047
Yeah!

108
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:43,279
It's so lonely there. Please save them!

109
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:44,851
Of course we will.

110
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:46,023
Natsuki, let's go!

111
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:47,214
Yeah!

112
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:58,226
It's so lonely there, the Seed is...

113
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:04,641
The problem is getting out of here.

114
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:08,044
We can't worry the parents
any more than they already are.

115
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:09,970
You know?

116
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,347
Natsuki, come here!

117
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:18,019
Chihaya, you don't have to do
it at such a kinky place like this.

118
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,856
No, you idiot!

119
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:23,986
Then what is it?

120
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:25,085
This!

121
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,261
The size doesn't fit at all,
but I'll have to make do.

122
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:36,335
Let's go, Natsuki!

123
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:39,139
Where are you looking at!

124
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,984
Do you sense anything?

125
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,784
It's a wonder how good
just a change of clothes is.

126
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:54,416
God, I can't believe you!
What are you thinking at a time like this?

127
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:59,256
Acting cute. Don't play with me!

128
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:01,523
I can't believe him.

129
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,232
What's that?

130
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:09,297
It seems a bit different then
the Dark Undulation.

131
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,871
- But everyone must be in there!
- Yeah.

132
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:24,182
Let's go, Natsuki!

133
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,684
Roger!

134
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:54,945
I'm slipping!

135
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:58,122
Stay still! I'll lift you up.

136
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:01,155
It's fine, I'll climb myself.

137
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:05,127
No, I'm fine. Wait, stop!

138
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:10,063
That wasn't very nice.

139
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:17,407
Miyuri! Mafuyu!

140
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,043
Miss Taeko!

141
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,645
It's sucking energy from everyone!

142
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,008
That's right.

143
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:34,156
This is the other Seed that fell
from the magical kingdom of Ever Green.

144
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:39,230
But it looks like this place
had too little energy for it to grow.

145
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:43,334
So that's why, it's showing dreams
to people and using that as energy.

146
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:46,136
So then, where's the kidnapped people?

147
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:49,334
Probably at the bottom of this lake.

148
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:51,104
No way.

149
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:53,139
That's unforgivable!

150
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:57,539
Don't be so hasty.
You're opponent today isn't me.

151
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,722
- Nami! Tsuyoshi!
- So you're safe!

152
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:11,988
Of course, my desire
is to be with you, Natsuki.

153
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,930
Nami, her heart's been stolen
by the Dark Undulation!

154
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,528
Natsuki! Time to transform!

155
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:21,899
Okay!

156
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:34,442
Burning with eternal love!

157
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:38,047
The crimson warrior!

158
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:40,751
Magical Angel Carmine!

159
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:52,193
Carmine Eco-Shower!

160
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:58,105
How's that?

161
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:00,610
You did it, nice job!

162
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:02,780
Or did you?

163
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:09,086
The Eco-Shower didn't work?

164
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,479
That can't be!

165
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,128
Too bad, wasn't it?

166
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,872
Those two aren't under the control
of the Dark Undulation.

167
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:30,431
They're not under control?

168
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:34,912
That's right. The Dark Power
is merely lending them power.

169
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,312
To fulfill their desires.

170
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,340
Desires?

171
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,784
You call yourself the warrior of love...

172
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:46,514
and yet you don't know how
to love one another.

173
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,458
- What do you mean?
- You still don't get it!

174
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:51,962
I love you, Chihaya.

175
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:55,125
He became like this all because
you didn't realize his feelings.

176
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:56,230
No way!

177
00:20:56,702 --> 00:21:00,035
And you know Nami's feelings, don't you?

178
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,605
It wasn't me, she forcefully
injected magic into me!

179
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:13,217
That's my present.
Go make Nami's wishes come true.

180
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:14,775
Natsuki!

181
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:19,723
Natsuki, love me.

182
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:45,140
That was nothing.

183
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:50,112
The warrior of love, losing to love.
How ironic is that?

184
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:10,837
Tsuyoshi, stop it! I'm begging you!

185
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,602
Love.

186
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:17,138
Carmine is the warrior of love.

187
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:20,284
Only the power of love
can save everyone.

188
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:23,210
No way! What can I do?

189
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,317
I got it, Chihaya!

190
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:31,318
What?

191
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,901
Nami, there's no way I can ever love you.

192
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:39,868
But I can teach you how to love!

193
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:49,876
It's so different from before.

194
00:22:57,656 --> 00:23:00,989
He's in pain because I never noticed him.

195
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,657
I'm sorry, Tsuyoshi.

196
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:13,528
I wasn't able to realize your feelings for me.

197
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:17,707
You loved me so much
you became like this.

198
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:21,605
It's okay, Tsuyoshi. Make love to me.

199
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:23,613
I'll show you inside.

200
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:26,580
I'll show you what love feels like.

201
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:48,838
That's the end of that.

202
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:00,109
Thank goodness everyone was safe.

203
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:05,014
Yeah, but what was wrong with
Tsuyoshi that time?

204
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,819
He probably figured it out.

205
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:09,152
That it's not love if it's by force.

206
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:11,552
Yeah, you're right.

207
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:16,133
Hey Carmine, why are you not
reverting back to yourself?

208
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:17,792
The battle's over.

209
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:22,434
I was thinking if I should do you.

210
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:24,331
"Do me," you say?

211
00:24:27,446 --> 00:24:29,812
Didn't you tell me
that you like them really big?

212
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:32,640
You see, I may be in this form...

213
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:36,015
but as long as you
call me Chihaya, I'm okay.

214
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,982
How is it? Feel good?

215
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,821
Hell yeah!

216
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:44,519
Really?

217
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:56,471
It's okay, give me your come
on my breasts.

218
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:05,443
How's that? You satisfied?

219
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:08,816
- Incredible.
- You wanted me to do this?

220
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:11,713
I'm sorry, If it was that good...

221
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:16,723
it would be nice if I could do it all the time.
You want me to do it again?

222
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:21,255
As long as you call me
Chihaya, I'm happy.

223
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:23,465
I'm happy.

224
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:25,258
I'm happy.

225
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:29,334
I want to come inside of you, Chihaya.

226
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:31,299
Natsuki.

227
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:35,112
You called me Chihaya,
I heard you say it.

228
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:39,307
Of course. That's because
you're the Chihaya I know and love.

229
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:41,909
I'm so happy.

230
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:11,541
Please, don't stop,
give it to me to the end.

231
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:27,061
Please say it!

232
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,398
Say my name!

233
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:30,863
Chihaya!

234
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:36,898
Natsuki!

235
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:38,541
What?

236
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:42,404
- I felt like saying it.
- Why you! I'll tickle you!

237
00:26:42,614 --> 00:26:43,740
Quit it!

238
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,682
What's wrong?

239
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:48,276
Come to think of it, that last time.

240
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:50,987
Why weren't you at full power?

241
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:55,416
You punk, you didn't!
