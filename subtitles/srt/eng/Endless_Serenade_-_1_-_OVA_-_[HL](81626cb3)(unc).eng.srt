1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,363
Endless Serenade

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:09,973
Satsuki!

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,374
Satsuki!

4
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,903
Can you take over the register, please?

5
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:17,141
Oh. Is it that time already Yuji?

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,219
Uh... uhh...

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,617
It's all right, Yuji. Don't be so shy.

8
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:30,590
Uh... Satsuki!

9
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:31,886
What is it?

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,525
I... I...

11
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,665
Ever since that day my brother
introduced you to me, I...

12
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,231
I've been in love with you!!

13
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,001
Huh?

14
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,174
Miki... Where did Satsuki go?

15
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,779
I don't know.

16
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,927
Hey, Miki! What are you doing!?
Open the door!

17
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,460
If I don't hurry, Satsuki is...

18
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,633
Satsuki, I love you.

19
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,467
I love you more than anything.

20
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,215
Me... Me too...

21
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,152
Huh? You're so wet already.
You were always such a pervert.

22
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:34,625
But... But... I was so lonely.
Ryoichi, you just left me so suddenly.

23
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,629
That's right! That's what happened...

24
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,156
It's been almost a year. I'm sorry.

25
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,834
Oh yes!! It feels so good, Ryoichi!

26
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,336
Yes, Satsuki! It feels really good!

27
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,319
It's wonderful. All the way... all the
way... I can feel it all the way in me!!

28
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,683
Satsuki, you're amazing! It feels great!

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,094
Umm...

30
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:16,331
What?

31
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,802
If you have something to say, just say it!

32
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,833
Don't I always tell you that at the store?

33
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,605
Yuji? Are you really in love with Satsuki?

34
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:33,946
Of course I am!! I'm absolutely
in love with Satsuki!!

35
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,453
<i>My name is Yuji Mikage.</i>

36
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:14,525
<i>I'm a full-time college student, but right now
my job is the most important thing to me.</i>

37
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,326
Oh! Good morning boss!

38
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,732
Don't call me boss in the store.

39
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,037
S-sorry.

40
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,779
<i>Let me introduce him. He's Makoto Amano.</i>

41
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,647
<i>He's an underclassman from the same college.</i>

42
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,616
<i>He's the new guy that's
only been here for a month.</i>

43
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,650
<i>For some odd reason he looks up to me
and calls me boss. He's kind of a goofy kid.</i>

44
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,048
Good morning!!

45
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:44,790
Hey?

46
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,921
Were you working today?

47
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,229
I'm on my way to school but I was
thinking about getting a bite to eat.

48
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,664
<i>She's Kurumi Kagura.</i>

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,970
<i>She started to work here around the same
time as Makoto, so she's a newcomer too.</i>

50
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:04,967
<i>She's a hard worker but she does things that are
completely unexpected, so it really worries me.</i>

51
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,279
You're late, Yuji!! Late! Late!!

52
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,173
S-sorry!

53
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:17,890
<i>She's the woman who was in my dream, and
is also the owner of this store. Satsuki Miné.</i>

54
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:24,453
<i>A year ago my brother died in an auto
accident and she was his fiancée.</i>

55
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,331
<i>Actually, my brother and Satsuki were
supposed to start this store together.</i>

56
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,140
<i>She could have voided the
contract, but she wanted...</i>

57
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,109
<i>... to carry out my brother's
wish, and opened the store.</i>

58
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:42,581
<i>As I watched Satsuki come to terms with my
brother's death, I became atracted to her.</i>

59
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,643
<i>And as we worked together,
my simple admiration for her...</i>

60
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,952
<i>... slowly but surely, had turned into love.</i>

61
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,987
Thank you very much! Please come again!

62
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,865
<i>Although Satsuki is cheerful
and is the ideal storefront girl...</i>

63
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,869
<i>... her business skills as an
owner were questionable.</i>

64
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,508
<i>So by me taking charge of the entire
background managerial workload...</i>

65
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,339
<i>... the store is somewhat able to stay afloat.</i>

66
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,085
Oh. Morning!

67
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,211
Good morning.

68
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,046
<i>She's Miki Asou, who was also in my dreams.</i>

69
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,982
<i>She is one of the part-timers but...</i>

70
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,456
By the way Miki...

71
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,825
Did you make a checklist for the new products?

72
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,524
The file is in the computer.

73
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,532
<i>Out of all the part-timers,
she's been here the longest...</i>

74
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,972
<i>... so she knows the ropes of the job really well.</i>

75
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,704
<i>As for me, I'd like to get along with her but...</i>

76
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,376
<i>... as a convenience store worker
she has a crucial problem.</i>

77
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:01,450
What the hell is that attitude!? You
call that customer service!? Eh?

78
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,184
Huh?

79
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,096
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:03,696
Wha?!? Are you fucking with me!?
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,924
Wha?!? Are you fucking with me!?

82
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,758
Hey, get me the manager!
I want to speak to a manager!

83
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,061
I'm wasting my time with you!

84
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,340
Excuse me. What's the matter?
Is there something wrong?

85
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,677
You have got to be kidding me!
Who does she think she is!?

86
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,646
You call this attitude friendly customer service?

87
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,544
I'm very sorry. Come on!
Apologize to the customer!

88
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,049
I'm really very sorry.

89
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,826
W-we're really sorry!

90
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:39,365
<i>Yes... She's flawless with the office work but...</i>

91
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,595
<i>... as for customer service, she
was absolutely terrible at it!</i>

92
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,529
<i>She's been working for almost a year but...</i>

93
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,598
<i>... every now and then, she ends
up angering a customer like today.</i>

94
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,741
Cheerfully!

95
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,278
With a happy face!!

96
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,540
Smile! Smile!!

97
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,016
This is not good.

98
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,686
You've been working here for almost a year.

99
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,090
Why can't you do something that's so simple?

100
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:06,752
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,825
It's going to affect the store's image.

102
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,987
You can't keep this up.

103
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,793
Anyway be careful, will you?

104
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:20,798
The biggest mistake you can make is to upset
a customer. You understand that, right?

105
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,131
Yes...

106
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,376
Well, go back to the register for now.

107
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,536
Yes...

108
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,075
She's a problem...

109
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,615
Yes...

110
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,621
It feels kind of good. I wonder why...

111
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,828
Miki! What are you doing? Why are you?!?

112
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,668
I know it's a dream, but what am I thinking?

113
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,636
Geez! This is what a middle school kid does...

114
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,906
Am I really that horny?

115
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,710
I can't believe I'm having
wet dreams about Miki too...

116
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:50,925
But why is she in so many of my dreams?

117
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,733
<i>I wish Satsuki would be my girlfriend.</i>

118
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:02,338
<i>We'd be having sex every day, I
wouldn't have time to have wet dreams.</i>

119
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:04,770
Hello!

120
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,710
Huh? I thought today was your day off?

121
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,879
Yeah, but I wanted to talk to
Kurumi about something so?

122
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,818
She's taking a break in the back room.

123
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,616
Please excuse me then.

124
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,824
Do you think Makoto and Kurumi are dating?

125
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,188
Huh? Oh, no way.

126
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,862
I don't think Kurumi would
think twice about Makoto.

127
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,963
You really think so? I think he's pretty cute.

128
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,973
No way! He never gets girls!

129
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,834
Wow, Kurumi.

130
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:45,316
Stop it! The managers are here!
We can't be doing this here.

131
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,082
Don't worry.

132
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,889
It's busy right now so no one will come in.

133
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:52,992
O-ok.

134
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,620
It smells a little sweaty
because you've been working.

135
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,328
Don't say that!! That's so embarrassing!

136
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,390
But it kind of turns me on too.

137
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:11,238
Yes. My body... It's getting
hot in there! It feels so good!!

138
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,938
A change of scenery makes
it even more exciting!

139
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,481
It's in me! I can feel your
cock all the way inside!!

140
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:23,453
Kurumi, you're such a pervert, it's great.

141
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,358
Harder! Harder!

142
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:25,524
Ok then! How about this!?
Harder! Harder!

143
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,321
Ok then! How about this!?

144
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,196
Thank you so much!!

145
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,908
I wonder what Kurumi is doing?

146
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,206
There's going to be a wave of customers soon.

147
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,005
You're right. I'll go get her.

148
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,746
Kurumi. We need you to
come to the register soon...

149
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,588
Ah Yuhi! I'ff we vright dhere!
(Ah, Yuji! I'll be right there!)

150
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,354
Thank you very much!

151
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,022
Umm... Please keep it a secret from Satsuki.

152
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,236
How could I tell her something like that!?

153
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,532
Promise you won't do it again!

154
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,104
Ok!

155
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,269
When did you guys start dating?

156
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,409
A-about two weeks ago.

157
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:27,082
Oh no! Boss, did you have your eye on Kurumi?

158
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,922
No, I didn't. Trust me.

159
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,583
Thank God!

160
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,791
As your devotee, it would've
been horrible of me...

161
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,558
...to steal the boss' girl!

162
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:43,534
<i>No. I really could have
cared less about Kurumi.</i>

163
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:48,397
<i>But while I'm dealing with
these miserable emotions...</i>

164
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:53,640
<i>Thinking that this dumb-looking
kid is living a lovey-dovey life...</i>

165
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,877
<i>... is pissing me off, but it also
makes me feel even more lonely.</i>

166
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:38,922
Oh Yuji, your cock is hard already.

167
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,483
Satsuki...

168
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,822
Well? Does it feel good?

169
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,725
Yes. It feels really good Satsuki.

170
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,295
It feels really fantastic...

171
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,738
Yes, Yuji. You're doing great.

172
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,717
Satsuki... I...

173
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,948
Go ahead Yuji. I want you in me...

174
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:20,355
It's in me! You're in me, Yuji!

175
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,669
Oh my God! Oh yes! It's so numbing!

176
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,642
It feels great. You're amazing Satsuki!

177
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,678
More! I want it harder!

178
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,282
Satsuki! Satsuki! I love
you! I'm in love with you!

179
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:41,379
Me... me too. Yuji, will you
always... always stay by my side?

180
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:46,991
Of course! Whatever happens, I'll
never let you feel lonely ever again!

181
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,855
Really? You promise?

182
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,960
Satsuki. I can't hold it anymore!

183
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,030
Go ahead. Come in me! Give it to me.

184
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,241
Hello?

185
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,519
<i>Hello. This is Miki.</i>

186
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,413
Oh, it's you.

187
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,121
I was just getting into it too...

188
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,926
<i>What?</i>

189
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,759
Oh nothing.

190
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,066
What's wrong? Did something
happen at the store?

191
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,695
<i>The main office contacted us about
the list of the items on order...</i>

192
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,603
Isn't Satsuki there?

193
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,801
Oh right... She won't be able to do it.

194
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,710
Ok. Can you read it to me?

195
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,037
Uh-huh.

196
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,070
Uh-huh.

197
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:43,380
Uh-huh.

198
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,077
<i>I got it. Anything else?</i>

199
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,119
N-no, that's it.

200
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:52,948
Umm... Sorry to call when
you're not working. Good bye.

201
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,390
I don't feel like doing it anymore.

202
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,493
It was work related so it can't be helped but...

203
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,801
All we have to do now is send out the letters
to our relatives and figure out who's coming.

204
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,314
Great job, Yuji.

205
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:21,248
Our parents are gone, so it's my duty to
hold a memorial service for my brother.

206
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,122
I'm here too you know!

207
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:27,058
Oh... I'm sorry. You're right.

208
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,265
<i>It's great to have Satsuki
around me, but Ryoichi is gone.</i>

209
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,256
<i>I can't make her stay forever.</i>

210
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:37,658
Satsuki!

211
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:38,503
Huh?

212
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,472
After this memorial service, please move on.

213
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:47,035
Satsuki, you're still young, so it's okay if
you want to go do something you enjoy.

214
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,144
I'll figure something out about the store.

215
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:50,975
Yuji?

216
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,148
Yes?

217
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,514
Are you sure I can do whatever I want?

218
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,721
Yes... It's not my place to stop you so...

219
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:04,756
Then if it's all right with you, I'd
like to keep working at the store.

220
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:05,822
Huh?

221
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,598
I really enjoy the job.

222
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,766
Or would you rather I didn't?

223
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:16,005
Of course not! I wasn't thinking
that! Of course you can!

224
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,706
Really? Yuji, thank you!

225
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,507
<i>Oh yes! Satsuki's going to stay!</i>

226
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:29,585
<i>As time passes, she'll forget
Ryoichi and fall in love with me!</i>

227
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:31,351
I...

228
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,281
Y-yes?

229
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:38,391
I wasn't able to get married to Ryoichi, but
I think of you as my real younger brother.

230
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,599
I was an only child so I was always really lonely.

231
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,963
I was always envious of people who had siblings.

232
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,201
<i>Younger brother?</i>

233
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,365
What's up with Miki? She's going
to karaoke by herself this early?

234
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:11,889
Ever since I was little I've been shy, and
I've had trouble interacting with people.

235
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:17,487
But I thought it couldn't stay like
this, and I've tried to overcome it.

236
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,424
I deliberately chose jobs
involving customer service but...

237
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:25,234
Everywhere I went it didn't go
well and I kept getting fired.

238
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,499
I'm at the end of my rope!

239
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,004
If I get fired from this job...

240
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,478
As is, I'm dealing with self-confidence issues.

241
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,574
I feel like someone who's
completely incompetent socially.

242
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,611
So that's what it was...

243
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:43,988
Please! I'll work hard so I can
provide better customer service...

244
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,817
Please, don't fire me!

245
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,350
Please!!

246
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,319
Ok.

247
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:57,960
I don't know how Satsuki
feels, but I'll back you up.

248
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,264
Don't give up and let's work through it together!

249
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:05,468
Most of your hours overlap with mine,
so if we work together it'll be all right.

250
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,776
Come on, stop crying. It'll be all right!

251
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,638
Y-yes.

252
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:16,785
I feel so much better after
talking to you about my shyness.

253
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:21,450
I feel like everything will work
out. Thank you so much.

254
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,160
<i>I didn't know how cute Miki
looked when she smiled.</i>

255
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,104
<i>Satsuki only sees me as her younger brother.</i>

256
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,413
<i>She'll never accept my feelings.</i>

257
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,257
N-no!

258
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,415
<i>Looking back, Miki and I have been
working together for almost a year.</i>

259
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,319
<i>But there weren't any special
emotions between us.</i>

260
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,123
<i>And I've wondered why she
decided to have sex with me...</i>

261
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,053
<i>Miki who has trouble interacting with people.</i>

262
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,764
<i>Maybe she was lonely from
being by herself all the time?</i>

263
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,099
<i>I'm a terrible guy.</i>

264
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,430
<i>I'm taking advantage of her emotional
insecurity to fill my own lonely void.</i>

265
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,702
Yuji... I... I...

266
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,260
<i>But I wonder what this peaceful feeling is?</i>

267
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,996
<i>What is this emotion that
makes her feel so dear to me?</i>

268
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,329
<i>Sympathy perhaps?</i>

269
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:20,403
<i>A litle sympathy for Miki's sense of courage
to keep trying to reach out to others.</i>

270
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:21,471
<i>But?</i>

271
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:27,244
<i>But right now we are...
We are here, spending time together.</i>

272
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,716
<i>And this time is somehow...</i>

273
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,387
<i>Somehow...</i>

274
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,271
S-sorry.

275
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:00,579
It's all right. I'm not expecting
you to start dating me.

276
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,048
You're in love with Satsuki, right?

277
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,952
I've known that you've been
watching Satsuki the entire time.

278
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:18,228
The two of you, you share the
memory of your late brother.

279
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,064
There's no one who can come between you two.

280
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,569
So Yuji...

281
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,639
You go win Satsuki's heart and...

282
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,105
...make sure you become a couple!

283
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,548
<i>Miki knew...</i>

284
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,594
<i>... that it was only an act of two lonely
people mending each other's lonely hearts.</i>

285
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,927
<i>And still, Miki forgave me.</i>

286
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:54,364
<i>By accepting it herself, she forgave me.</i>

287
00:22:55,607 --> 00:23:00,340
<i>So I thought it was absolutely
necessary to tell Satsuki how I felt.</i>

288
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,443
<i>And to repay her efforts for
smiling and wishing me luck.</i>

289
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,611
Miné

290
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,385
Satsuki?

291
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,697
<i>S- Satsuki... wow. She's really into it.</i>

292
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,180
I... I can't anymore!

293
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,291
Ryoichi...

294
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,862
<i>I didn't know! I had no idea!</i>

295
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:42,302
<i>A year... It's been a year and Satsuki's
feelings for Ryoichi are still that strong!?</i>

296
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,878
<i>That night really hit me hard.</i>

297
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,313
<i>And because of it, I've developed a fever.</i>

298
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:53,013
<i>I was bedridden, which hasn't
happened in years, and I had to
take off from school and work.</i>

299
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,394
Uh-huh. Yeah...

300
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:00,431
So that's the deal. Sorry, but if you
can take care of it, I'd appreciate it.

301
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:01,992
S-sure...

302
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:06,003
Um... Get well soon.

303
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,733
Uh-huh. Thanks.

304
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:10,399
Talk to you later.

305
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:24,540
<i>This past year, Satsuki convenience store
was the most important thing to me.</i>

306
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,817
<i>For my brother's wishes and for
the prosperity of the store...</i>

307
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:32,146
<i>... everyday I cracked the
whip to my fatigued body.</i>

308
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:38,790
<i>Perhaps no one else but Miki really
cared for me this entire time?</i>

309
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,232
<i>Although her customer
service was questionable...</i>

310
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:45,437
<i>... she was the only one
who paid extra atention...</i>

311
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,406
<i>... to the merchandise and
cleanliness of the store.</i>

312
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,577
<i>It's true that I've worked hard up until now...</i>

313
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,546
<i>... because of my feelings for
Satsuki and to be helpful but...</i>

314
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,941
<i>... but without Miki's help, today's
success couldn't have been possible.</i>

315
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:06,954
<i>Miki... The most important
thing to me could be...</i>

316
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,225
Oh, Yuji!

317
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:15,866
Good morning.

318
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,366
Are you feeling better?

319
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,205
Yes.

320
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:24,539
You don't have to push yourself.
Miki will take your night shifts.

321
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:28,437
Yes... but I can't just lie in bed forever so...

322
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:34,413
Really? Well, it would be
great to have you here but...

323
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:36,481
Miki!

324
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,032
You get off at five, right?

325
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,827
I'll be waiting for you at the park.

326
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,241
I wonder what's up with Yuji?

327
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,540
I was such an idiot.

328
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,348
I finally just realized today
who is really important to me.

329
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,113
Yuji...

330
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,353
I love you, Miki.

331
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,849
I want you to always be near me.

332
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:49,552
Miki...

333
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,155
I... me too...

334
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,699
I've loved you... for so long Yuji.

335
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,059
Yuji.

336
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,606
Miki, I love you.

337
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:43,981
I love...

338
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,644
...you too.

339
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,518
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes...

340
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:01,898
Miki...

341
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:02,990
I love you...

342
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,343
Miki... I... I can't...

343
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,240
Oh yes! Yuji, come with me...

344
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:40,928
What's wrong?

345
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,633
It's nothing...

346
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,040
Nothing at all...
