1
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,879
The blissful source of the greatness
of the universe.

2
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,609
If we take control of that...

3
00:00:23,683 --> 00:00:25,981
...we can cross time and space...

4
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:30,455
...and manipulate the evil passions
of all people at will.

5
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:38,390
Tell us where the passage leading
to the Shikima brain is?

6
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:40,955
I don't know! Even if I did, I
wouldn't tell you!

7
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:43,465
Give in! Shikima King!

8
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:45,367
Hold it!

9
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,770
Fubuki!

10
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:49,903
Yaku!

11
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:52,503
Miko Mido!

12
00:00:52,578 --> 00:00:56,070
Glory to the Mahoroba!

13
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,911
Ryokuga!

14
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,243
That's so good...!

15
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,718
I'm going to cum...!

16
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:11,015
More, more...!

17
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:12,316
Harder!

18
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:14,148
I'm going to cum...!

19
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:17,989
M-Miyu! I can't take it anymore...!

20
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:20,195
No. Not yet!

21
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,826
A little more! I'm about to cum!

22
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:30,840
I can't! This is it!

23
00:02:31,344 --> 00:02:34,472
Cum inside of me! I want all of it!

24
00:02:37,683 --> 00:02:40,151
I want all of it! Cum inside of me!

25
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,846
I want to feel it hot!

26
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:45,190
I'm going to cum! I'm cumming!

27
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:58,067
Hey, you can go again, right?

28
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,298
Look, Miyu! I wish you'd cut it out!

29
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:03,672
How many times do you have to
do it, and in my room!

30
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:05,301
How many times?

31
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:07,471
It's only been twice.

32
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:09,845
Isn't twice enough?

33
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,714
In any case, why do you have to
bring men back to my place?!

34
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:17,620
That's because this is the closest
place to my shooting location.

35
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:19,983
Miyu?

36
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,321
Miko.

37
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:22,486
Father?

38
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:25,156
What are you doing, Miko?

39
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:29,031
Have you found the passage
leading to the Shikima brain?

40
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:34,597
Don't tell me you've forgotten the
importance of the Shikima brain.

41
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,972
I haven't forgotten...

42
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:38,772
...what you told me, Father.

43
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:42,304
The Shikima brain...

44
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:44,372
...from which the entire
universe is controlled...

45
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,216
...is a holy place, considered
to be the origin of space.

46
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,579
If we can control that...

47
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:54,285
...we can cross time and space...

48
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,920
...and manipulate the passions
of all people at will.

49
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:59,362
Although we may have repelled
the Mahoroba clan...

50
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:01,662
...the brain will be the next target.

51
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:05,397
And so, Miko, in order
to protect the brain...

52
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:08,770
...you must find the passage
that leads to it.

53
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:12,335
I'll leave you to find that passage.

54
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:13,878
Well, see you, Miko.

55
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:17,279
I'll be using your bed again.

56
00:04:17,783 --> 00:04:19,648
Hey! Wait a minute, Miyu!

57
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:22,252
We're here!

58
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,691
So, this is Miko's
and this is Yaku's and...

59
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,625
...and this is Fubuki's!

60
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:32,926
Why did you bring a computer
along, Fubuki?

61
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,224
It's about all we can count on now.

62
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:38,134
Nin-Nin, could you
get us refreshments?

63
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:39,571
Sure!

64
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:48,303
This is connected to here...

65
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,871
And then...

66
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:58,419
They're awfully carefree around me.

67
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:01,949
They don't even see me as a man anymore.

68
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:04,827
So, this is what they call a mouse?

69
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:08,594
Come on, Miko. Will you get
serious about this?

70
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:11,159
Have you forgotten the promise
you made to the Shikima King?

71
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:13,705
I haven't forgotten at all!

72
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,434
The Mahoroba clan attacked us...

73
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:17,908
...and we barely managed to fight
them off, but...

74
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:19,140
There!

75
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:22,204
We don't know when the Shikima
brain will be targeted...

76
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,442
...so in order to find
the passage to it...

77
00:05:24,517 --> 00:05:27,782
...we're all hunkered down here
and working hard...

78
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:30,287
...to get as many leads as possible.

79
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,617
And we haven't gotten anywhere.

80
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:36,321
Maybe it's just not possible to find
the passage to the Shikima brain...

81
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:38,158
...just with the three of us.

82
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,096
Grandma's suggestion...

83
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,863
...was to get the survivors of the
Miroku clan to help us, but...

84
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:47,769
...that didn't work out either.

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,070
The Miroku have been
all scattered about...

86
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,303
...like blades of grass.

87
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:56,443
Even if we look for them,
we don't even have one lead.

88
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:57,743
That's right.

89
00:05:57,817 --> 00:06:00,183
That's why we brought a computer.

90
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,451
We'll set up a web site...

91
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:07,014
...with keywords that only those
from the Miroku would understand.

92
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:08,788
These are modern times.

93
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:13,730
Miroku people who can't get in
touch with the clan might access it.

94
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,101
It'll be like killing two birds
with one stone...

95
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,137
...if we can get some leads on the
Shikima brain as well.

96
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,130
You're so amazing, Fubuki!

97
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,233
When did you become such a techie?!

98
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,210
Everybody knows this stuff.

99
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,646
This is the age of information
technology, after all.

100
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:36,112
The mouse makes his way
over the mountain...

101
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:39,090
Stop messing around, Nin-Nin!

102
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:43,960
Do you really think the Miroku
will recognize the web site?

103
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,021
We've got to try it, right?

104
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:48,089
We can keep jumping and
running around in circles...

105
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,260
...but we haven't been able
to get anywhere so far.

106
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:53,828
You're right. It's better than not trying.

107
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:57,865
As for the Miroku clan...
You're Shikima clan, right?

108
00:06:57,943 --> 00:07:01,777
So the only Miroku left that we
know of are Nin-Nin and Yaku.

109
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:04,179
This all because of my negligence.

110
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,512
Anyway...

111
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:09,076
...even if just one from the Miroku
were to access the web site...

112
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:12,921
...that might be enough to give us
a lead to find the Shikima brain.

113
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:16,052
We're going to have to count on
you for this, Fubuki.

114
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:19,859
That's right. We're completely
ignorant about these things.

115
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:21,957
But I have to ask, Miko...

116
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:26,300
...do you have any college friends
who can help us with the web site?

117
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:29,136
Huh? I thought you were going to...

118
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:33,611
I'm still working on the whole
information technology thing.

119
00:07:35,047 --> 00:07:36,776
Click, click... Click.

120
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:41,915
How dare you take advantage
of the situation, Nin-Nin!

121
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:45,222
And so, the way the human brain works...

122
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,919
...is still not clear in many respects.

123
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:49,722
In regard to the function of the brain...

124
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:53,196
...half of it isn't even being
used most of the time.

125
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:57,628
We don't completely understand
the human brain.

126
00:07:57,703 --> 00:07:59,967
The Shikima brain is
more full of mysteries.

127
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:05,102
We can't even figure out how
we're supposed to get there.

128
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:17,383
Miko!

129
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,648
Ruri!

130
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:20,749
I finally got a hold of my brother.

131
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:22,726
He said he'll drop by after
the computer shop.

132
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:23,921
Really?

133
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:26,157
He said he'd be about an hour.

134
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:28,564
Wow, that really helps me out!

135
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:29,828
Thanks, Ruri.

136
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:32,427
Don't mention it.
It's really no big deal.

137
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:35,668
I'm just happy that we could
become friends because of this.

138
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:39,541
I'm happy, too, that we
could become friends.

139
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:41,876
I should ask for help more often.

140
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:50,080
There he is. Maho!

141
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,817
You were awfully quick.

142
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:53,017
Oh, Ruri.

143
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:57,488
What is this sudden feeling I have?

144
00:08:57,563 --> 00:09:01,499
This bittersweet, weird feeling
that I'm overcome with?

145
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:11,970
What is this...?

146
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:21,551
I'm Maho, Ruri's older brother.

147
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:23,779
I've heard a lot about you.

148
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,790
Uh, I'm Miko Mido.

149
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,789
I'm sorry for making you do this.

150
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,157
What's the matter, Miko?
You're blushing.

151
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,924
Maho,just because you
don't meet girls often...

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,560
...doesn't mean you can
have your way with her.

153
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:41,436
How could you say such a thing
in front of your friend?

154
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:44,135
Well, I'll leave the rest with you, Maho.

155
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,906
I've got somewhere
I've got to go to, Miko.

156
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,970
I'll see you on campus tomorrow.

157
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,379
Uh, thanks!

158
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:52,814
But why?

159
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:55,945
I've never met him before.

160
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:58,251
But I feel a fondness toward him.

161
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:06,064
Here we go.

162
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:09,932
You just have to wait for a while...

163
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:13,130
...until the service provider
sets up your account.

164
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,366
What's the matter?

165
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:21,174
Is there something on my face?

166
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,477
Uh, no. Oh, I know...

167
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:25,813
...I'll get you a cold refreshment.

168
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,678
Miko!

169
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:38,995
Uh, I'm sorry.

170
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,209
I'm home!

171
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:56,547
Did you bring someone who's
going to do the web site for us?

172
00:10:57,683 --> 00:10:59,583
What are you two doing?

173
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:12,520
Thank you so much for today.

174
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:17,035
Thanks to you, the other two are
all over the computer now.

175
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:20,994
Well, if that's the sort of help you
need, then call me anytime.

176
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:25,276
Thank you very much.

177
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:29,713
If you have any more trouble
with your computer...

178
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:31,579
...feel free to give me a call.

179
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,277
I appreciate that.

180
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,753
We did it, Miko!

181
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:43,517
I girl who seems like a Miroku
accessed the web site!

182
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:45,086
Really?!

183
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,029
That's right!

184
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,590
I used the keyword, '' Peach
blossom in the land of Miroku.''

185
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,829
And this girl sent in a question
asking whether...

186
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:54,031
...that was a reference to the name
of a Miroku ancestor.

187
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:56,404
As it turns out, she lives
right near here.

188
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:59,205
Nin-Nin's gone out to get her.

189
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,475
It was awfully easy finding
someone from the Miroku clan.

190
00:12:03,282 --> 00:12:04,510
I'm back!

191
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,347
Come on in. Don't be shy.

192
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:09,080
Hello!

193
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,483
Miss Miko!

194
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:16,022
Are you the one who
got in touch with us...

195
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:18,256
...through our new web site?

196
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,456
That's right.

197
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,125
I'm Kanako, Miss Miko.

198
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,463
Miss Miko?!

199
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,629
This has always been
a dream of mine.

200
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:32,166
The day I would be summoned
by the great Miko Mido of the Miroku.

201
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,553
Miss Miko!

202
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,749
Cut it out!

203
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,285
Before my grandmother died...

204
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:26,763
...she had trained me
in the carnal arts...

205
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:28,663
...so that one day I'd be of some use...

206
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,635
...and able to offer my services
to the Mido family of the Miroku clan.

207
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:34,036
You've been training in
the carnal arts as well?

208
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,471
That's right.

209
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:40,472
But normally I'm a student
at a nursing college.

210
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:41,911
Kanako...

211
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,778
And I didn't know
how to get in touch...

212
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,410
...with the main house
of the Miroku clan...

213
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:49,716
...so, I've been alone all this time.

214
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,653
Is that right?

215
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:53,416
I'm so sorry.

216
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:56,325
I wasn't even aware that someone
like you was out there.

217
00:13:56,395 --> 00:13:59,762
But I just happened to come
across a web site...

218
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:02,858
...and when I saw that keyword
only a Miroku would catch...

219
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:05,165
...I thought,just maybe this time...!

220
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:07,935
And then just like in my dream...

221
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:13,000
...I get to meet the adorable Miss
Miko Mido of the Miroku clan!

222
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:15,342
Miss Miko!

223
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:18,142
Kanako! I'm really not
into that sort of thing!

224
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:21,948
I wish you'd call me lover, Miss Mido!

225
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,578
Look, you...!

226
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,748
Miss Miko!

227
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,018
No...!

228
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:30,323
Why don't you just become
her big sister?

229
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:34,798
I suppose. Experience is the most
important thing, after all.

230
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,690
You two are horrible!

231
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:40,168
How can you think such a thing?!

232
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:56,955
What are you going to do, Maho?

233
00:14:57,122 --> 00:14:59,750
Are you going to leave Miko Mido alone?

234
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:04,023
No.

235
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:07,327
Anyone who tries to get
near the Shikima brain...

236
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,334
...I cannot let alone,
no matter who they are.

237
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,732
I'll lure her into the usual place,
and eliminate her.

238
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:18,241
I see. Sounds all right to me.

239
00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:33,354
So, we shall cross paths again.

240
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:48,760
Gimme a break!

241
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:52,860
Fubuki!

242
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:55,969
Tentacles from the computer?!

243
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,206
Yaku! Fubuki!

244
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:03,442
Look, Kanako...

245
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,848
Fubuki! How...?!

246
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,486
Fubuki!

247
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:18,995
Fubuki, what just happened now?!

248
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:21,658
It happened while I was in the shower.

249
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,758
Why would tentacles come out
of the computer?

250
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:27,896
It looks like she'll be all right.

251
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:30,737
But she doesn't seem to be conscious...

252
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:33,642
...it's like she's watching a dream
while she's awake.

253
00:17:33,712 --> 00:17:35,509
That's what it looks like to me.

254
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,539
There's a specialist doctor at the
hospital where I'm interning.

255
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:42,815
The doctor's doing research
on sleep treatments.

256
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:44,913
I think we should take
her there right away!

257
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,719
Fubuki...

258
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:50,888
Anyway, we're going have to get
her to regain consciousness.

259
00:17:50,963 --> 00:17:52,191
Right.

260
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:55,563
Kanako, do you think we can ask
that doctor to help us?

261
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:57,898
All right! I'll try to get a hold of her!

262
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,632
Nin-Nin, call an ambulance right away!

263
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:01,832
Right...

264
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:14,851
Just hang on, Fubuki!

265
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,718
She's probably being molested
in her dream.

266
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:30,230
If she's being molested in her
dream, there's nothing we can do.

267
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:31,792
Yes.

268
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,704
Kanako, do you think Fubuki
will be normal again?

269
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:39,369
I'm sure the doctor I'm interning
for can help her!

270
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:43,437
She's a world-famous scientist in
the field of sleep treatment.

271
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:48,817
She's highly respected by serious
researchers all across the country.

272
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:49,876
I see.

273
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:56,890
I just gave her a sedative.

274
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:59,362
She'll rest for a while.

275
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,867
I'll take this opportunity to determine
what is tormenting her.

276
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,903
Can you figure out what
kind of dream she's having?

277
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:06,960
Yes.

278
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,533
There are two different types of sleep:
REM sleep and non-REM sleep.

279
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,407
Fubuki is now dreaming
in a non-REM sleep state.

280
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,779
These dreams are called
hallucinatory dreams...

281
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,148
...and they seem very close to reality.

282
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:22,345
Hallucinatory dreams?

283
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:23,786
Yes.

284
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:26,847
World famous scientists,
like Nobel laureates...

285
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:29,223
...who make major scientific discoveries...

286
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:32,695
...or great minds who discover
truths about life and the universe...

287
00:19:32,764 --> 00:19:37,064
...have often awakened from
hallucinatory dreams...

288
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:41,799
...gaining insights into truths that
they later reveal to the world.

289
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:44,967
Then, what Fubuki's seeing right now is...

290
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:50,106
...an experience as she nears what
it is that she is trying to discover.

291
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:53,276
You could say that it's like trial
run taking place in reality.

292
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:55,045
Miko...

293
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,146
Perhaps Fubuki's desire to find the
passage to the Shikima brain...

294
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:02,023
...has brought on the carnal
demons tormenting her.

295
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:06,262
Doctor, please bring Fubuki back
to consciousness.

296
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,798
I understand.

297
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:10,699
I'll do the best that I can.

298
00:20:15,574 --> 00:20:17,007
Hello, this is Miko.

299
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:18,770
Hi, it's Maho.

300
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,539
Oh, Maho.

301
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:22,739
Miko, do you think we can meet?

302
00:20:22,814 --> 00:20:23,644
Huh?

303
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:26,206
There's something I really
want to show you, Miko.

304
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:29,981
But I can't really leave where I am.

305
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:32,250
I'll send you an e-mail with the address.

306
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:33,814
I hope you come.

307
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:35,792
It's really important. I'll be waiting.

308
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,489
Uh, wait! Hello? Maho? Hello? Maho?

309
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:39,962
What's the matter, Miko?

310
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:43,499
Maho, who created that web site
for us the other day...

311
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:47,595
...insists on meeting me right away.

312
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:50,072
He said there's something
important he wants to show me.

313
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:52,109
He sounded really tense.

314
00:20:52,177 --> 00:20:53,701
I understand, Miko.

315
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:55,871
I'll watch things here.

316
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:58,006
But, Fubuki's...

317
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,847
It'll be okay. Don't you worry.

318
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,444
I'll stick around and watch over Fubuki.

319
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:05,547
Yaku...

320
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:08,787
Thank you. I'll leave you with Fubuki.

321
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:11,852
Miss Miko!

322
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,522
Sorry to keep you waiting!

323
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:16,692
Kanako, I want you to stay here
with Fubuki.

324
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:21,137
Oh, Miss Miko.
Are you going somewhere?

325
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:22,764
I don't want you to go.

326
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:25,708
I don't want to be apart from you!

327
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:27,677
Let me go with you.

328
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,306
Kanako, I'm asking you...

329
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:33,977
You're the only one I can trust
to watch over Fubuki.

330
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:38,920
Okay. If that's what you want,
I will obey you.

331
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:46,420
Now, let's see what this
nightmare is all about.

332
00:21:46,498 --> 00:21:48,625
I really hope you can do it.

333
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:54,932
Fubuki, where are you right now?

334
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,305
Inside the great hall.

335
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,584
An appropriate sacrifice
to open up the passage.

336
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,993
I'm sure even the Shikima
will be satisfied with this.

337
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:22,694
What? What are these people
talking about?

338
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:28,029
We can tell with how she was
writhing in pleasure before.

339
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:32,774
We'll have to get her nice and wet
before we open the passage.

340
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:35,404
We'll summon the Shikima
with her moaning.

341
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,507
We'll have to make preparations
before that.

342
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:42,345
Summon the Shikima?

343
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,650
Who are you people, anyway?!

344
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,254
Wh-What are you doing to me?!

345
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,839
Who on earth are you people?!

346
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:10,847
Why are you doing this? Where am I?!

347
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:21,749
- Doctor!
- Are you all right, Fubuki?!

348
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:26,195
Yaku, I want you to tune into
Fubuki's hallucinatory dream.

349
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:28,824
Tune into Fubuki's hallucinatory dream?

350
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,492
Is that even possible?

351
00:23:30,568 --> 00:23:32,331
This is an emergency.

352
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:36,135
If the torment of this hallucinatory
dream continues much longer...

353
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,641
...she'll be damaged psychologically.

354
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,679
Someone has to tune into her
hallucinatory dream...

355
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:44,579
...and go in and save her from it.

356
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:46,014
I understand!

357
00:23:52,257 --> 00:23:53,986
Miko, get on the back.

358
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,617
Maho!

359
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:02,356
I didn't think you would actually
catch the last train.

360
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:04,459
I half didn't expect you to show up.

361
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:07,267
I'm so happy we are
meeting again, Miko.

362
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:09,395
Maho...

363
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:13,909
But why do I feel this way?

364
00:24:13,978 --> 00:24:17,345
Why do I feel this way toward Maho?

365
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:28,417
What is this place, Maho?

366
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:44,672
Wh-What's that?!

367
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:08,263
Wh-Where are we?
What's happened to us?!

368
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:11,094
Maho...!

369
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:21,811
Stop! Please, no! No!

370
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,471
Fubuki!

371
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,109
Hang on, Miko!

372
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:30,476
Shikima are present as stipulated
in the contract.

373
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:33,619
Take the other one and
offer it up as a sacrifice!

374
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:41,622
Miko!

375
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:44,663
Maho!

376
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:47,728
Stop this! I am the daughter
of the Shikima King!

377
00:25:47,806 --> 00:25:50,297
Never heard of him!

378
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:53,640
Who does she think she is?

379
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:57,613
Nice and tight. This is quality pussy!

380
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,014
How could they not know Father?

381
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:03,986
Aren't they Shikima?
Where on earth is this?

382
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:11,222
Miko!

383
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:14,390
No! Don't look, Maho!

384
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:15,660
No!

385
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:19,534
No!

386
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:35,919
No, Miko. I mustn't get aroused.

387
00:26:35,987 --> 00:26:39,787
Maho's watching. I can take
at least this much...

388
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:45,720
N-No...! Please, I beg you...!

389
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:48,095
Don't do this to me anymore!

390
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:02,875
No, please! Not there!

391
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:04,244
Not in front of Maho!

392
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:07,011
Please, not in front of Maho!

393
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:10,078
No!

394
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:33,903
I'm going to cum... I'm going to cum...
I'm going to cum!

395
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:36,411
Miko!

396
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:39,278
No! Please don't watch, Maho!

397
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,284
I beg you!

398
00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:56,364
No...! I'm going to cum!
I'm going to cum!

399
00:27:56,434 --> 00:27:58,766
I'm cumming!

400
00:28:04,175 --> 00:28:05,540
Miko!

401
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:07,970
Maho...

402
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:05,254
Coming up next,
La Blue Girl Returns Episode 4.

403
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:06,921
Don't miss it!
