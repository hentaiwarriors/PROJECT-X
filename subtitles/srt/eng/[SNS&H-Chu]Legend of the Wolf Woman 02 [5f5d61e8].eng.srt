1
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,340
Don't move!

2
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,490
Raise your hands and put
them behind your head.

3
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,520
Walk toward me slowly.

4
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,330
Get down on your knees, now!

5
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,090
Legend of the Wolf Woman

6
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,020
Legend of the Wolf Woman
Part Two

7
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,760
What?

8
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,560
I'm from the same tribe as Kata.

9
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,070
My name is Mustang.

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,260
How do you know that she's safe now?

11
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,240
I can tell because we all are
connected deep inside our souls.

12
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,410
But...

13
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,640
But?

14
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,310
It seems like she's being
haunted by a terrible dream.

15
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,420
And so is this city...

16
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,750
Yahoo!

17
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,970
Don't lose them!

18
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,600
Go check the containers, Frank!

19
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,890
You bastard!

20
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,360
I see one!

21
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,060
Damn it, stay still!

22
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,510
I can't aim...

23
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,970
Where did the other one go?

24
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,230
B-Brian?

25
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,700
It can't be!

26
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,310
No, it can't be!

27
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,080
Are you all right, Linda?

28
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,720
He went down there! Chase
them to the front door!

29
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,170
Kaboom!

30
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,310
What happened?

31
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,220
Oh my God, what is this?

32
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,230
They are human beings...

33
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,690
It looks worse than minced meat...

34
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,840
Yes? Uh, okay...

35
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,570
This is an emergency broadcast...

36
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,350
This video you're watching now has
not been tampered with in any way.

37
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,310
It's unbelievable!

38
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,120
It is not a fake, this
is a live broadcast.

39
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,760
People nearby, please stay
calm and remain inside your homes.

40
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,360
It's hard to believe, but this is real!

41
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,940
Where are they from? Why are they
here?

42
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,070
Colonel! Why did you blow them up?

43
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,640
We almost caught them!

44
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,880
What on earth are you thinking?

45
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,010
Remember those monsters were
originally human beings!

46
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,780
What are you talking about?

47
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,820
All I did was blow up the monsters
because you police are so unreliable.

48
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:16,520
I don't know what your plan is, but
we'll protect the people of this town.

49
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,600
Leave this matter to us.

50
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,000
No!

51
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,500
These monsters are ours.

52
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,840
I won't give them to you!

53
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,610
Did you find anything?

54
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,940
Yeah, some skin with hair follicles...

55
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,280
...but I'm not sure if it's theirs.

56
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,660
I guess we have to take
the samples back to the lab.

57
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,780
Linda...

58
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,250
Please help me...

59
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,970
Save their souls with
great compassion...

60
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,210
Keep that in your mind, Linda.

61
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,350
Let's go get rid of these
nightmares, shall we?

62
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,680
I thought she was a woman at first.

63
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,050
But it was definitely
a wolf that attacked me.

64
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,030
Or perhaps it just looked like a wolf...

65
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,730
I don't get it.

66
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,300
What do you mean?

67
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,870
I don't know either.

68
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,130
I must've passed out.

69
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,610
I might not have made it if
it weren't for you guys.

70
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,440
What happened?

71
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,140
He was attacked.

72
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,210
Are you all right?

73
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,540
As you can see...

74
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,480
And who is that big one?

75
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,480
Oh, he is a friend of Kata's...

76
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,750
Kata?

77
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,160
She's your friend
who disappeared, right?

78
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,230
Yes. We stopped by here to see
if you had any information...

79
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,440
We've been terribly busy
since these freaks appeared...

80
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,070
Linda, Mary, Captain...

81
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,810
I'll gather the
monsters in Central Park.

82
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,380
What do you mean?

83
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,680
I'll see you later.

84
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,010
Hey, wait a minute...

85
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,750
Case, are you still working?

86
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,390
Yeah, I wanted to hand you the
samples I collected at the scene.

87
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,460
Thank you...

88
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,640
Have you examined them yet?

89
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,040
Yeah, it seems like the
virus created those monsters.

90
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,140
You can't just conclude that without
examining the sample carefully!

91
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,980
Because Kata is also...

92
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,810
I already met her!

93
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,360
Kata is the one who attacked me!

94
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,480
What are you doing?

95
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,630
I found out why they
are attacking people...

96
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,560
No, please stop this!

97
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,730
They're returning to their
primitive roots...

98
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,770
This might be a new
stage in human evolution...

99
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,280
Humans should be true to
their primitive desires...

100
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,580
Like animals!

101
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,580
No!

102
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,410
Mary, are you okay?

103
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,790
The water in the river
constantly changes.

104
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,970
The water constantly changes its
shape, never stays in the same place.

105
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,270
The water is just like people.

106
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,810
Captain!

107
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,510
The monsters are acting strange...

108
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,750
Seems like they're all
heading somewhere.

109
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,120
It's Central Park!

110
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,350
They're all heading for Central Park!

111
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,550
What's the matter?

112
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,220
There has been an accident...

113
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,580
Mary, you were haunted by
a bad dream, weren't you?

114
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,190
A bad dream?

115
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,200
You mean, Mary is going to be like
Kata?

116
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,230
No!

117
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,490
Mary, what's wrong?

118
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,630
Are you okay?

119
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,930
No, please stop it!

120
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,330
No, no, no...

121
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,040
Wake up from the nightmare, Mary.

122
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,010
Oh no, please stop...

123
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,550
Please no!

124
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,740
Please don't do this to me!

125
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,060
You are all right now!

126
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,970
I can finish the treatment with Kata.

127
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,200
Really?

128
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,740
Yes.

129
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,450
Is Kata coming here?

130
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,520
Yes.

131
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,380
I see...

132
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,930
Okay, we got him cornered.
Go over to the other side!

133
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,060
Catch him!

134
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,470
Hey, hold that side!

135
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,030
Be still!

136
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,300
Help!

137
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,080
Shoot her.

138
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,120
Put this talisman on
your gun, and shoot Kata.

139
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,800
Don't go there, come over here!

140
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,400
What are you doing? Capture him!

141
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,040
Damn!

142
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,740
Captain, we can't capture them, please
give us permission to kill them!

143
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,820
No, don't fire your guns!

144
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,350
What's this sound?

145
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,660
Charge!

146
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,310
Keep firing!

147
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,380
Kata, you don't remember me?

148
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,590
Kata, come down here!

149
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,720
I know somebody who can cure you.

150
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,960
She can't understand me anymore...

151
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,970
If you keep this talisman on
your gun, you can stop Kata.

152
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,440
Don't worry, in her current
state, she won't die from a bullet.

153
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,080
Kata...

154
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,400
Kata!

155
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,890
This is fun!

156
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,620
Let's go!

157
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,970
Colonel!

158
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,730
Stop right now!

159
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,970
Why?

160
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,840
Why would I want to stop?
This is such fun!

161
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,740
Colonel!

162
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,970
This isn't a game, stop this right away!

163
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,280
The fun has just started!

164
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,140
It's so heavy...

165
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,210
Oh, I'm sorry...

166
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,680
Where are we?

167
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,990
It looks like she came
to her senses too.

168
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,790
Kata!

169
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,860
Yeah, keep shooting!

170
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,000
Hey wait, you bastard!

171
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,900
Oh yes, shoot a missile or
two, make it big and loud.

172
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,110
Enough!

173
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,750
Just for you, I'll make it three!

174
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,870
Mary, come here and comfort Kata.

175
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,950
Don't worry, I'll hold her down so...

176
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,260
Number 5, number 7, number 10...

177
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,360
The time has come! Are you ready?

178
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,070
You are doing great...

179
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,680
It's your turn, Mary.

180
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,870
It's too big. I don't think it'll fit.

181
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,980
You are wet enough to take it in.

182
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,480
Who the hell was he talking to?

183
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,330
Number 5, number 7, number 10...

184
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,120
Fire!

185
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,920
Roger, firing number
5, number 7, number 10!

186
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,000
Hello?

187
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,130
Yes, it's me.

188
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,230
Excuse me, could I ask who is
speaking?

189
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,030
Who the hell are you?

190
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,700
We are the SWAT team.

191
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,640
We're trying to capture
the monsters in Central Park.

192
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,750
Central Park?

193
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,380
I'd get the hell out
of there if I were you.

194
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,110
What do you mean?

195
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,120
It's too big. I don't think it'll fit.

196
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,020
I don't think I can take this...

197
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,490
It's too tight!

198
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,960
No! Please don't lick down there!

199
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,810
My missiles are already on the
way. Take them as presents from me.

200
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,910
Don't cause any more trouble!

201
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,110
Order them to self-destruct!

202
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,620
Why?

203
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,620
Who would want to stop
this? It's so much fun!

204
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,890
What are you guys thinking?

205
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,870
Hey, the missiles are coming!

206
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,640
Get out of here!

207
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:25,540
It's too late!

208
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,010
We're saved...

209
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,290
We came...

210
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,470
So, is everything okay with you now?

211
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,040
Yeah, I feel like I was
having a strange dream...

212
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,340
What do you mean?

213
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,880
I felt like I was making
love with a chubby man...

214
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,780
Oh no, me too...

215
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,890
Captain!

216
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,820
Oh, you are all safe?

217
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,930
Are you all right, Captain?

218
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,060
I guess not...

219
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,500
This is nothing...

220
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,390
Did you see the news yesterday?

221
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,330
I did! Don't you think it's incredible?

222
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,910
So incredible!

223
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,200
I'll take pictures!

224
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,570
I thought we'd die...

225
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,770
Totally.

226
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,580
Hey, they're from the other day...

227
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,150
Excuse me, can we
take pictures with you?

228
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,780
Please, please, please!

229
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,150
Pictures, pictures pictures!

230
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,520
You're such a klutz, getting bit by a dog
the day before going back to Japan.

231
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,790
That dog was so cute!

232
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,460
You are dumb!

233
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,500
It really hurt!

234
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,570
Why don't you show some sympathy?

235
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,210
Stupid!
