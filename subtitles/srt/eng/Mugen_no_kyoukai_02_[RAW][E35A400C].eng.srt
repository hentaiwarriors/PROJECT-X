1
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,480
It should have beautiful flesh
and bone inside of the skin.

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,950
I am beautiful
and chase after the reality.

3
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,220
How can't I know?

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,300
Because of the pain to twist the face,
it looked more beautiful.

5
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,150
The breath of sorrow.

6
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,250
Also the frown
with the wrinkle between the lines.

7
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,620
And.

8
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,420
So sweet blood.

9
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,930
Only you.
Fruit in the garden.

10
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,630
Let me taste it.

11
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,330
Let me tast your sorrow.
Your sweet blood.

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,000
With the taste of fruit.

13
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,470
It is the form of our love.

14
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,340
Come on.

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,280
Let me see the proof.

16
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,350
Let me see the proof.

17
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,480
Come on.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,380
No.

19
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,430
Stop.

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,000
Awudalupu.

21
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,700
Sorry, I am late.

22
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,310
What you did is not love.

23
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,450
You ruin such a beautiful thing.
You are happy.

24
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,640
You are a pervert.

25
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,850
You want to brainwash you.

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,390
My body.

27
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,360
Disappear little by little.

28
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,630
Don't let you get away from it.

29
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,060
What?

30
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,930
Please remember this.

31
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,940
Next time,
I will scratch a cut on her body.

32
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,950
Disappear.

33
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,750
Being brainwashed?

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,280
No.

35
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,050
Before being brainwashed,
you killed yourself.

36
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,920
Only the soul ran away.

37
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,890
He must return to the nightmare world.

38
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,000
He will get the new body too.

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,590
Sorry, if I am here early.

40
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,930
No. I am happy if you want to save me.

41
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,410
Kalusia, this cut...

42
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,740
I am ok. No big deal.

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,850
This is the late apology.

44
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,250
I am here to tell you
about the true love.

45
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,550
Awudalupu.

46
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,560
Awudalupu...

47
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,500
Awudalupu.

48
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,470
No, I am not Awudalupu.

49
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,440
I am...

50
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,530
The Dream world 2.

51
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,530
Chenwu...

52
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,700
Chenwu.

53
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,070
Yes, I am Chenwu.

54
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,530
Chenwu.

55
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,370
So weird.

56
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,780
Good morning.

57
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,640
You are...

58
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,950
I am Weai.

59
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,660
Why are you here?

60
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,090
I am here to thank you
for saving me before.

61
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,550
Thank you.

62
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,930
Danger.

63
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,790
Thank you...

64
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,730
If you want to say thanks,
I got the gift.

65
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,900
So lucky.

66
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,740
What a great gift.

67
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,920
Chenwu.

68
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,560
No good. It swollen so big.

69
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,160
No good.
With such a strenght...

70
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,970
Chenwu.

71
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,500
Wait, Sonya, this is...

72
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,280
Say no more.

73
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,710
Sorry it is my fault.

74
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,310
No, this is not your fault, Weai.

75
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,510
No. It is Sonya.

76
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,380
Chenwu is no good.

77
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,720
Because you and Weai do some
dirty things, so they got your wrong.

78
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,130
Someone got you wrong idea
and hit people.

79
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,170
It is the girl? Sonya.

80
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,900
Yes, why are you
different from your sister?

81
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,010
What?

82
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,440
It is always Mai...

83
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,140
The sister of Mai
is not to pretend being cute?

84
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,550
What? What is that tone?

85
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,450
I am telling the truth.

86
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,250
What?

87
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,820
You two don't.

88
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,780
Leave me alone.

89
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,020
Shiro.

90
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,900
Sonya seemed to be strange.

91
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,740
Chenwu, you fool...

92
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,410
Shiro, where are you?

93
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,110
Shiro.

94
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,540
Shiro... hurry...

95
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,220
Shiro... where are you?

96
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,470
Shiro...

97
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,340
I got it.

98
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,680
Ok, don't move. Don't move.

99
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,920
Awudalupu.

100
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,200
Awudalupu...

101
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,000
Here again.

102
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,880
Awudalupu.

103
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,040
Awudalupu.

104
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,310
No, my name is...

105
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,740
You are finally here.

106
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,730
That voice is in my dream?
Is that yours?

107
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,520
My name is Acemilona.

108
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,790
I am the fairy to keep everything
in order in this world.

109
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,270
And then, you are...

110
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,470
I am Chenwu.

111
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,710
That is your current name?

112
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,180
But in the past.

113
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,910
You are one of the fairy, Awudalupu.

114
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,450
Awudalupu.

115
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,420
It had the war before.

116
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,400
That dream world has the fight
with the nightmare world.

117
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,030
Those creatures from
the nightmare world come across.

118
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,070
One of the powerful
is called Drangon Niskarma.

119
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,310
Everyone called him Ilong.

120
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,920
The battle of Ilong is very bad.

121
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,490
Fairies all died.

122
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,750
I am the last one.

123
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,520
So, we lost?

124
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,900
No, please seal Ilong.

125
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,670
But.

126
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,780
But what?

127
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,140
The power of the seal
is getting weaker.

128
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,580
Ilong wanted to come back.

129
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,720
He still wanted to destroy the world.

130
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,260
The place we lived...

131
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,260
Why?

132
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,470
Because Ilon found somethng...

133
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,870
He discovered the leader being you.

134
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,140
Many fairy will switch to your world.

135
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,580
We are the fairy.

136
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,810
But can deftet him.

137
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,010
Please think about it.

138
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,380
You are the fairy, Awudalupu.

139
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,250
You switch love and being love
to the power fo fighters

140
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,730
When you lose love,
you can be stronger.

141
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,000
That is right.
It is what the warrior loves.

142
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,640
I am love... warrior...

143
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,580
Please recall it.

144
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,110
Please recall it...

145
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,250
Please...

146
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,720
Please hand on...

147
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,790
Great, you awake.

148
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,760
Weai, Lian. Did you save me?

149
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,960
If you want to thank me,
say thanks to Shiro.

150
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,530
It is him to tell us
you are in the pool.

151
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,400
It is the fault of Shiro.

152
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,100
Forget it. It is the same.

153
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,070
Thank you, Shiro.

154
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,540
He is a naughty cat.

155
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,580
Weai, hard work.

156
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,810
Yes, no choice.

157
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,920
From the beginning, it disappeared.

158
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,150
What?

159
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:45,160
Since I discovered
I asked bystanders to help.

160
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,560
I remembered that man called Whom...

161
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,540
Yes, that man was called whom.

162
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,310
Did you say whom?

163
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,650
You, never won over me once.

164
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,910
I won 48 times.

165
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,020
48 straight.

166
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,150
You skip classes up here.

167
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,720
You...

168
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,500
I remember you are the new...

169
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,530
I am Yuko.

170
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,810
You seemed down, captain.

171
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,910
No.

172
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,810
No matter what, you can't win.

173
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,080
You are angry at yourself,
but no choice.

174
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,010
Really?

175
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,180
What are you talking about?

176
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,190
Teacher, I like to tease you.

177
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,690
Whom, you are great.

178
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:04,510
You are strong and powerful.

179
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,150
But you just forgot...

180
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,380
Your real power.

181
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,580
Let teacher help you out.

182
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,960
Teacher, what do you want?

183
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,110
There, it is there. Lick there.

184
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,390
That is right...

185
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,690
You have a good skill.

186
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,340
It seemed to be ready.

187
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,370
Let's enjoy the happiness
for not seeing such a long time.

188
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,110
What did you say?

189
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,530
Fucking good... good...

190
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,040
Fucking good... good...

191
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,510
Again, push it more.

192
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,010
Like this, push it more.

193
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,090
Yes, to solve your darkness.

194
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,660
This way, You can be more powerful.

195
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,090
To accpet the darkness.

196
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,360
When you give it to the dark power.

197
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,940
You can be stronger than anyone else.

198
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,270
You want to win, right.

199
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,600
You want to win over him right.

200
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,900
You want to win Awudalupu, right?

201
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,170
Hurry, come one...

202
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,510
Swear to the darkness.

203
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,850
The proof injected into my body.

204
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,950
Fairy...
You are falling.

205
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,680
The flower is beautiful.

206
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,220
Yes, those flower.

207
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,310
We need to care for it with our love.
They will return love too.

208
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,320
But, sorry.

209
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,950
If I can come early.

210
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,720
It won't last longer.

211
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:50,330
No, if you can help me out,
I am happy.

212
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,370
Weird.

213
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,310
I may have heard from somewhere.

214
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,910
About being late,
what happened to Sonya?

215
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,320
She will help
when Chenwu wanted to help.

216
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,920
Sonya...

217
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,400
Forget it, think about it.

218
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,900
Only I an Mai.

219
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,530
No matter what happened, no one knows.

220
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,050
What...

221
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,850
You...

222
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,720
Lawulubalu.

223
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,920
Whom, why you...

224
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,960
Whom, ahead of you.

225
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,540
Also a fairy before rebirth.

226
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,830
What did she say?

227
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,270
Ilong also found out.

228
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,700
It found out you are the leader.

229
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,540
Many fairies come to your world.

230
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,780
You are the nightmare.

231
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,790
Your memory got back.

232
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,560
If Whom is Lawulubalu,
why was he with nightmare?

233
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,620
It seemed to forget.

234
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,230
You seemed to forget Lawulubelu being
a nightmare after touching Ilong.

235
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,980
Lawulubalu became one of nightmare.

236
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,400
No, stop.

237
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,380
Open Mai.

238
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,350
In the mind of Lawulubalu,
he wanted to make love with a woman.

239
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,260
No.

240
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,730
Mai.

241
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,580
No...

242
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,090
You see. Check this out.

243
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,200
An orgasm.

244
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,820
Mai.

245
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,970
No...

246
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,540
No...

247
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,870
You want to run away?

248
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,610
Chenwu...

249
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,440
Mai.

250
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,710
Mai is the rebirth of Kalusia.

251
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,260
This is the apology for being late.

252
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,590
Let me tell you what the real love is.

253
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,520
Awudalupu.

254
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,900
Mai...

255
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,860
Did you remember the dream world?

256
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,700
I always have when I was young.

257
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,270
I thougt it was the dream.

258
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,440
Beside me,
I don't want anyone else to come here.

259
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,240
Mai.

260
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,220
Awudalupu.

261
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,620
Please love me, Kalusia.

262
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,680
Just like before.

263
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,050
Mai.

264
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,490
I am Chenwu.

265
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,620
I am the boy next door.

266
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,980
Mai, your pussy is so wet.

267
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,220
Chenwu.

268
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,120
Mai, your ass hole is beautiful.

269
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:50,090
Chenwu, your dick is very big.

270
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,030
Mai.

271
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,180
Fail?

272
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,750
Forget it. Lalulubalu is an experiment.

273
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,130
What?

274
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,280
From the forehead of Chenwu's dick,
it came with tasty honey.

275
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,720
Mai, you juice is also
tasty from your pussy.

276
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,560
Chenwu, get in.

277
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,930
Find your memory from my body.

278
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,230
Mai...

279
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,770
How can it be?

280
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,430
Mai.

281
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,510
Chenwu.

282
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,880
I am ready to fuck, Mai.

283
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,440
Fuck here.

284
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,590
Your pussy.

285
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,120
So wet, so warm, so good.

286
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,890
Me too.

287
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,360
Your dick.

288
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,970
Keep shaking in my body.

289
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,890
Mai, I am moving.

290
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,780
Chenwu.

291
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,050
Yes, like that. Hurry.

292
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,290
No.

293
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,390
I can't... ready to come.

294
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,260
I am coming.

295
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,680
Mai.

296
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,750
Chenwu.

297
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,000
I got a wonderful guy this time.

298
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,850
You are...

299
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,050
Your waist shakes so well.
Your pussy is wet.

300
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,660
Look. The expression is good.

301
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,900
Look. Madam.

302
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,870
Have a date with your husband alone?

303
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,250
Don't be this way.

304
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,180
You don't want
your husband to see this photo?

305
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,220
Madam.

306
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,620
I am almost there.

307
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,230
How can you be so reasonable
when you are a bitch in heat?

308
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,240
So horny.

309
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,370
It is definitely different from
the girls in the class.

310
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,650
Fool, of course it is different.

311
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,110
No voice, sister.

312
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,650
It is not good to hear the voice
of female in men's room.

313
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,190
So wet.

314
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,660
So wet.

315
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,270
Sister, you got excited so easy.

316
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,500
You can feel more in this place.

317
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,550
It is coming out, sister.
