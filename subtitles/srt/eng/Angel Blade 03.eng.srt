1
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:27,165
Act 3: Goddess Rising to Heaven

2
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:32,074
So, you're next.

3
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:36,775
No!

4
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:45,922
A beautiful moonlit night.

5
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,491
And who is it that
tarnishes that moon...

6
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:50,086
with a virgin's blood?

7
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:52,387
I'll lay that to rest.

8
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:58,030
The Moonlight Knight... Angel Blade.

9
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:13,013
Things are starting to heat up.

10
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:15,116
I'll keep tabs on everything.

11
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:18,486
Defeat Chloe and Elaine...

12
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,827
and prove to me that you'll become...

13
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:23,728
a worthy rival to Nailkaizer.

14
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:25,724
Angel Blade.

15
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:30,361
Can I win...

16
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:31,997
against these two?

17
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:34,273
Sister Seiru.

18
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,001
I'll protect you.

19
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:39,502
I'll protect everything that I love.

20
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:41,075
Mother.

21
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:42,378
Father.

22
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,051
Give Moena some strength!

23
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,981
Huh, that's perfect.

24
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:50,621
I came by to find bait to lure you...

25
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:52,314
but you saved me the effort.

26
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,654
I'll take you... now!

27
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:05,430
Damn.

28
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:08,570
I won't let you escape, Blade.

29
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,107
That's...

30
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:12,169
Angel Blade.

31
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:24,112
- Hey now, let's party.
- Come on, let's go.

32
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:26,589
- I don't know...
- Come on.

33
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,526
Wh... What is this?

34
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:46,809
No!

35
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:50,280
Die Blade!

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,452
Run!

37
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,124
How long can you run for?

38
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:05,259
Blade!

39
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:11,533
This is not good.

40
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:12,932
If I f'lght here right now...

41
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,701
innocent people will be hurt.

42
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:17,009
Here we go!

43
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:38,023
I guess you've
reached your limit...

44
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:39,693
Angel Blade.

45
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:46,903
If I let them continue...

46
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,907
I'm doomed.

47
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:50,742
What should I do?

48
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:51,944
What?

49
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,050
The nail in the coffin!

50
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:05,455
You'll be all right.

51
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,644
A-Are you...

52
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,383
a Blade too?

53
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:38,085
You little shit!

54
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:40,752
You pretending to
be a real angel, Blade?

55
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:48,057
I won't forgive you for this!

56
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:49,528
I won't!

57
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:52,234
Angel Blade!

58
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:56,941
I will have your head...

59
00:04:58,411 --> 00:04:59,605
next time...

60
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:01,013
I promise.

61
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:02,506
I promise!

62
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:04,113
I promise!

63
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,719
You look like
you're fine, Blade.

64
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:17,259
You are?

65
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:24,499
I'm Angel Ender.

66
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:26,906
I'm your...

67
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:28,935
prototype.

68
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:40,453
Why?

69
00:05:41,254 --> 00:05:43,222
Why can you fight like this?

70
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:48,217
What makes you this strong?

71
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:49,751
Blade.

72
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:07,369
Wow, unreal!

73
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:11,317
This was my only chance!

74
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:13,417
And I failed to see it!

75
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:14,681
What? What?

76
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:16,751
It was Blade, Blade!

77
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,856
I am so unlucky.

78
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,357
No luck for me.

79
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,953
I've only won the
lowest amount on the lottery too.

80
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:25,495
And I've got no boobs.

81
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:27,532
But what's that
got to do with it?

82
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:28,929
Huh?

83
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,127
What's this?

84
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,734
Hey, old man.

85
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,507
You sleep there, you'll catch a cold.

86
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,033
Are you caught up in this mess?

87
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:39,810
Are you hungry?

88
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,069
Hello?

89
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,372
He... llo!

90
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:51,556
To Seiru Tenmyoin?

91
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:52,819
Yes.

92
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,021
So that means
Tenmyoin is Angel Blade.

93
00:06:58,198 --> 00:06:59,324
No, that's not right.

94
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:00,059
Huh?

95
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:04,431
I myself have determined
that she is not Angel Blade.

96
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:06,399
But you still want
to capture her?

97
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:08,271
She's the bait...

98
00:07:08,308 --> 00:07:09,969
to entice Blade.

99
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:11,539
Bait?

100
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,043
She's the only one
in this school...

101
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,106
who's had contact with her.
Twice.

102
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,212
I see.

103
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:23,789
So maybe there's some
kind of connection with Blade.

104
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:25,718
You look happy.

105
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:29,392
You want a taste of her...

106
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:30,990
that bad?

107
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:32,029
N-No.

108
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:33,831
That's not it.

109
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:35,701
Well, whatever.

110
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:39,166
I'll entice Blade out tonight.

111
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,536
Just make sure you get the bait.

112
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:43,869
I'll handle it.

113
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,772
W... Wait!

114
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:51,044
Please, wait.

115
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:52,951
Ms. Nailkaizer!

116
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,082
What?

117
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,689
In order to ensure
our plan is successful...

118
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:04,854
there is something I
need to ask you, Nailkaizer.

119
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:07,028
Say it.

120
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:08,562
Yes.

121
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:11,669
I want you to give
me some more power.

122
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:14,802
So I want your...

123
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,508
You want a piece of me?

124
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:23,138
Y-Yes, please.

125
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:28,252
Fine. I'll give you
some of my strength.

126
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:31,123
Thank you!

127
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,173
Stunning!

128
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:50,941
What's wrong?

129
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:52,906
You want some, right?

130
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:56,680
You want some of
Nailkaizer's golden juices.

131
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:59,208
Y... Yes.

132
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,465
Student body president
Seiru Tenmyoin.

133
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:51,093
The headmaster wishes to see you.

134
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,070
Please report to the
headmaster's off'lce.

135
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:56,768
I'll repeat.

136
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,268
Seiru Tenmyoin.

137
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:00,937
The headmaster wishes to see you.

138
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,811
Please report to the
headmaster's off'lce.

139
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:31,042
Fantastic.

140
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:37,514
I had no idea you
had such a hot body.

141
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:45,015
Watching you through a monitor
doesn't compare to this.

142
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:14,786
Oh, the softness.

143
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,411
And such bounce!

144
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:18,023
Fantastic.

145
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:25,931
Headmaster.

146
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,466
You're awake now Miss Tenmyoin?

147
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:33,269
Why...

148
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:35,265
my headmaster?

149
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:38,541
What are you...

150
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:40,469
Ugh! No!

151
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:41,814
No, stop!

152
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:43,076
Please stop, headmaster!

153
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,178
Why?

154
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:47,920
Why do this?

155
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:51,480
You're getting stimulated,
Miss Tenmyoin.

156
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,290
Your nipples are getting hard.

157
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:55,523
No.

158
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,058
No... No way.

159
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:02,189
I don't approve of the
student body president lying.

160
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:06,904
You're rock hard.

161
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:08,831
Aren't you now?

162
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,177
No.

163
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:39,033
You're dripping wet.

164
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:42,700
I can see your shape
now that it's transparent.

165
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:47,002
Um, there...

166
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,082
No.

167
00:12:53,286 --> 00:12:54,253
No, don't.

168
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:27,480
I can't believe you're
gushing this much.

169
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,387
More than I expected,
Miss Tenmyoin.

170
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:32,218
No.

171
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:36,188
You don't like it?

172
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:41,328
But this is screaming for more.

173
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:52,043
No!

174
00:13:58,518 --> 00:13:59,951
Brilliant.

175
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,855
This is Seiru Tenmyoin's
soft savannah.

176
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,559
The pearl that glistens
ever so brightly.

177
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:12,391
The beautiful wave that
glistens honey.

178
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:14,189
Absolutely fantastic.

179
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:17,367
Let me get a taste.

180
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:19,093
N... No.

181
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:34,751
N... No.

182
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,621
No... more.

183
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,756
Closed Temporarily. So Sorry.

184
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,423
Angel Ender.

185
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:21,664
What is going on
in this world?

186
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,236
What can I do?

187
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:36,537
So then...

188
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:42,418
time for the main dish.

189
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:46,718
How do you...

190
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:49,585
...like this?

191
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,663
Get ready to have this
shoved in you.

192
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,324
N-No!

193
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:56,868
No, don't!

194
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,025
Not that!

195
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:06,673
No!

196
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,312
Forgive me.

197
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:10,046
Forgive me!

198
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,383
Please, forgive me!

199
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:15,415
Here it goes!

200
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:30,099
God damn!

201
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,231
Nice!

202
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:34,234
Seiru!

203
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:37,571
Hurts.

204
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:39,271
It hurts!

205
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:09,700
My body.

206
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:13,036
Getting hot are we?

207
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,142
Why?

208
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:19,543
Why am I getting so hot?

209
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,508
And turned on?

210
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,954
Yeah, Seiru.

211
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:31,263
You're...

212
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:34,633
fantastic!

213
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:53,383
Sister!

214
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:56,152
Angel Heart...

215
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:57,485
Flash!

216
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,600
Motor Blade!

217
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:51,404
Sis...

218
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:53,942
Seiru.

219
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:02,719
Seiru.

220
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:05,086
Seiru.

221
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,719
Are you okay?

222
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:26,306
Sister... Seiru.

223
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,487
Sister.

224
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:37,544
What in the...

225
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:50,632
Sister... Seiru.

226
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,034
Sister.

227
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:07,541
Why does it feel...

228
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:09,380
so good?

229
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:12,749
This is a lot better
than when I do it alone.

230
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:31,101
I...

231
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:32,139
I'm coming.

232
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:49,556
S-Sister... Seiru.

233
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:53,057
I...

234
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:54,395
was with you, sister.

235
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:08,635
What?

236
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:16,077
A lesbian show by
the fighter for justice.

237
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:19,181
I've quite enjoyed it, Angel Blade.

238
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:25,592
This is thanks for letting
me watch something interesting.

239
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:40,943
Why?

240
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:45,147
Why don't I...

241
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:47,542
have any strength?

242
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,250
You feeling it yet, Blade?

243
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:54,886
Feeling it? Not me.

244
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:57,593
No.

245
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:03,357
I didn't think you'd
fall into my trap this easily.

246
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:05,867
Looks like you used up
all your strength...

247
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:09,271
to undo the spell I
cast on Seiru.

248
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:11,932
The strength you have now...

249
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:14,502
is the same as a commoner.

250
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:21,786
No.

251
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,844
My anus.

252
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:24,617
Don't do that so much.

253
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:40,662
You're called Angel Blade, but
in the end you are just a female.

254
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:43,432
The floor is drenched.

255
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:46,936
You're so wet.

256
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:51,507
I shudder to think you're
called the Moonlight Knight.

257
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:55,018
So then, let's have a look...

258
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:56,988
at all of you.

259
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,457
What?

260
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:01,554
No.

261
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,192
Don't spread me open.

262
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:10,092
Not like this. No!

263
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:12,967
Fantastic!

264
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:16,597
The color, shape, sensation, and smell.

265
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:21,372
I can't believe such
an incredible thing exists.

266
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:23,478
No...

267
00:23:23,882 --> 00:23:25,747
Don't look so much.

268
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:27,274
I'm embarrassed.

269
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:30,621
Why now?

270
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:33,489
You've been parading around
in this outfit for a long time.

271
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:36,051
You can show this off...

272
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:39,531
but you can't stand someone
forcing themselves on you.

273
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:41,057
No.

274
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,300
I'm not okay with this.

275
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:44,694
I...

276
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:50,472
Thoroughly enjoy...

277
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:53,603
the skills of my tongue.

278
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:07,616
No.

279
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:09,585
Don't.

280
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:19,367
Angel...

281
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:20,501
Blade.

282
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:36,719
So then, time for
the glorious main dish.

283
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:39,691
What is...

284
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:40,419
this?

285
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:43,156
This is a man's...

286
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:45,088
It's huge.

287
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,529
It's pulsating.

288
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:49,400
This f'lts into me?

289
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:51,225
But...

290
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,965
it's no use.

291
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:53,796
I...

292
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:55,570
Father...

293
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:56,369
Mother...

294
00:24:56,508 --> 00:24:57,600
Forgive me.

295
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:01,943
Here we go, Blade!

296
00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:10,722
Let go of Angel Blade!

297
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:11,848
You monster!

298
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,094
Haven't gotten enough
of me, Miss Tenmyoin?

299
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:20,091
But you see, I'm just
about to have my main dish.

300
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:22,596
Be quiet and watch from there.

301
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:32,776
Sister... Seiru.

302
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:39,943
W-What?

303
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:47,650
Angel Blade...

304
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:49,017
take this!

305
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:55,490
What is...

306
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:58,295
this power? This speed?

307
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:03,132
Is this the true strength
of Angel Blade?

308
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:06,472
Beautiful.

309
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:08,176
She looks like...

310
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:12,041
...a real Angel.

311
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:34,166
How? How can this
happen to me?

312
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:37,202
Ultimate Dynamic!

313
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:57,754
N-Nailkaizer.

314
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:04,194
Please give me some strength.

315
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,497
You can't even save yourself...

316
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,200
and you lay hands
on your master's prey.

317
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:12,033
You're worth less than a dog.

318
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:30,989
The strength that comes
from the need to protect.

319
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:34,321
Do I...

320
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:35,596
have that?

321
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:39,697
The need to protect something.

322
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:59,681
The shadowy hands pierce
dreams with echoing screams.

323
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:06,357
And against it is beautiful light
that casts away the darkness.

324
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:13,362
The hidden skin is the mark of an angel.

325
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:22,472
As solitary tears take over the town.

326
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:37,460
I sing an uplifting melody as
beauty protects all that I am.

327
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:44,164
Evil lives and forbidden love.

328
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:50,633
But the form of the warrior
who cuts the darkness still shimmers.

329
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:55,437
You light the vision.

330
00:29:34,386 --> 00:29:36,081
This woman...

331
00:29:36,855 --> 00:29:39,517
is the test for Angel System.

332
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:43,292
Good job, Karin.

333
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:49,900
Miss Maina.

334
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:52,494
Hurry, my Angel.

335
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:56,531
The legendary day of celebration is near.
