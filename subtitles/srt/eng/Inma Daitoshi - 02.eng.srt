1
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:03,961
Beast City...

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:09,291
No one knows when they
started to call it that.

3
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:13,371
The Beast Clan had
settled into this city.

4
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,911
They tempted people with pleasure
to transform them into beasts.

5
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,811
As the Beast Clan numbers grow,
so do the city's citizens' fears.

6
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,921
But someone who has defied the
Beast Clan has come to this city...

7
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,161
Vampire Madonna.

8
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:44,031
Vampire Madonna is a huge threat
to the Beast Clan's existence.

9
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:04,591
Vampire Madonna also has a voracious
appetite for sex with humans...

10
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,561
because her clan has
their own needs as well.

11
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:19,131
Karma, who headed the Beast Clan,
fought against Vampire Madonna.

12
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:23,971
The war between these two clans,
of which humans are no match for...

13
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:28,631
ended because of Vampire
Madonna's overwhelming power.

14
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:36,081
The war concluded with Karma
being destroyed by the Vampires.

15
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:41,881
I felt the power from his death,
and I knew which path to take.

16
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,131
Yes, it's coming.

17
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:29,601
The new world order is
beginning & I'm ready.

18
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:43,971
Why...Why has it come?

19
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,111
The Beast that destroyed our home is
here!

20
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:49,291
Why is it here?

21
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,991
Worthless beast!

22
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:05,161
Where are our comrades?

23
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:09,141
They were chasing down beasts, and
haven't come back from section 7 yet.

24
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:11,531
Guess they're doing what
they always do, right?

25
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:16,371
No, please let me go.

26
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:28,251
Let me get some of this sweet stuff!

27
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,751
How does that feel, huh?

28
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:38,501
Please stop it, please.

29
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,431
Hey there, lady, I'll play with you.

30
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,471
You won't be lonely anymore.

31
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:46,301
Now let's get a look at everything.

32
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,011
No!

33
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:57,751
We're gonna protect
you from the beasts...

34
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:03,491
That's why we're keeping you here.

35
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:09,491
Yes. There are a lot of
beasts roaming the city.

36
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:14,201
The people of this area
cannot live without us...

37
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:16,861
And our protection.

38
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:21,531
So then...I guess you would have to say...

39
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:25,011
We're better than having the beasts
around, wouldn't you say so, huh, baby?

40
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,661
Get off.

41
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:47,661
Wait, dude...

42
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:50,101
I'm gonna come soon...

43
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:56,501
ldiot! What makes you think I
have to wait for you?!

44
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:15,551
Who are these females?

45
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:18,771
Who are you?

46
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:23,461
Hey, hey! We're here to
make you feel good, right?!

47
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,731
Stick around creeps,
the party is just about to begin.

48
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,371
Huh? What? The party? What's that?

49
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,701
Yes. Our little sex party.

50
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:34,241
And your very excited endorphins...

51
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:36,551
Endorphins?

52
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:37,711
Are you..?

53
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:44,181
Beasts?
You're beasts?

54
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:46,721
It was you who wanted us.

55
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:48,091
You can't reject us.

56
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:53,691
Now, you give me your...your...

57
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:04,801
I don't know about you but I'm
not interested, Anne.

58
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:08,541
It's okay for the
beasts to keep doing it...

59
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:12,451
But self-control keeps us
from getting some ourselves.

60
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:15,711
We've got few options
left because of this.

61
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:18,351
Let's go get some guy's
blood to keep us busy.

62
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,691
I'm falling.

63
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:34,871
Aine!

64
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,271
Shit! What's happening?

65
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:41,111
Why? Here I go again.

66
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,651
You crazy thing. Are you okay, Aine?

67
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,281
It hurts a lot.

68
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:53,591
What's happened?

69
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:55,221
Beasts? Come back!

70
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:58,261
Bat...Some kind of bat.

71
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:00,401
Flying...all around.

72
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,591
Hit against some kind of wall...

73
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:04,531
And fell down.

74
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:07,341
Oh, I see...

75
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,541
Damn it! Well it looks
like we've got trouble.

76
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:18,081
We can't get out of this city.

77
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:23,091
This barrier was put
up by the beasts.

78
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:27,281
Us, the humans and the beasts
can't get out of this city.

79
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:30,421
What are they up to?

80
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:35,261
What is going on in this city?
We must find out quickly.

81
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:50,571
A transfer student?
What's that?

82
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:53,481
You don't know anything, college girl.

83
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:54,551
A transfer student is someone who
comes from one college to another.

84
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:55,221
Tatsuo.
A transfer student is someone who
comes from one college to another.

85
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,891
A transfer student is someone who
comes from one college to another.

86
00:09:56,891 --> 00:10:01,191
Hey, Tatsuo!
A transfer student is someone who
comes from one college to another.

87
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:03,191
TAT-SU-O!!!

88
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,861
Aine, what are you doing?

89
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:08,771
Aine, what are you doing?
Megumi, do you know
you've got a few cavities?

90
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:10,371
Tatsuo is peeping into your skirt.
Megumi, do you know
you've got a few cavities?

91
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:11,511
Tatsuo is peeping into your skirt.
Two in the back,
and one in the front.

92
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:12,771
Two in the back,
and one in the front.

93
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:15,501
- Do you get enough calcium?
- You know, he's a pervert!

94
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,771
Everyone take your seats!
Quickly now...

95
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:22,081
Allow me to introduce a transfer
who'll be joining us.

96
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:27,681
Her university closed down,
so she transferred to this one.

97
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:29,621
Her name is Seia Kannazuki.

98
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,381
She is an excellent student.

99
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:35,621
Study hard, everyone.

100
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:38,861
I'm Kannazuki...Hello everyone.

101
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,871
- It is nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too

102
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:44,871
I'm Tatsuo.
My pleasure.

103
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:45,631
Here!

104
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:48,141
Take a seat here, next to me, please.

105
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,401
Damn you, Tatsuo!

106
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,511
What are you talking about?!

107
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,051
Nobody wants to sit next to you!
Who do you think you are?

108
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:54,771
Shut up!

109
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:57,011
- You've already got a woman, me!
- Miss Kannazuki.

110
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:57,741
Yes?

111
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,821
You'd be better off not associating
with these kind of people.

112
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:05,221
You know, I'd really like to but
I don't mind...

113
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:08,261
No way. Especially him,
being such a bad influence.

114
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,651
There's a seat next to Kubota.

115
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:11,891
Why don't you take
your place over there.

116
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:14,161
Let's begin our studies.

117
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:15,791
Everyone, be quiet.

118
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:25,871
Megumi, 'cause of you
I couldn't talk with Seia...

119
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:26,711
What's the matter?!

120
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,751
What's your problem, huh, Tatsuo?
Seia is just Seia!

121
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:32,881
I'm Megumi, you idiot.
I'm the only woman you'll ever need!

122
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,021
I have to interrupt your
little love quarrel.

123
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,281
Excuse me, can you spare
some time to talk?

124
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,331
Mina has something to say.

125
00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:47,071
Hey there, you're that fox I met before.

126
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:48,401
Stop that!

127
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:49,461
Megumi.

128
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:51,841
I'm interested in talking with you.

129
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:53,241
Huh?

130
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:54,941
Me?

131
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:56,771
Why? What's up?

132
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:00,541
Stop...

133
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:05,411
Which group are you with?

134
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:24,661
Feels good, doesn't it Professor?

135
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:27,371
Miss Kannazuki, you're...

136
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:32,541
Professor, I wanted to sit next
to that cute guy Tatsuo.

137
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,341
But you kept him from me.

138
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:37,311
No, I didn't know, I didn't mean to.

139
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:41,681
I do not believe you.
I will not forgive you for that.

140
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,191
I'm going to give you punishment now,
Professor.

141
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:50,591
Don't do that to your professor.

142
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:53,431
I'm your professor,
why are you doing this to me..? Don't!

143
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:03,131
Take this and this and this!

144
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:11,821
Say that you're sorry!
Say you're sorry!

145
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:14,011
Everything's ready, Seia.

146
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,291
Stop this!

147
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,961
What more do you want from me?

148
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:29,371
I want you to apologize to Seia.

149
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,201
I want you to swear your undying
sexual loyalty only to me.

150
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,291
Why? Seia.

151
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,341
Apologize, apologize to me.

152
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:45,041
Apologize to Seia.

153
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:53,291
I am sorry.

154
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:55,821
Please stop this, Miss Seia.

155
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,621
I promise I'll do whatever you want.

156
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:00,991
Is that right?

157
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:05,391
Will you swear your undying
loyalty to me forever?

158
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:10,911
I want you to be my slave and do
my bidding forever and ever.

159
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:17,481
What..What are you doing?

160
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:20,581
No!

161
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:25,321
You lucky slave!
You're going to be a slave...

162
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:26,951
...and belong to Seia just like us.

163
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:35,901
How very nasty.

164
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:39,171
Professor, you sure know
how to make these roses grow.

165
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,041
Now, it's time to wrap this up
and get everything prepared.

166
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:45,001
Yes, Master Seia.

167
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,411
No, stop!

168
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:48,941
Leave me alone!

169
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:53,311
Feel...Feel more.

170
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:56,181
Give me all of your feelings.

171
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:59,821
Yes, you're going
to be a good pet.

172
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:22,811
I didn't know that this
city had such a place.

173
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:26,151
I've been thinking that this
building was kind of strange.

174
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,281
But, I guess I never thought that...

175
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,311
You've been here
before, right?

176
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:32,361
Oh, have I?

177
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:33,221
Yes.

178
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:36,331
Aine and Anne caused
you to lose some of your memory...

179
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:37,491
But you can still remember.

180
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:43,731
No, your blood has the
remnant of you being a beast!

181
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:46,311
What are we doing here?

182
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:54,551
Tatsuo and I are going
to make love here.

183
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:56,811
We're going to make love forever.

184
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,211
I love you, Tatsuo...

185
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:01,751
I love you.

186
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,931
What..What are you talking about?

187
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:10,591
Do you think I used to be a beast?

188
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:13,361
That I was killed
because I attacked Tatsuo?

189
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:14,401
Are you kidding me?

190
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,301
What?! What are you?

191
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:22,871
I am Mina.

192
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:25,571
My home was destroyed by the Beast.

193
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:32,051
I was born only to destroy the beasts
and all their ugly hosts. I'm a vampire.

194
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,391
Monster!

195
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,511
You're a monster
just like the beasts!

196
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:41,461
You may think I'm a monster.

197
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:43,821
But I'm not a beast.

198
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,861
I don't carry the
evil the beasts do.

199
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:50,531
They exist to fulfill their desires
and kill to feed their lusts.

200
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:54,271
I..I can't believe it...

201
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:02,111
What..?
Beasts..?

202
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,941
Vampires..?

203
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:05,281
I have nothing to do with...

204
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:12,551
- No! Let me go!
- Why?!

205
00:17:12,661 --> 00:17:16,491
I can smell the beast in you!
Your very nature gives off this scent.

206
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:20,291
Tell me, did Karma call for you or...

207
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:22,131
Did you call for Karma?

208
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:27,901
Tell me, do you crave the
desires the beasts have?

209
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,941
Why have the beasts come here?

210
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:34,981
Tell me! What are
the beasts up to?

211
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,351
No! Stop it!

212
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:47,391
Who are you..?

213
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:49,291
A beast?
A human being?

214
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,231
Or...

215
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:54,561
What?

216
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:59,461
What is this power?
Tell me, how did you do that?

217
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:01,301
Please, don't ask me.

218
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:05,001
Keep away from me.

219
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:08,371
I don't want to fight you.

220
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:12,211
I was born only to fight against
the power which will destroy this world.

221
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:13,651
I only...

222
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:16,191
I only want to love Tatsuo...

223
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:18,221
To be with Tatsuo...

224
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:22,291
Stop. I didn't want to hear that.
That wasn't what I asked you...

225
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,561
I...love...him...

226
00:18:27,131 --> 00:18:28,661
Oh, how unfortunate for you.

227
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,071
Your destiny has
splintered into two.

228
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:38,671
One is for the one you love,
while the other is...

229
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:39,541
No...

230
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:41,411
It can't happen...

231
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,011
It can't be...

232
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:48,951
So...

233
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:53,791
You couldn't meet with the male?

234
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:56,191
I'm sorry, Father.

235
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,531
There weren't any chances
for us while at the university.

236
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:00,471
Father, please don't worry about it!

237
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:02,831
The Professor has been
now brought to our side.

238
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:03,731
In a few days...

239
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:04,971
Silence!

240
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:15,241
In a few days?

241
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:18,281
How dare you suggest that?!

242
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:23,921
Do you understand why
you are still able to exist?

243
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:31,761
You can't live without me.

244
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:38,001
Forgive me, Father, please.

245
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,801
Please forgive us, Father.

246
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:46,311
That's enough, Father.
You may leave them alone.

247
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,881
They've done well.

248
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,511
Both of them have done well
as my slaves...

249
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:51,671
And they have pleased me as my pets...

250
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:53,651
But...Seia

251
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,881
I really hate having
such a nasty father, you know.

252
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:00,691
All right, as you wish, Seia.

253
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:05,761
However, you've failed to keep
your promise to me Seia, right?

254
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:10,031
Oh, Father, I know I will do
as I promised you faithfully.

255
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:13,101
I'm sorry.

256
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:15,501
The university is very interesting.

257
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:18,371
Why didn't you have
me attend sooner?

258
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:21,781
If something were
to happen to Seia...

259
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,621
You worry too much about me, Father.

260
00:20:25,551 --> 00:20:26,711
But, Tatsuo...

261
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:30,291
That really sexy guy you recommended?

262
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:35,821
I don't believe he is worth
receiving Seia's love.

263
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:37,531
Oh, but...

264
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:39,391
I'll just do it for you, Father.

265
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:42,531
Thank you, Seia.

266
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:45,971
I love you much more
than anyone else.

267
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:52,941
I created the Kannazuki Group,
and I created these beasts.

268
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:56,541
Everything I do, I do
because I love you.

269
00:20:57,121 --> 00:21:01,251
All of this comes
from my love for you.

270
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:07,861
Seia, I can do everything
and anything for you.

271
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:11,701
Prepare for injection!

272
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:26,381
Father, give it to me...
please give it to me...

273
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:27,641
What's that?

274
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:31,811
Please..Please give it to me...

275
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:33,811
Bitch!

276
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:38,051
You just can't figure it out...

277
00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:39,681
What am I going to do?

278
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:48,691
What should I do with this city,
with this world, and what's to come?

279
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:07,251
Who are you?

280
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:11,351
The procedure here is that you should
talk to the Assistant Dean first.

281
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:16,461
Get out!

282
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:18,631
This is my seat.

283
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,031
Sit in your own seat!

284
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,171
I don't care if you're new here.

285
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:25,101
Shut up!

286
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:27,261
Don't worry, miss, you can sit
wherever you want.

287
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:30,601
Hey, you, how about sitting in
Megumi's seat?

288
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:32,141
Oh, miss...Right, Seia?

289
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,941
What's that?! That's bullshit.

290
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:35,311
- I'm so happy.
- You can't just do that to me.

291
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,941
Seia's sitting next to me and
that fucking Megumi is absent...

292
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:39,751
It's my favorite seat.

293
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:42,581
Now you think you can just move me
around like a cow...why I'll.

294
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:44,451
And...And..!

295
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:48,191
Will you shut your foolish mouth!

296
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:50,661
Why do you insist on
interrupting my group?

297
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:51,591
Professor...

298
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:54,461
Miss Seia wants to sit in this seat.

299
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:56,801
Be quiet and just let her have it!

300
00:22:57,601 --> 00:22:59,201
What's the matter with the Professor?

301
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:00,571
How did she get so strong?

302
00:23:01,411 --> 00:23:02,741
How scary...

303
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,111
Anyway, now you can sit
next to me in peace and quiet.

304
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,011
Please be good to me,
I'm such a gentle soul

305
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:11,241
I feel the same way.
Please be good to me, Tatsuo.

306
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,981
Excuse me.

307
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:17,011
I've just transferred into this
college today, and my name is Mina.

308
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:18,451
Please be good to me!

309
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,121
Mina! How did we get so lucky?

310
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:24,061
What? A new transfer?

311
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:26,651
Why the hell didn't I hear
anything about you...

312
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:28,961
Sorry if he didn't tell you about this,

313
00:23:29,071 --> 00:23:32,131
"Permit" .
but I got permission
from the Dean himself.

314
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:35,331
So, now that we got that out of the way,

315
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:38,881
is there an extra seat
for me to sit in, Professor?

316
00:23:45,851 --> 00:23:48,151
Mina, you're so forward...

317
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,811
You don't like women like me?

318
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:53,361
Of course I like them.

319
00:23:55,191 --> 00:24:00,101
Promise me you'll keep away from
all other women except for me.

320
00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:06,931
Don't you know that I've been so excited
to get you ever since I've met you?

321
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:09,101
You have?

322
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:11,401
Me too...

323
00:24:12,611 --> 00:24:13,241
Really?

324
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:14,501
Check!

325
00:24:14,981 --> 00:24:16,241
Bingo!

326
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:18,341
Tatsuo, get it up!

327
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:19,851
- Get it up!
- No! Not here!

328
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:22,151
But, ejaculating here at college...

329
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:22,911
Oh, Professor!

330
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:25,821
What are you doing here?

331
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,391
Try to act properly
with the other people.

332
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:29,691
What's going on with you two?

333
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:32,021
No, nothing's going on.

334
00:24:32,131 --> 00:24:33,601
Everything we're doing
here is innocent...

335
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:36,261
Nothing out of the ordinary,
just a little...

336
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:37,431
Bingo!

337
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,701
I'll play Bingo too!

338
00:24:41,611 --> 00:24:42,371
Here?

339
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:46,141
I'll let you touch my...

340
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,231
All right!

341
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:48,401
I won't forgive this.

342
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,211
Ah, yes! Yes!

343
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:53,011
Feels so good...

344
00:24:53,151 --> 00:24:54,381
Kill them.

345
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:56,081
Bingo!

346
00:24:56,191 --> 00:24:57,711
Finger Click!

347
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:02,821
So, you're a beast!

348
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,451
I knew you would show yourself if
I started getting close to Tatsuo.

349
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:07,831
Get out of here, Tatsuo!

350
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:10,471
I'm going!

351
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:14,231
I will never forgive anyone...

352
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:16,271
Who keeps me from my prey!

353
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,681
He is none of your business! Take this.

354
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:20,811
Beast!

355
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:22,541
Beast, beast, beast!

356
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:24,351
Oh, my God!

357
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,821
Our professor turned into a beast
when Mina and I were fooling around.

358
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:29,291
I can't believe what I just saw there.
You're not going to believe it either.

359
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:32,251
This place is really dangerous,
isn't it?

360
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:37,221
Tatsuo, I have another idea. Why don't
you come to a safe place with us?

361
00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:43,301
Who am I?

362
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:45,891
Am I possessed by the beast?

363
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:49,811
Am I no longer an ordinary
human being now?

364
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:53,141
I like Tatsuo, I really love him...

365
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:55,611
But did I attack and
try to kill Tatsuo..?

366
00:25:58,051 --> 00:25:59,111
No.

367
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,341
I don't want to change.

368
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:02,381
No, I don't want to.

369
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:05,691
Not now...

370
00:26:08,261 --> 00:26:09,631
Beast!

371
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:11,961
The professor of
Room 3 is a beast!

372
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,701
This power you possess doesn't
come from the Beast world.

373
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:25,441
You're getting in
the way of all our plans.

374
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:26,811
Who are you?

375
00:26:27,511 --> 00:26:28,171
I'm Mina.

376
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:31,811
Our home was destroyed when you
attempted to resurrect the Beast.

377
00:26:31,921 --> 00:26:33,151
I'm a vampire!

378
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:35,811
I shall destroy you, beast...

379
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:38,781
You chicken!
I'm not done talking yet!

380
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,091
Shut up!

381
00:26:41,191 --> 00:26:44,291
I have never heard Seia mention
anything about vampires before.

382
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:47,061
But if you want to fight...

383
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:49,131
I will show you no mercy.

384
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:49,891
Aine!

385
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:52,101
Oh, please show mercy...

386
00:27:05,821 --> 00:27:06,581
What's that?

387
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:11,051
Will you quit it with that thing!

388
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:16,591
I'll kill this woman if
you get in our way again.

389
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:19,901
Oh, Aine.

390
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:24,131
I will never let you escape.

391
00:27:25,071 --> 00:27:26,471
Seia's room?

392
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,471
Right?

393
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:30,611
Yes, Tatsuo,
it certainly is safe here...

394
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:32,471
And now we can do something
that'll make us all feel good.

395
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:35,841
Wait...

396
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:39,711
You've got such a nice piece.

397
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:42,781
Why do you want to sleep with me?

398
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:45,781
Just play and have fun with Seia.

399
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:51,531
I'll make you feel real good.

400
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:56,001
You are so cute.

401
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:58,631
You can touch me here.

402
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:17,721
Feels so good, Tatsuo.

403
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:19,421
More, for Seia.

404
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:20,721
S..Seia.

405
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:31,191
I'm feeling good too.

406
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:26,891
You're mine forever.
You're feeling good, right, Tatsuo?

407
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:33,561
Wonderful, so wonderful, Seia.

408
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:36,191
You really are good, daughter.

409
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:40,361
My dream will finally come true.
I will attain that awesome power.

410
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,511
What's happened?!

411
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,241
Miss Seia!

412
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:50,921
That woman who calls herself a
vampire is trying to ruin your...

413
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:52,851
Miss Seia...

414
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:55,551
What's that?

415
00:29:56,621 --> 00:30:02,491
Kannazuki has been amassing a
huge amount of power these days.

416
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:05,161
Why do the beasts
head towards there?

417
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,261
Miss Seia!

418
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:10,461
Something terrible's happened!

419
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:13,901
That woman who calls herself a
vampire is trying to ruin your...

420
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:17,241
How rude! Barging in
here without knocking!

421
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:20,471
A woman interfering with my plans?

422
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:25,311
I will never forgive anyone who
interferes with Father's plans.

423
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:27,641
Let's go, Nozomi, Hikaru.

424
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:32,191
lntruder in the tower!
lntruder in the tower!

425
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:36,691
Attention, all guards!
Execute them on sight!

426
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:37,821
Repeat!

427
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:40,621
Got them!

428
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:45,041
You cover here.

429
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:47,671
Stay in front of Seia's room.
Nobody leaves.

430
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:52,171
I want a shot at some action.

431
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:53,541
Who's there?

432
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:00,181
Tatsuo...

433
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:03,721
Tatsuo...

434
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:05,791
Me..Megumi.

435
00:31:06,661 --> 00:31:08,061
Tatsuo.

436
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:09,491
You poor thing.

437
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:14,501
It just began right before I got here.

438
00:31:15,201 --> 00:31:17,531
What's going to happen to me?

439
00:31:17,671 --> 00:31:20,071
H...Help..Help me, Megumi.

440
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:21,431
I'll stop it.

441
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,771
I'll help, Tatsuo.

442
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:28,001
Only I can stop it, Tatsuo.

443
00:31:28,111 --> 00:31:29,241
Megumi.

444
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:41,661
Where have they gone?

445
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:42,891
Damn. Look for them.

446
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:46,661
Shit!

447
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:49,791
Searching for Aine in this
place, it's too difficult!

448
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:53,941
So, what are you
going to do with that?

449
00:31:57,941 --> 00:32:00,971
Are you going to make
trouble in our house?

450
00:32:01,111 --> 00:32:03,911
Master Seia said you need to be
disciplined by us!

451
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:05,311
Right?!

452
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,611
We will not be reduced to being
disciplined by ugly beasts like you!

453
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:18,621
Wait up!

454
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:26,101
You...

455
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:31,541
You made the Professor kidnap my Aine.

456
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:34,771
Not only the Professor, you vampire...
but these two as well.

457
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:39,781
No, all of the people in the world
will pledge their loyalty to me.

458
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:41,081
What?

459
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:44,351
I need Tatsuo's power to do so.

460
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:45,951
Tatsuo...

461
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,021
The man...

462
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:47,751
You...

463
00:32:48,191 --> 00:32:51,291
I hate you, you monster.

464
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:53,461
I cannot allow you to
get in my way. So...

465
00:32:57,901 --> 00:32:59,231
Who's the monster?

466
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:04,311
What, vanished?

467
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:14,551
Nobody is permitted to bother Seia.

468
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,721
M...Megumi.

469
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:21,851
Don't worry, Tatsuo.

470
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:24,421
I'm going to help you.

471
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:27,631
Tatsuo, I was born and exist....

472
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:34,631
Only for you, Tatsuo.

473
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:37,471
To become one with you, Tatsuo.

474
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:42,611
So Tatsuo, give to me what is yours...
Tatsuo, please give me what is yours.

475
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:49,951
I was surprised to hear
that you're a vampire.

476
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,751
But this is pathetic.
You'll learn your lesson.

477
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:54,161
I'll show you what's going to
happen if you go against me.

478
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,761
How stupid you are, Seia.

479
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:59,091
You've made Mina get
really angry with you.

480
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:02,831
Now you're gonna see Mina's true power
in your ugly face.

481
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,731
T..T..True power?

482
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:10,571
You can do it all by yourself
if you wish to rule the world.

483
00:34:11,681 --> 00:34:15,611
You can change into a beast
if you don't have enough power.

484
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:16,481
But..!

485
00:34:19,421 --> 00:34:20,441
Sister!

486
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:21,851
Hey, who are you..?

487
00:34:22,651 --> 00:34:24,751
We're Vampire Hunters!

488
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:28,751
We will never allow you
to take the lives of others.

489
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,191
When the moon burns with anger...

490
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:33,361
When the power flows through me...

491
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,991
It will be the end of
your miserable life!

492
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,801
Energy overload in the tower!
Energy overload in the tower!

493
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:41,171
This is a red alert!

494
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:42,361
Evacuate the tower immediately!

495
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:45,241
Finally, the power will be
awakened once more...

496
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:48,711
This wonderful event is starting.

497
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:51,041
A new and wonderful
world is about to begin.

498
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,251
M...Megumi...

499
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,751
I...I'm changing...

500
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:57,081
I...I...

501
00:34:58,891 --> 00:34:59,591
Tatsuo...

502
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:00,881
You're finally...

503
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:07,631
Seia, we're collegemates, but
I will show you no mercy!

504
00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:09,031
How unpleasant!

505
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:11,071
You really are unpleasant, bitch!

506
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:14,441
I won't forgive you!

507
00:35:15,511 --> 00:35:16,801
The same goes for you!

508
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:22,211
I shall show you the power
my father has bestowed upon me.

509
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,621
I will rip out your guts!

510
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,731
Are you so stupid you think you
can kill me, Seia?

511
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:45,671
Do you think you are
stronger than I am? Do you?

512
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:54,641
Uh, oh...Here comes stupid.

513
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:56,471
I am not stupid.

514
00:35:58,081 --> 00:35:59,551
How? It can't be...

515
00:36:06,461 --> 00:36:08,221
Everyone is stupid.

516
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:12,961
You...

517
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:15,331
You've defeated
the beautiful Seia...

518
00:36:15,471 --> 00:36:18,831
The masterpiece my father created.

519
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:21,371
You must apologize to me...
Apologize to Seia...

520
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:22,541
Apologize to my father...

521
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:24,171
W..What?

522
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:32,041
FATHER!

523
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:55,971
What's going on? What's that?

524
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:58,131
Something is coming out.

525
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,481
Is that you...?

526
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:15,561
Tatsuo?

527
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:17,161
Is it you?

528
00:37:17,331 --> 00:37:19,391
Yes, it's coming.

529
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:23,061
The new world order is beginning.

530
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,801
Why...Why has it come?

531
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:35,751
The Beast that destroyed
our ancient home is here now!

532
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:37,711
Why is it here?
