1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,960
Kenta Ochiai here.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,470
Oh no, the old man found out about me and Mahoko!

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,430
Now what do l do?!

4
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,790
Sir, please stay calm.

5
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,830
l will!

6
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,760
Now, Mahoko, come here.

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,100
What? What's going on here?

8
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,950
Mahoko, come home with me now!

9
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,520
l won't go! l'm staying here with Kenta!

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,320
Hey, Sanada...

11
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,420
You're playing awfully dirty, aren't you?

12
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,760
You set that boy on Mahoko, just to get at me!

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,930
You've got to be joking! That's crazy!

14
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,490
Grandpa!

15
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,970
Mr. Sanada and the others have nothing to do with this.

16
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,540
l'm in love with Kenta!

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,910
W-What did you say?!

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,250
Mr. President!

19
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,610
Sir, are you all right?

20
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,010
Old man! Old man!

21
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,180
Don't come any closer!

22
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,680
Namiya!

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,750
Stop!

24
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,060
Just a little squeeze...

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,060
No!

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,190
That's it, Mahoko!

27
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,110
lf you don't come home,

28
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,800
l'll kick Sanada and his friends off this beach!

29
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,210
Old man, give it a rest. Sanada...

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,870
Hold it, Kenta!

31
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,110
Arisugawa, l don't want to fight with you,

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,290
but this beach is my home.

33
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,620
No matter what you say, l'm not leaving.

34
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,260
What?

35
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,850
Grandpa, stop it!

36
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,900
Alright. l'll go home.

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,100
Then you'll leave Kenta and his friends alone, right?

38
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,960
You don't have to go home, Mahoko.

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,400
Old man, Sanada was the All-Japan Surfing Champ.

40
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,270
lt's not about money for him.

41
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,010
He loves this beach.

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,080
All-Japan Surfing Champ?

43
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,360
What's so funny?

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,420
All-Japan Champ, you say? Don't make me laugh!

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,960
Just because he has a trophy doesn't make it true.

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,690
What do you mean by that?

47
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,890
We happen to have a champion surfer at our place too.

48
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,470
He won the Hawaiian Tournament.

49
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,700
So what?

50
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,400
Well now, how about a bet?

51
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,950
lf you win a surfing contest,

52
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,210
l'll let you keep your hotel on the beach.

53
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:16,250
But if we win, you have to leave immediately!

54
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,690
No, l...

55
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:17,890
You've got a deal! No, l...

56
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,950
You've got a deal!

57
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,720
We'll see you on this beach tomorrow at three.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,830
Don't chicken out!

59
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,600
Don't worry! We'll be there!

60
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,610
Kenta?

61
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,780
Suwatee, after we win this contest,

62
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,890
the hotel will be safe!

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,550
Kenta!

64
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,120
Tell me the truth!

65
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,990
What is that girl to you?

66
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh boy, now l'm in trouble.

67
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,030
l won't do it!

68
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,820
l'll never surf again.

69
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,730
lf you want to win, you'll have to do it yourself.

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,740
But, Mr. Sanada!

71
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,370
Mr. Sanada...

72
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,800
Suwatee...

73
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,240
Why do you keep that surfboard?

74
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,910
Because...

75
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,110
You still love surfing, don't you?

76
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,180
What happened, Mr. Sanada?

77
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,690
Fifteen years ago, l killed my lover.

78
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,020
l had just won the championship that year.

79
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,430
There was a typhoon coming, but l took her out onto the water anyway.

80
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,200
<i>lt'll be fine. Don't worry about it.</i>

81
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,710
But l was overconfident.

82
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,680
She was swallowed by a monstrous wave.

83
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,460
Mina...

84
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,290
lt was an accident.

85
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,100
Mr. Sanada, it's not your...

86
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,900
No, l shouldn't have taken her out!

87
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,470
l'm sorry.

88
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,980
Sorry.

89
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,440
l don't have the right to go out on the water anymore.

90
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,020
l see. l didn't know goofy old Sanada had such a dark past.

91
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,420
Now what, Kenta?

92
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,570
lf you tell Arisugawa the story, maybe he'll reconsider.

93
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,330
Like that old man would listen to any story!

94
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,010
But there isn't anyone else who can surf.

95
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,970
l'm going to do it!

96
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,370
You?!

97
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,550
Yeah, you know it's hopeless.

98
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,340
Hey, Shuree!

99
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,790
Shut up and watch me!

100
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,990
l practiced all night, so l'll be fine!

101
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,530
l'll win that contest and get Mahoko back.

102
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,370
Damn it...

103
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,900
Suwatee!

104
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,730
Kenta, you moron!

105
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,330
Could Kenta and Mahoko have...?

106
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,160
Why can't l make up my mind and do something?

107
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,170
<i>But if Kenta doesn't change his ways, there's nothing l can do.</i>

108
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,420
But, l don't want that.

109
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,220
l don't want Kenta to be with another girl. l can't stand it!

110
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,680
Mina...

111
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,660
lt must be wonderful to be loved so much by Mr. Sanada.

112
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,670
l want to be loved by Kenta.

113
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,630
l want to become a woman that Kenta will love.

114
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,320
Shuree, do you think l'm a coward?

115
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,890
l envy Kenta. At least l do right now.

116
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,840
Kenta, are you going to be okay?

117
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,270
This doesn't look good.

118
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,460
Hey, look at that!

119
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,280
Old man!

120
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,020
What happened to Sanada?

121
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,960
l can't believe he's afraid of these waves!

122
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,110
Kenta, get yourself together!

123
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,330
Okay! Wait up, old man!

124
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:43,980
l'm coming!

125
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,510
Kenta! l'm coming!

126
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:44,980
Kenta!

127
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,980
l guess there's no helping it...

128
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,590
Guys, get ready to help Kenta!

129
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,090
You got it!

130
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,880
No, don't!

131
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,780
Suwatee, aren't you worried about Kenta?

132
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,860
Kenta would never cheat to win!

133
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,700
He's not that kind of person.

134
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,910
Believe me, l'm worried sick.

135
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,770
This contest is too much for him!

136
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,910
Suwatee, you...

137
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,100
What's wrong, boy?

138
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,060
You look like you're having a little trouble.

139
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,370
Damn!

140
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,010
Feel free to admit defeat any time.

141
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,280
No way!

142
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,480
Mr. Sanada...

143
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,160
Kenta...

144
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,690
ls that Mr. Sanada?

145
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,370
He shouldn't be out there, he can't win!

146
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,630
He's such an idiot!

147
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,380
He's trying too hard.

148
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,370
Kenta's getting by on dumb luck.

149
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,720
But it's about to get dangerous.

150
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,020
Be careful, Kenta!

151
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,060
Just watch, boy!

152
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,100
This is how you ride the waves!

153
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,640
Wow! Grandpa's so cool!

154
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,140
l could beat you in my sleep!

155
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,420
There's no way l'll lose to you!

156
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,050
This is nothing.

157
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,750
Kenta!

158
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,760
l need this!

159
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,470
Come on, boy! ls that all you can do?

160
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,140
Sanada?

161
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,530
Well, you're pretty good.

162
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,840
Grandpa, be careful!

163
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,640
Wow! Mr. Sanada!

164
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,270
Mr. Sanada...

165
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,160
Stupid! l don't need your help!

166
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,130
No! Grandpa!

167
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,000
Mr. Sanada!

168
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,780
You guys better do something!

169
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,710
No problem!

170
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,220
What's going on? We're not doing that!

171
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,490
Mina...

172
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,870
Well, l have to thank you for that.

173
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,600
Arisugawa, you're a hell of a surfer!

174
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,940
You are too.

175
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,080
Kenta!

176
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,380
l'm so glad you're safe!

177
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,520
l'm fine. Nothing to worry about.

178
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,320
But...

179
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,020
<i>Thank you, Mina.</i>

180
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,730
l didn't know you were such a great surfer, Grandpa!

181
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,130
l haven't felt this good in years!

182
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,200
Mahoko, how about l teach you?

183
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,030
Yes! Of course!

184
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,040
Looks like it runs in the family!

185
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,180
Sanada! You're pretty good!

186
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,610
Well, yeah, kinda.

187
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,280
Want to be my coach?

188
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,280
Really?

189
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,750
Kenta... why?

190
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,690
You were acting weird this afternoon.

191
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,380
So that's what it was.

192
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,590
l'm bored with this job.

193
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,590
l'm going back to Tokyo.

194
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,530
You're lying. What's with you all of a sudden?

195
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,230
l don't have anything to say to you.

196
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,300
Later.

197
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,360
Wait!

198
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,340
Let me go!

199
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,620
The only thing l have to tell you is to take care of Suwatee!

200
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,050
Shuree...

201
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,050
Stop being so nice!

202
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,890
You...

203
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,260
l like you, Kenta.

204
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,470
And that... makes it hard...

205
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,640
...to be around you.

206
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,690
Shuree?

207
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,370
Please, Kenta...

208
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,770
Can l have one night with you before l go?

209
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,660
Shuree?

210
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,630
Shuree...

211
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,030
<i>Now l remember.</i>

212
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,340
<i>l love Kenta...</i>

213
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,640
<i>Having his arms around me...</i>

214
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,060
Oh yes!

215
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,080
Kenta, l want it in me.

216
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,450
Shuree, l can't...

217
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,680
Come! Come inside me!

218
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:05,390
So long, Kenta! Take care of Suwatee! -Shuree

219
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,730
So long, Kenta. Take care of Suwatee! Shuree.

220
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,620
That girl...

221
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,280
That wind chime sounds awfully sad.

222
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,280
lt reminds me that summer's almost over.

223
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,250
Don't be such a bummer!

224
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,510
Let's get moving! Faster!

225
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,320
Okay!

226
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,370
Hey, cutie, want me to teach you?

227
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,150
Get lost, cutie.

228
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,690
What a loser!

229
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,590
So, how am l doing?

230
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,590
You won't be beating me any time soon!

231
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,900
Jeez, grandpa...

232
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,960
Watch out!

233
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,040
Excuse me, Arisugawa!

234
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,010
Coming around you, Mr. President!

235
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,250
Hey, Sanada, keep your hands off my employee!

236
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,260
Looks like the president's a surfjunkie again!

237
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,560
Suwatee, let's take a break!

238
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,570
Okay!

239
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,910
You've really gotten tan.

240
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,680
You too, Kenta.

241
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,710
l wonder how Shuree's doing?

242
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,720
Hey, guys! Taking a break?

243
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,880
Welcome back!

244
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,990
Here, this came for you.

245
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,830
Hey, it's from Shuree!

246
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,240
Hi, it's Shuree! How are you?

247
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,030
l'm in Okinawa now...

248
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,080
l hitched a ride with a truck driver who brought me all the way out here.

249
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,640
l'm working at a beach bar,

250
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,920
and l think l've been pretty good for business!

251
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,150
l'm having a lot of fun.

252
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,430
But sometimes, when l watch the sun sink into the sea,

253
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,960
l think about you guys.

254
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,170
Suwatee, Kenta, Mr. Sanada: it was short but sweet.

255
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,640
Now l'm getting mushy! So goodbye until l see you again!

256
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,780
She sounds happy.

257
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,250
Hey, you two!

258
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,980
Take the day off!

259
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,010
You've been working hard.

260
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,690
Go have some fun!

261
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,320
Okay!

262
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,310
l guess summer's almost over, isn't it?

263
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,900
l can't even remember my life without you.

264
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,110
Suwatee...

265
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,090
l'm sorry, Kenta.

266
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,650
l want to...

267
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,960
But... but... l'm scared.

268
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,720
Suwatee, look at me.

269
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,970
Suwatee, l love you.

270
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,910
l've been an idiot.

271
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,810
lt's okay, Kenta.

272
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,670
Suwatee, you...

273
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,440
They're too small, aren't they?

274
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,540
No, you're cute...

275
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,820
Kenta, please...

276
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,480
Suwatee, you're beautiful.

277
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,830
