1
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,612
Enoshima College

2
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:48,010
Women's Locker Room

3
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:39,860
The Chosen One

4
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:06,319
What I'd give to nibble on
those big mounds of flesh!

5
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:09,327
Too much...!

6
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:20,173
Hey, who turned the lights out?!

7
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,334
Where am I? Who am I?

8
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:26,008
My goodness!

9
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:31,609
Mutsumi Narita!
What are you doing?

10
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:33,580
Iijima.

11
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,216
If it's women's panties you
want to see, here's mine.

12
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:41,491
No, stop!
What are you doing, Iijima?

13
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:54,436
Fooled you.
Got my gym shorts on.

14
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:59,141
Come on, let's get back to rehearsal.

15
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:09,987
You sure are a pervert, Narita.

16
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,589
She's Megumi Iijima.

17
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:17,785
We're old friends, and we're
both in the Drama Club.

18
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:20,595
I think she's got a crush on me.

19
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,592
But I've got my eye on somebody else.

20
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:26,469
Maiko Saotome.

21
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:30,442
She's the reason I joined
the Drama Club.

22
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:38,913
Narita! What are you doing? Hurry up!

23
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,750
Really, Sato?

24
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:46,686
Yeah. If you can do this, you'll make
the lead for sure.

25
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:48,888
I'm leaving!

26
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,759
Hey, wait!

27
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,759
Romeo and Juliet, coming November 3rd.

28
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:07,005
Where's Saotome?

29
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:09,811
She's not here today.

30
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:13,478
What's going on between
you two, anyway?!

31
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:16,353
Don't be stupid, Iijima.

32
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:20,689
I just meant we can't rehearse
without the lead actress.

33
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:25,498
Narita, you like Saotome, don't you?

34
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:27,591
That's ridiculous.

35
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:31,269
Hara! This is your scene.

36
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:32,868
Huh?

37
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,098
What's going on? Saotome and Suzuki
aren't here either.

38
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:43,605
I saw Hara with Sato just now.

39
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:47,744
She said she wanted to rehearse alone.

40
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:56,960
That's her.

41
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:00,029
I'll go get her.

42
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,837
I don't remember a screaming scene.

43
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:22,947
I wonder if that scream's good enough.

44
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:34,166
Who's there? Sato?

45
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:41,740
Sato, I don't know if I can...

46
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,577
What's going on?!

47
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:30,782
Wow! Brilliant acting, huh?

48
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:35,118
Yeah, she could go places with that
talent.

49
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:36,592
Oh my God!

50
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:42,195
It's Hara! She...!

51
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:48,299
Sato! What happened to Hara?

52
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:02,688
I've had a crush on you
for a long time, Narita.

53
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:16,834
Saotome...

54
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:27,539
Wait! Maybe we're rushing into this.

55
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:35,383
Saotome!

56
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:38,355
Save me, Narita!

57
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,150
I'll save you!

58
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:46,263
Hang on! I'll come rescue you!

59
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,666
- Narita!
- Romeo!

60
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:50,870
Saotome!

61
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,098
Juliet!

62
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:55,265
- Narita!
- Romeo!

63
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:57,633
- Saotome!
- Juliet!

64
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:03,439
Oh, Romeo!

65
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:06,509
How long have you
been sitting here, Iijima?

66
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:08,952
A while. I've been rehearsing.

67
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:10,478
But forget that.

68
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:13,424
You had another dirty dream, didn't you?

69
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:17,293
It was about our play
for the cultural fair.

70
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:24,996
I've been having the same
dream ever since that day.

71
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:28,605
It's Hara! She...!

72
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,438
Sato! What is it? What happened to Hara?

73
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:37,814
Sato!

74
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,147
Sato!

75
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,692
Huh? It's locked.

76
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:56,726
Hara! Hara!

77
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,263
What's wrong! Answer me!

78
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:08,275
What the...?!

79
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:09,872
What is it?

80
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,406
Hey, Narita!

81
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:12,577
What'd you see?

82
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:18,249
Got to open it! Damn! It's locked from
inside!

83
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,226
Somebody get the key! Hurry!

84
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,060
What's the matter?

85
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:53,852
Replinoids.

86
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:16,705
The following is an important
announcement from the dean.

87
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:21,553
I would like to ask for
your full attention.

88
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:25,819
About one hour ago...

89
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:29,225
...there was a terrible
accident at this college.

90
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:34,092
One of our female students has been
killed.

91
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:39,270
Let us pray for her soul.

92
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:44,971
Also, there is another concern about...

93
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:48,911
...two female students that have been
missing since yesterday.

94
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:53,118
Keiko Suzuki and Maiko Saotome.

95
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,348
Saotome.

96
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:10,067
I have to catch whoever's done
this and save Saotome!

97
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:14,500
Right. I think your dream was a bit
more on the wet side.

98
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:18,743
What?! I'm really serious about saving
her!

99
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:31,518
It's only because I was
worried about her.

100
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,552
I knew it! Another
perverted dream of yours.

101
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:35,561
What's that?!

102
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:39,526
So I get a hard-on when
I get worried. Big deal!

103
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:41,126
Hey!

104
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,994
Narita. Iijima.

105
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:46,900
What's up, Sato?

106
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:49,336
It's the Drama Club.

107
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:51,773
The police say...

108
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:54,041
...we're not allowed in the Drama Room.

109
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,244
They're canceling classes
until the case is solved.

110
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:03,287
Okay. Thanks.

111
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:08,552
Sato!

112
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,164
Nothing. Forget it.

113
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:19,036
Listen, Iijima.

114
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:21,499
What?

115
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,374
Don't you think he's acting strange?

116
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,002
What do you mean?

117
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,404
I don't know...

118
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:31,939
...but I have a feeling
he's involved in this mess.

119
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:36,446
How could he be?
Hara died in a locked room.

120
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:41,153
Just before she died,
Sato was with Hara.

121
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:44,329
I heard him talking to
Hara from the hallway.

122
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,291
He said...

123
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:51,762
"If you can do this,
you'll make the lead for sure."

124
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:56,969
What? But Saotome's
playing the lead, right?

125
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,778
And nobody knew then
that Saotome was missing!

126
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:00,075
Yeah. And another thing.

127
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:03,570
Sato was the first to discover the body.

128
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:07,181
Wonder what he meant
by "If you can do this..."?

129
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:11,845
I bet if we figure it out,
we can solve this thing.

130
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:28,372
Just don't get too involved.

131
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:31,638
For Saotome's sake
I've got to solve this, or...

132
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:37,281
...l've got to solve this...

133
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,817
...or...!

134
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:41,784
And do something about
that filthy mind of yours.

135
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:47,256
I tell you, I'm seriously
worried about Saotome!

136
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,735
The problem gets bigger and bigger.

137
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:15,148
The replinoids are finally here.

138
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:23,117
Unless the replinoids are stopped...

139
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:27,326
...this College will be drowned in a
sea of blood and despair.

140
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:36,307
To this sword hilt...

141
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:38,867
...the power of justice will
form a phantom sword.

142
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,573
But where is the legendary hero?

143
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:45,378
Iijima! We've caught him!

144
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:48,979
Hey! This is the Women's Locker Room!

145
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:00,156
What did I come here for, again?

146
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,634
You said you caught him.

147
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:07,506
Oh yeah! Sato was the killer after all!

148
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:10,270
I'll be in the Drama room!
Hurry and come!

149
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:12,811
Wait a second!

150
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,161
Do not enter

151
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:38,929
Narita! What'd you do that for?

152
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:42,507
Some Drama students filled me in, Sato.

153
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:46,341
You told Hara she'd be the
lead if she could scream well.

154
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,674
So that's what you meant...

155
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:50,975
But why?

156
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:54,049
I'll tell you what happened.

157
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:55,644
He tricked her.

158
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:56,655
That day...

159
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:59,487
...remember the first scream we heard?

160
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:06,263
Hara was practicing, like he told her.

161
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:11,193
He ran out to get her
and went to where she was.

162
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:15,196
That's when he killed her.

163
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:17,831
Then...

164
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:20,812
He came back, pretending
to have discovered her...

165
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:24,577
...and acting as if there
was a killer on the loose.

166
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:26,647
Not a very good act, though.

167
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:31,622
The last scream we heard
that day was for real.

168
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:45,667
So that's what happened.

169
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:50,840
Wait a second. The door was
locked, and from the inside.

170
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:52,842
That's the only part I can't figure out.

171
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:56,071
He must have stuck something
through the broken glass...

172
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:58,345
...and locked it from the outside.

173
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:00,619
Confess!

174
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,131
Ooh, that feels good!

175
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:29,976
One of these days,
you're going to be the lead!

176
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,576
Yeah, right!

177
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:38,947
Hey, what's that?

178
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:49,424
Who threw that rag onto the wall?

179
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:53,900
It's moving!

180
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:58,401
What the...

181
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:06,311
It's not a bug.
Doesn't look like a slug, either.

182
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:17,261
No, you're wrong.

183
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,193
Wrong? Which part's wrong?

184
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,995
You're wrong. It wasn't me!

185
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:28,196
I didn't do anything! Honestly!

186
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:35,038
Then who did it, Sato? Who's the killer?

187
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:40,551
Narita... help me. Help me!

188
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:43,579
Help you?

189
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:49,085
All right, I'll help.
And you tell me everything.

190
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:50,254
Who's the killer?

191
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,797
This is the truth...
the God honest truth.

192
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:57,529
Actually, the killer is...

193
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:05,604
...the one who killed her is...

194
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:24,463
I'll dispose of you...

195
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:28,923
...just like I did those women.

196
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:34,836
What the hell are you?
And what do you want?

197
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:45,317
This college is nothing more
than fodder to our kind.

198
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:47,342
You will not interfere.

199
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:55,917
I knew it! A replinoid!

200
00:21:58,364 --> 00:21:59,626
Run for it, Narita!

201
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:01,295
Iijima.

202
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,234
What are you thinking?!
At a time like this!

203
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:19,247
I get it! It used a tentacle to
lock the door from outside.

204
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:02,017
Narita! It's dangerous!

205
00:23:58,183 --> 00:24:00,014
I can't breathe!

206
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:07,392
I never expected to
see you in this era.

207
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:11,055
I'll suck every last drop
of blood out of you.

208
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:18,166
No!

209
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:20,528
No! Stop!

210
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,972
Iijima!

211
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:32,543
Iijima!

212
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:34,711
No! Stop!

213
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,165
What the hell's going on?

214
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:00,167
Stop it!

215
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:02,539
No!

216
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:09,749
Hurry and grab the hilt, Narita...

217
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:13,554
Grab it and pray to rescue Saotome.

218
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,926
Pray to rescue Saotome?

219
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,296
Hurry, Narita.

220
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:34,678
Go to hell, you slimy beast!

221
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:54,328
This is Keiko Suzuki's pendant.

222
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,658
Suzuki.

223
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,364
Saotome.

224
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:11,646
What have you done
with Suzuki and Saotome?!

225
00:26:11,683 --> 00:26:12,707
Narita!

226
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:17,118
Saotome.

227
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:23,092
Saotome.

228
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:28,492
Narita! Look out!

229
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,608
My picture.

230
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:21,484
My precious picture!

231
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,517
You bastard!

232
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:26,991
Narita! Take the hilt and pray again!

233
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,006
You can do it!

234
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:12,466
My precious picture!

235
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,416
Saotome! I'll save you!

236
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:53,835
He is the legendary hero.

237
00:28:58,383 --> 00:28:59,782
You bastard!

238
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:04,988
Not the tentacles! Aim for his body!

239
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:10,759
Return Saotome, you beast!

240
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:30,680
Narita!

241
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:33,580
You'll be fine.

242
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,286
Narita, you destroyed the replinoid.

243
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:13,624
Good job.

244
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:40,151
It's you, Flash Rabbit!

245
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:43,720
Come here.
Nothing to be afraid of.

246
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,981
You had to follow me, huh?

247
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:49,892
So even a harmless thing
like you came back in time.

248
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:56,926
That means all those replinoids
could be here too!

249
00:30:57,302 --> 00:31:00,032
This is terrible! I have
to do something fast!

250
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:04,030
Or else they'll devour
the entire college!

251
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:18,420
You're awake, finally.

252
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,486
Ow!

253
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:22,723
How'd I get in here?

254
00:31:23,728 --> 00:31:25,252
Don't you remember?

255
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:28,230
No, I feel kind of dazed.

256
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:33,261
Oh. Well let's just go home.
It's dark out now.

257
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:36,237
Yeah, okay.

258
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:16,445
I remember!

259
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,394
Megumi Iijima.

260
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:37,453
Figured you'd be here.

261
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:41,290
I remembered what happened yesterday.

262
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:51,772
I guess it's time I told you the truth.

263
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:54,074
The truth?

264
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:56,478
I'm not really Megumi Iijima.

265
00:33:57,582 --> 00:34:00,983
Come to my place after college.

266
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:06,983
Iijima...

267
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:18,594
See you tonight!

268
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:24,707
You're such a bloody pervert!

269
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:25,767
Get back here!

270
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:39,115
Getting back to what
you said this morning...

271
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:41,523
...what do you mean
you're not Megumi Iijima?

272
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,756
This'll be hard to believe,
but I'm here on a special mission.

273
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:50,063
I came through a time
warp from the year 2112.

274
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:52,294
Don't be stupid.

275
00:34:52,337 --> 00:34:56,569
We've been friends since grade school.

276
00:34:57,142 --> 00:35:01,602
A month ago I reprogrammed
all the students' memories.

277
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:08,376
The daughter in this family
was my age, but she died.

278
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:11,488
So what's this mission of yours?

279
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:14,424
To follow the replinoid
invasion of this world...

280
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:17,394
...from the future, and
come up with a solution.

281
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:20,723
So you came from the future?

282
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,844
This is my true appearance.

283
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,847
What's that animal?

284
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:44,021
It's a kind of replinoid too.

285
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:45,886
But it's harmless, don't worry.

286
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:50,394
I want to show you something.
Come with me.

287
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:06,845
Never knew a place like this
was so close to the college.

288
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:08,676
But it's pitch black in there.

289
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:12,808
No problem. He'll show us the way.

290
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:17,785
Let's go.

291
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,392
It's a dead-end.

292
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,479
This is my Time Capsule.

293
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,915
Unreal!

294
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:55,216
Tell me the rest of your story.

295
00:36:56,561 --> 00:37:01,464
Our world isn't peaceful and
happy like this world.

296
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:05,932
In our era, there lives an
evil beast called Black Murder...

297
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,336
...which gives birth to
thousands of creatures.

298
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:11,672
We call them replinoids.

299
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:15,872
The replinoids feed on
the bodies and blood of humans.

300
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:18,644
And they have a particular
fondness for young women.

301
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:23,881
The replinoids have almost
wiped out our generation.

302
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,320
With those tentacles?

303
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:30,958
Right.

304
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:36,163
They entered a time warp
to come to Enoshima College.

305
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,794
They possessed Sato as a cover...

306
00:37:38,836 --> 00:37:41,327
...and they're waiting to seize the
chance to leech us alive.

307
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:44,933
If we don't do something,
they'll devour us all!

308
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:49,970
It's too unreal.

309
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:52,482
Narita. Take this.

310
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:55,278
I used that last night!

311
00:37:55,553 --> 00:38:00,354
That's right. Take it once more,
and think of Saotome.

312
00:38:05,697 --> 00:38:10,532
This sword has long been kept
in one of our museums.

313
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:16,529
Only one man has ever
been able to bring it to life.

314
00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:18,742
It's the sword of a hero.

315
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:27,980
The sword of a hero?

316
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,487
Yes. And you are that hero.

317
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:36,717
You destroyed the replinoid
that invaded the college.

318
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:40,697
You are the chosen one
who can rescue Saotome.

319
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:43,858
Saotome.
