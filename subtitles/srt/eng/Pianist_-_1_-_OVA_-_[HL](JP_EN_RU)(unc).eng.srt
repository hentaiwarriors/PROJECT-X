1
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:28,630
Seiji!

2
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:31,132
Yuna!

3
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:11,056
Thanks for the dinner.
It was delicious.

4
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:24,763
Yet another boring day
with nothing to do.

5
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:50,528
The city is peaceful and
bustling with people.

6
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:54,729
But two-thirds of the population
are robots now.

7
00:04:55,671 --> 00:05:00,301
The new millennium saw a decline
in the sperm count of humans.

8
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:06,043
Maybe it's nature's way of
limiting population growth.

9
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:08,911
This has resulted in
a serious decrease...

10
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:12,579
...in the birth rates
of advanced nations.

11
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,581
It led to a world depression.

12
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:19,957
Large numbers in weaker
countries were wiped out.

13
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:23,890
Humanity was quietly
and steadily...

14
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,127
...beginning to eliminate
its members.

15
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:46,354
Robots were quickly developed
in response to the situation.

16
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:48,320
And mass production began
in order to...

17
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:51,825
...address labor shortages
and for domestic service.

18
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:59,460
Both my parents were pianists...

19
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:01,434
...and I followed in their footsteps.

20
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:03,670
But three years ago...

21
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:05,365
I injured my right hand.

22
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:10,970
Since then...

23
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,607
I have not performed in public
as a concert pianist.

24
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:25,223
At the hospital, a nurse helped me
through my difficulties.

25
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:29,896
She was a DX-V999 android.

26
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:34,095
Afterwards, I bought the same
model to be my maid.

27
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,539
Her name is Yuna.

28
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,645
Does it still hurt, Seiji?

29
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:47,340
You shouldn't push it.

30
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,648
I guess so. Sorry.

31
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,421
I hope you recover soon.

32
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:55,684
You look so happy
when you're playing.

33
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:58,618
It's the one thing I do really well.

34
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,325
Hey, why don't you try playing?

35
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:05,531
I don't have the necessary data
to play piano.

36
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:07,459
I guess not.

37
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,663
How about the data
from my performances?

38
00:07:09,772 --> 00:07:11,672
We could download it.

39
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:13,765
I have a sequencer, too.

40
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,176
Come over here, Yuna.

41
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:22,146
Sure.

42
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,959
This should do it.

43
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:34,421
Now, sit in front of the piano.

44
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:35,662
All right.

45
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,539
That's amazing!

46
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:52,546
Wow! It's perfect,
with no mistakes!

47
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,509
Really? I'm glad.

48
00:07:56,052 --> 00:07:58,714
All right. I'm going
to teach you piano.

49
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:01,654
I'm sure you'll be able
to play like a pro.

50
00:08:01,757 --> 00:08:03,657
If you're going to teach me...

51
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,488
I'll be sure to do my best.

52
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:07,994
You're really cute.

53
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:47,699
Oh, Seiji!

54
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:51,697
This feels really good.

55
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:13,320
Release yourself.

56
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:16,159
Make all the noise you
want when you cum.

57
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:22,228
Seiji!

58
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:36,983
It really feels so good.

59
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:38,717
Me, too!

60
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:42,949
I... I...

61
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:19,926
How was I?

62
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:22,526
Needs a little more nuance.

63
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:29,801
All right, I'm taking you
to a real concert...

64
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:33,466
...since I can't play well enough
for you to be inspired.

65
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:35,443
A concert?

66
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:38,673
I've never been to a concert.

67
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:42,444
Get ready then. I'll book
the tickets on-line.

68
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,376
All right!

69
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:32,593
What did you think?

70
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:36,665
It was a great learning experience.

71
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:38,569
Good. I have high hopes for you.

72
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:48,179
Takeo, maybe we should
just go home.

73
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:51,843
How dare a machine like
you tell me what to do!?

74
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:56,921
Just shut up and follow me!

75
00:12:02,364 --> 00:12:04,889
I can have you replaced
just like that.

76
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,026
You talk back to me and
I'll have you taken away!

77
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:11,471
Yes. I'm sorry, master.

78
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:12,562
I'll never--

79
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:16,469
Just shut up and come!
Let's get a drink!

80
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,408
I'm scared.

81
00:12:22,184 --> 00:12:25,847
People who treat robots
like animals are scum.

82
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:32,289
Seiji treats me really well.

83
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:34,325
Like a human.

84
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:43,334
What's wrong?

85
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:46,407
A little shaken after
going out tonight?

86
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:50,944
Well, no... You are a kind man,
aren't you?

87
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,847
What do you mean?

88
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:55,079
Thank you.

89
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:59,484
I don't think of you as less
than human. That's all.

90
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,631
Seiji...

91
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,648
It feels so good.

92
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,227
Seiji...

93
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:01,509
Yes... Yes...!

94
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,767
Well, you've gotten much better.

95
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,337
Thanks to you.

96
00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:32,137
We can do it if you're this good.

97
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:34,436
Right. I'm going to arrange
your professional debut.

98
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:47,113
Go get ready.
Let's go there directly.

99
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:48,189
Sure, but...

100
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:50,114
Hurry up.

101
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:51,157
Yes.

102
00:16:12,781 --> 00:16:13,975
Well, Mr. Kurosaki!

103
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,051
It's been a while.

104
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:19,552
I was wondering if you could
arrange a recording.

105
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:22,280
Your wrist is healed then?

106
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:23,984
It's not for me.

107
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:25,957
It's for this lady here.

108
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:28,086
She's a student of yours?

109
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:31,261
That's right. I guarantee her talent.

110
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,527
Please arrange the session.

111
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:43,404
Mr. Kurosaki,
isn't this woman a robot?

112
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:47,778
What does it matter
if she's a robot?

113
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,875
I've never heard of
a robot debuting.

114
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:55,421
Her talent nearly matches mine.

115
00:16:55,524 --> 00:16:57,685
I have full confidence in her.

116
00:16:58,694 --> 00:16:59,956
But, I can't...

117
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:04,465
The Goldberg variations!
I want her to start big!

118
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,158
Wait a minute.

119
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:08,363
However good she is...

120
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,735
...it's no different than a concert
by a player piano.

121
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,402
How dare you!?

122
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:16,272
It wouldn't be received
by the public very well.

123
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:19,472
It's all right, Seiji.
It's okay. Let it go.

124
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:23,812
This isn't the only record
company. There are others.

125
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:24,715
Let's go, Yuna.

126
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:37,296
If you just listen to her,
you'll understand.

127
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:39,060
Please give her an audition.

128
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:40,728
Mr. Kurosaki...

129
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:42,895
I have a reputation to uphold.

130
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:48,136
There's no way I'm going to
record a robot performance.

131
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,576
What's the difference between
robots and humans?

132
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:56,117
How dare you. We owe a debt
of gratitude to robots.

133
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:59,583
It's all right, Seiji.
Let's just go home.

134
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:04,725
I'm not giving up.
You're going to have your debut.

135
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,559
Yuna?

136
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:11,194
You sure have strange interests,
Mr. Kurosaki. A robot?

137
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:13,763
Yuna!

138
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:16,397
Yuna!

139
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:24,909
Where are you? Yuna!

140
00:18:32,587 --> 00:18:34,487
Where are you?!

141
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:49,236
Yuna... What's happened?

142
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,336
Is this the warranty company?

143
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:57,935
My robot has gone missing.

144
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,673
Please find her right away.

145
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:03,518
Yes. She's a model DX-V999.

146
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:06,416
A replacement?
No, that's not what I want.

147
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:07,545
I want my robot back!

148
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:08,645
She's the one I want!

149
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:13,122
Yuna, where have you gone?

150
00:19:29,244 --> 00:19:30,541
Where did she go?

151
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,551
What have I done?

152
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:44,489
I've treated her so well.
Better than any human.

153
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:20,825
Give me the strongest
drink you've got.

154
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:28,292
One more.

155
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:37,912
You've gotta move
your ass properly.

156
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:47,449
You're lousy. When are you
going to learn, anyway?

157
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,121
That's it.

158
00:20:56,198 --> 00:20:58,962
Yeah... That's the way.

159
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:02,130
See, you can do it if you try.

160
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:28,160
Stop!

161
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,240
Yuna.

162
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:11,968
This music...

163
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:34,890
Seiji.

164
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:48,507
I cleaned it up properly.

165
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,440
Yuna.

166
00:22:57,218 --> 00:22:59,049
- Yuna.
- Seiji.

167
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:02,219
I'm sorry to have worried you.

168
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:05,452
This is really the only place for me.

169
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,256
- Will you take me back?
- Of course.

170
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:11,388
Don't worry about my debut anymore.

171
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:13,262
There's nothing we can do.

172
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:16,599
I'm happy just playing piano here.

173
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:18,628
But...

174
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,574
You seemed so happy
teaching me how to play.

175
00:23:26,014 --> 00:23:29,575
But you mustn't live
your dreams through me.

176
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:32,346
My only wish is that...

177
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,445
...your hand will completely recover.

178
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:36,888
That you will play again...

179
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:38,550
...and return to the concert stage.

180
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:40,559
Yuna.

181
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:42,830
Seiji.
