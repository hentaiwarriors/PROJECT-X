1
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,559
Please be wake up.

2
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,429
Bird...

3
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,130
What are you saying?

4
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,132
Bird! I have seen a bird!

5
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,400
Bird! I have seen a bird!

6
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,703
Bird? What's wrong?

7
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,137
What's going on?

8
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:24,818
World of Dream 3

9
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,889
Please beware of Godi.

10
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:36,229
Many ward numens has descended
to your world with you.

11
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,936
Hitomi...

12
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:43,570
Is really the descending body of ward numen.

13
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,771
Is really the descending body of ward numen.

14
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,839
Is really the descending body of ward numen.

15
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,941
But what should I do?

16
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,010
to look for other ward numens?

17
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,579
To ask them one by one?

18
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,448
And...

19
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,617
please remember...

20
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,419
Your strength derives from

21
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,389
loving and being loved.

22
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,224
You are a warrior of love.

23
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,027
When you find your lost loves,

24
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,497
you will be stronger than any others.

25
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,237
To turn loving and being loved to strength?

26
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,974
Do you mean
I should make love with all my heart?

27
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,379
What, it is you Shido?

28
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,182
I admire you with so much free time.

29
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,917
But I have to find out

30
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,287
the ward numens descending to this city.

31
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:38,358
Do you know what is ward numen?

32
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,397
It's impossible to know.

33
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,769
Do you want me go with you?

34
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,577
Where are you going?

35
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,949
Futaba, no need to pretend anymore.

36
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:03,650
Futaba, no need to pretend anymore.

37
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,686
Don't you like him?

38
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,756
Yes...

39
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,258
What do you mean YES?

40
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,728
I quarreled with him every time I meet him.

41
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,798
And it seems he loves other girls.

42
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:24,871
Maybe I... am not as good as those girls.

43
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,610
But you're denying.

44
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,914
In fact you fear of be abandoned and hurted.

45
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,751
So you look for reasons to elude your feeling.

46
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,385
So you look for reasons to elude your feeling.

47
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:38,585
So you look for reasons to elude your feeling.

48
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,592
That's right, maybe it is.

49
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,597
Now Futaba should be braver.

50
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,467
Be braver?

51
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,335
Welcome!

52
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,237
Good afternoon, Kengo.

53
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:32,939
Mia!

54
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,909
Is this shop yours?

55
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,344
I am working here.

56
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,846
Because I like animals very much.

57
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,949
Staying with these animals,

58
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,819
I feel something close.

59
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,055
It seemed that long long ago,

60
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,559
I lived with many animals.

61
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:56,262
But, do you feel I am cunning?

62
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,699
Defend these animals...

63
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,869
and say I like animals

64
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,170
I have to.

65
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,473
This is the rules of this world.

66
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,542
Who made these rules?

67
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:15,849
Sorry, I am not blaming you.

68
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,617
I know.

69
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,889
I sometimes dream.

70
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,190
Dream?

71
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,827
about a beautiful forest.

72
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,396
In that world...

73
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:33,099
Animals and human are living freely.

74
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,639
And you are also in my dream.

75
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,608
Me?

76
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,191
It seems we have met before.

77
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,993
Before we met for the first time,

78
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,629
You and me...

79
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,764
with you...

80
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,033
seemed to be friends long long ago.

81
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,935
Me too.

82
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:10,770
Really?

83
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,439
Then maybe...

84
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,810
we have the same dream.

85
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,179
Dream?

86
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,849
Mia.

87
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,318
Do you know what is ward numen?

88
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,788
Ward numen?

89
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,957
What is that?

90
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,827
You don't know it?

91
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,595
No, it's OK.

92
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,430
About the dream you mentioned just now,

93
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,232
What is the dream about?

94
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,604
I can't remember clearly.

95
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,008
In the dream...

96
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,609
I think...

97
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,977
we must be...

98
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,046
boyfriend and girlfriend.

99
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,382
Then...

100
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,119
that is only a dream.

101
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:04,157
But I really like you.

102
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,064
I like you too.

103
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,955
Mia, is it OK?

104
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,228
I have decided to give you my virginity.

105
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:50,070
I have decided to give Aoterubu my virginity.

106
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:51,971
Now?

107
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,374
What's wrong?

108
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,309
No.

109
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,977
Nothing.

110
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,019
Futaba!

111
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,021
Why are you here?

112
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,360
Futaba, wait!

113
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,198
Mia, sorry.

114
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,667
Let's postpone it.

115
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,812
Why, why is it Mia?

116
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,016
Why, why is it Hitomi?

117
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,418
Why not me?

118
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,891
Neika Sensei.

119
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,573
Are feeling calm now?

120
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,977
Yes, sorry to trouble you.

121
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,680
No problem, don't keep it in your mind.

122
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,015
Here have some.

123
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,284
Yes, excuse me.

124
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,029
Is that wonderful?

125
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,331
Yes...

126
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:26,866
But

127
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,804
Sex is the love song made of blood and flesh.

128
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:36,142
The repeating wave move me to the peak of pleasure.

129
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,212
In the burning happy flame,

130
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,448
I have gained nirvana many times.

131
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,849
I have gained nirvana many times.

132
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,353
Right, it's like the phoenix in the legend.

133
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,489
Sex is so great.

134
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,624
Don't you think so?

135
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,828
I am not so clear.

136
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:59,132
But you want to know it, right?

137
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,540
Futaba, teacher know you very well.

138
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:12,078
I know you feel very lonely.

139
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,883
So teacher want you to forget him.

140
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:16,916
So teacher want you to forget him.

141
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,188
by giving you a sweet dream.

142
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,658
No!

143
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,894
Teacher, please stop!

144
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,296
Please stop!

145
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,299
Do you really want me to stop?

146
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,540
OK, I'll stop then.

147
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,677
No! Don't stop.

148
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,315
Then shouldn't you be begging?

149
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,184
Yes.

150
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,587
I beg you, please go on.

151
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,257
You'd say you'll obey all of my orders.

152
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,795
I'll obey all of your orders.

153
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:07,867
Good. You're so lively, Futaba.

154
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,076
It's really hard.

155
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,758
What?

156
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:09,729
What's the matter with you?
Isn't it your important member?

157
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,967
This is something of a man.

158
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:18,238
Why... on my body?

159
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,676
No need for you to fear, Futaba.

160
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,844
This is only a dream.

161
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,280
Dream?

162
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:31,818
Right, you are now in dream.

163
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,289
In the dream, you are a ward numen
who have two sexual characters.

164
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,657
Miya.

165
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:43,963
In the dream, you can spread your love freely...

166
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,167
with men and women you loved.

167
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,668
Well...

168
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,686
I want it.

169
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,659
Is it very good?

170
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,528
OK, open black wing.

171
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,531
Fly with your desire.

172
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,674
I'm coming.

173
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,844
Oh, yeah.

174
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,777
It's just like this, do it at your own will.

175
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:09,849
It's a compensation for the love
you didn't get from Aoterubu.

176
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,263
Aoterubu

177
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,831
Love...

178
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,281
I have decided...

179
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,851
to give Aoterubu my virginity.

180
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,926
It has been late before we know it.

181
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,697
Sorry to keep you wating.

182
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,567
Mia.

183
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,707
Kengo, what's going on?

184
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,776
This late.

185
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,479
but I care for one thing at all time.

186
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,315
but you can call me.

187
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,950
I don't have your number.

188
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,419
And I want to see you too.

189
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:26,826
Mia, can you tell me the dream in details
which you mentioned to me earlier?

190
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:31,398
That dream?
What's wrong with that dream?

191
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,533
I hope you can remember it carefully.

192
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,604
To me. No, to us.

193
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,839
that is very important.

194
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,642
It is so...

195
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:50,984
Wait a minute.

196
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:51,384
Wait a minute.

197
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:51,418
Wait a minute.

198
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,187
Kengo.

199
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,838
Stop, Aoterubu.

200
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,849
You can't bully a friend.

201
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,385
What are you saying?

202
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:28,254
Please look carefully.

203
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,060
Futaba?! Futaba, is it you?

204
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,631
Right.

205
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:42,235
But her looks... could it...

206
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,037
Right.

207
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,906
That woman was a ward numen in her last life too.

208
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,909
She can't get your love.

209
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,246
so she turned to be a night ghost with to much sorrow.

210
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,447
It also means...

211
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,349
the one who made her to be a night ghost...

212
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,319
is you, Aoterubu.

213
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:03,189
Can't get my love?

214
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,559
Forgive me, Futaba.

215
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,765
It's all because of me not noticing your love.

216
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:18,505
Mia.

217
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,607
No, no.

218
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,143
You must do it with me.

219
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:23,777
You must do it with me.

220
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:31,217
You'll enjoy the happiness, Aoterubu.

221
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:32,485
Let me go!

222
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,161
Does it taste good?

223
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:45,865
It is effective to both man and woman.

224
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,268
What?

225
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,605
Look.

226
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,375
You're so energized.

227
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,159
Stop!

228
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:26,873
Shido.

229
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,897
Stop.

230
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,198
Futaba!

231
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,667
Miya.

232
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,695
If it wasn't for you,

233
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,397
Aoterubu would have loved me.

234
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,567
Aoterubu is mine!

235
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,236
Aoterubu...

236
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,808
Aoterubu...

237
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,629
Wonderful, wonderful.

238
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,899
Get it?

239
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,136
It's time to get your love strength.

240
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,479
You...

241
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:14,848
I see.

242
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,118
You are not the real Aoterubu.

243
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,488
What do you mean?

244
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,142
I have remembered.

245
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,278
tyat I was the ward numen in dream world.

246
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:48,748
Lusano's forest, Miyu.

247
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:53,553
So Mia is Miyu.

248
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:18,144
Well, it's too good.

249
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,618
Miyu.

250
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,446
Futaba, Futaba.

251
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,520
Are you OK?

252
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:02,122
Kengo.

253
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:03,556
Mia.

254
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:05,859
Sorry, Mia.

255
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,794
Sorry I have done the wrong thing to you.

256
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,998
No problem, this is not your fault.

257
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,100
Yes, don't mind.

258
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,269
Thank you...

259
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,339
Kengo.

260
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,877
Are you willing to love me?

261
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,579
I'll love you.

262
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,048
I love you now.

263
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,917
Me too.

264
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,044
That woman said something strange.

265
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,316
You are not the true Aoterubu.

266
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,519
What did she mean?

267
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:48,488
And...

268
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,729
Who is that man?
