1
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,308
Princess Etruria.

2
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:06,863
Tower of Etruria
Vol. 2 - The Enchantress Drowning in Lust

3
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,819
<i>When I fought with my father
and ran away from the castle,</i>

4
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,073
<i>I came to this tower and made my first friend.</i>

5
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:21,789
<i>A friend that I met in this cave of nothing but monsters.</i>

6
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,099
An enchanted sword, eh?

7
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,601
What's your name?

8
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,855
Don't worry.

9
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,206
Well, it'll be just the two of us
for a while, so let's be friends!

10
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,960
That's it! Why don't I give you a name?

11
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,634
Your name will be...

12
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,303
The sword's name was...

13
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,991
Don't worry. Just watch me.

14
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:51,879
See?

15
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,922
<i>I knew it.</i>

16
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,799
<i>Yes, I knew it.</i>

17
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,271
Well? Isn't that great?

18
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,786
Don't! Hey, stop it.

19
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:31,418
Hey, stop. I said no!

20
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,732
This can't be.

21
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,270
That's enough. You're a good kid.

22
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,107
Hey, wait

23
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,945
Th-That's enough.

24
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,797
Who are you?

25
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,299
Princess Etruria.

26
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,060
Wh-What?

27
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,028
Why? Why did you abandon me?

28
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,869
That man... What does he have that I don't!?

29
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,272
What's wrong, Cecilia? Are you having a bad dream?

30
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,949
She's blushing and in pain.
This is kinda turning me on.

31
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,623
No! No!

32
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,792
Cecilia! Cecilia! Are you okay?

33
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,503
Snap out of it, Cecilia!

34
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,760
Cecilia?

35
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,887
I must go.

36
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,515
I must go.

37
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,602
Hey, Cecilia! What's going on?

38
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,478
Hey!

39
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,859
I... must go.

40
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,027
Cecilia?

41
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,070
I...

42
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,990
Cecilia! What's wrong?

43
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,283
I must go.

44
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,785
What are you saying?

45
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,495
Cecilia! Snap out of it!

46
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,166
Shut up, you guys. I can't sleep.

47
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,709
What's wrong?

48
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,421
Hey, Cecilia!

49
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,547
I must go.

50
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,674
I must go.

51
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,926
I must go.

52
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,390
<i>A dark cell...</i>

53
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,105
<i>Balhara Cave.</i>

54
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,571
That's what happened.

55
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,282
Are you listening, Albion?

56
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,286
Yeah. What do you think, Palmira?

57
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,497
This is silly.

58
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,670
I said it was silly.

59
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,381
It's your own nightmare. Deal with it.

60
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,926
I'm not sure if you know that girl or not

61
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,971
but could you please leave us out of it?

62
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:57,267
I mean, it's silly to expect us to believe it anyway.

63
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,269
Right, Sir Albion?

64
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,522
Oh, can we have another three helpings of this?

65
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,648
Y-Yås.

66
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,485
P-Palmira.

67
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,740
Albion, you agree with her?

68
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,867
Well, I...

69
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:21,333
Well, Cecilia, you're worried about what
she told you in that dream, aren't you?

70
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,083
Yeah.

71
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,838
But you don't know her name or where
she comes from or what she wants.

72
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,381
Don't be so cynical.

73
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,343
So she wanted you to rescue her?

74
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:31,968
Yeah.

75
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,847
But it sounded like she was jealous.

76
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,974
Doesn't she hold a grudge against you?

77
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,936
It's a hassle for me, so I'd rather stay out of this.

78
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,521
Palmira!

79
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,564
Yes?

80
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:50,070
I'll admit I'm not one to go chasing
after something I saw in a dream.

81
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,282
But I did see it. She was being strangled.

82
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,622
Anyway, let's go check it out.

83
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,124
And if it turns out to be nothing, that's all the better.

84
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,086
And if there is something there,
we can do something about it.

85
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,966
Either way, it's better than just
sitting around here. Right?

86
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:16,930
Good, then Balhara Cave will be our next destination.

87
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,597
Meeting adjourned!

88
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,725
If you want you can stay here.

89
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,768
We'll go without you.

90
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,353
I'm coming! I'm coming!

91
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,565
Sorry to keep you waiting.

92
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,607
Thanks.

93
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,359
Well, lets eat!

94
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,945
Aren't you eating a little too much?

95
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,029
I'm fine, I'm fine.

96
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,740
Haven't you heard the phrase,
"Never go to battle on an empty stomach"?

97
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,742
Um...

98
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,122
If you don't mind my asking, are you going to that cave?

99
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,249
Yes, we are.

100
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,918
Sorry if I'm being intrusive...

101
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,670
but I'd give up if I were you.

102
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,338
I wish we could.

103
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,464
They're out there.

104
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,632
They? What is?

105
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,887
I cant explain it very well, but they're out there.

106
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,223
Things that attack people.

107
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,392
Many people have died already.

108
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,686
Well, it's a dungeon.

109
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,105
It makes sense if a hundred or so monsters are in there.

110
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,358
Will you tell us more details?

111
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,027
All right.

112
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:20,285
<i>Balhara Cave is a five kilometer climb
up the mountain from this town.</i>

113
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,037
<i>It's a famous dungeon.</i>

114
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,707
<i>It actually used to be a tourist attraction.</i>

115
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:30,545
<i>It's the main reason why this town exists today.</i>

116
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,131
This is the place.

117
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,090
Look at that!

118
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,597
It's exactly like a tourist attraction.

119
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,350
Anyway, let's explore it.

120
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,392
Good idea.

121
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:50,440
They say that many soldiers have been seen in there.

122
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,400
Soldiers?

123
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,154
Yes, though I haven't seen them myself.

124
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,115
Nonetheless, I hear they look like mummies.

125
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,202
Mummies, eh?

126
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,955
Then I suppose there are also vampires
and succubus monsters in there.

127
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,921
And a cave boss and undead minions.

128
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,964
A curse too, of course.

129
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,890
Can you think of anything else?
I don't care how crazy it sounds.

130
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:30,980
According to rumor, a sword was
taken from Balhara a month ago.

131
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:36,695
It was apparently a sword from the Tower of Etruria,
where a really scary enchantress lived.

132
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,447
Those things might be connected!

133
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,950
A really scary enchantress, eh...

134
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,911
That does sound heavy.

135
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,584
That was a nice workout.

136
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,379
Well, it seems like a normal dungeon to me.

137
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,174
But I don't see any mummified monsters.

138
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,636
If we go deeper in, well find our answer.

139
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,637
I agree.

140
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:03,637
Let's go.

141
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:04,681
Yes, Sire.

142
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,685
Cecilia, we're leaving you behind.

143
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,228
Wait!

144
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,442
Wait up, Albion!

145
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,209
Stop it please.

146
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,234
You want to cum. I know you want to cum.

147
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,487
Then I'll help you cum.

148
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,526
I'll make it feel even better for you.

149
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,833
Now. Cum into me.

150
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,981
I'm here. Hurry to me.

151
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,664
Hey, Cecilia! Cecilia!

152
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,207
Princess Etruria.

153
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,129
Princess Etruria, I've been waiting for you.

154
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,839
Come to me.

155
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,965
What are you saying?

156
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,426
Who are you? Tell me!

157
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:50,221
Come to my side. Come pledge yourself to me!

158
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,560
Hey, Cecilia! Snap out of it!

159
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,479
I must go.

160
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,649
Cecilia!

161
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,777
Cecilia! Wait up!

162
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,945
Palmira, were going after her!

163
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,905
Okay!

164
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,493
Sir Albion, what's going on?

165
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,120
Beats me!

166
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:14,954
Me too.

167
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,421
So she has friends.

168
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,214
And mummies at that.

169
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:29,135
What a hassle. I hate mindless enemies like this.

170
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,639
No help for that! We'll have to defeat
them quickly and go after Cecilia!

171
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,431
Let's go.

172
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,390
Right!

173
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:41,189
Please. Tell me. Who are you?

174
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,569
You abandoned me.

175
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,448
You didn't even want me.

176
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,435
I waited for you this whole time, Princess Etruria.

177
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:23,189
Was it you? Did you summon me here?

178
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,541
I finally have you, Princess Etruria.

179
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,295
I won't let you go. You belong to me.

180
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,300
We will be one forever, Princess Etruria.

181
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,596
I will not be lonely again!

182
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,394
Where did she go?

183
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,229
What's that?

184
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,358
What's this place? A palace?

185
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,527
Looks too creepy to be a palace.

186
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,784
Eiloppa, where is your Master?

187
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,037
Albion.

188
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,418
Cecilia! What's happened to you?

189
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,336
Why did you run off like that?

190
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,047
What's wrong?

191
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,924
You really had us worried!

192
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,843
Listen, Albion.

193
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,552
Cecilia?

194
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,850
Sir Albion!

195
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,650
Albion...

196
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,861
I have a favor to ask.

197
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,239
Drop dead.

198
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,661
Palmira!

199
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,829
Stay out of my way!

200
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,041
I say the same to you! What are you trying to do?

201
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,920
In that case, then you too must die!

202
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,719
So it's not a vampire or a succubus.

203
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,097
It's something completely different.

204
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,100
Though I guess it's an answer we didn't want.

205
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,643
Palmira!

206
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,936
I understand.

207
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,398
<i>It looks like I'll have to fight it with all my strength.</i>

208
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,707
What's wrong? Finished already?

209
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,254
Die!

210
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,757
Palmira!

211
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,599
If only you were dead, then Princess Etruria...

212
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:04,517
Shit!

213
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,478
Die!

214
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,271
No!

215
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,110
Wh-Why?

216
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,204
Hey! Cecilia!

217
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,666
Cecilia! Hey, Cecilia! Wake up

218
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,502
She's not waking up.

219
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,170
Cecilia!

220
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,090
Sir Albion...

221
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,886
Princess Etruria! Princess Etruria!

222
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,143
Please, save her!

223
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,187
If this keeps up... If this keeps up...

224
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:54,817
If this keeps up, Princess Etruria will...

225
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:58,821
Please save her! Please save Princess Etruria!

226
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,199
Don't worry. Don't worry.

227
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,951
Cecilia will be fine.

228
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,286
Shirera...

229
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,499
I knew it was you, Shirera.

230
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,834
Princess Etruria!

231
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,297
Your name will be... Shirera!

232
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,840
I'll call you Shirera!

233
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,800
Princess Etruria!

234
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,262
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot about you.

235
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,349
Hey! Cecilia!

236
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,849
Don't tell me...

237
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,811
She's okay. She just lost consciousness for now.

238
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,355
"For now"?

239
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,066
Sir Albion,

240
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,070
may I ask a favor of you?

241
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,822
What do you need?

242
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,282
I ask..

243
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,286
I ask that you lie with me.

244
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:59,882
We will use my life force as a link
to bind you to Princess Etruria.

245
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,385
Sir Albion won't be in danger, will he?

246
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:06,305
No. You have my word. Sir Albion will be safe

247
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,891
And so will Princess Etruria.

248
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,155
Um, please help.

249
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,073
Sure.

250
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,959
Don't worry. I'll be gentle.

251
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,611
You're very wet, down there.

252
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,073
Don't say that!

253
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,134
Did it feel that good?

254
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,094
Yes.

255
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:08,636
Then...

256
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,223
Please put your manhood inside of me.

257
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,434
That is the best place to channel energy from.

258
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,477
I understand.

259
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,565
Are you okay?

260
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,858
I'm fine.

261
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,735
Do with me as you will, Sir Albion.

262
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,362
I will.

263
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,003
It's okay. Come to me.

264
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,287
I... I'm about to cum!

265
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,583
Yes! Please cum! Please fill me full of yourself!

266
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,838
I'm cumming!

267
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,730
It's all fine now.

268
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,399
Princess Etruria will return.

269
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:50,404
Albion-san, thank you. And farewell.

270
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,031
Shirera!

271
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,743
Albion...

272
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,003
Thank you, Shirera.

273
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,807
So, what was she anyway?

274
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,392
My friend.

275
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,352
Your friend?

276
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,189
She sacrificed her life to save mine.

277
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,358
She was my precious friend.

278
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,235
Your friend, huh.

279
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:32,295
In that case, I wish I could've
become friends with her too.

280
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,366
I have to admit she's not a character you could hate.

281
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,662
Well, from now on shell be with you forever. Right?

282
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,040
Right?

283
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,376
How cheesy!

284
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,835
What do you mean?

285
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,842
Did I say something funny?

286
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,846
I was trying to cheer you up.

287
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,810
Sir Albion certainly is a dense man.

288
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,521
Palmira, did you just say something?

289
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,273
Nope.

290
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,358
Nope.

291
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,694
Then that means...

292
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,740
But I'm happy. Sir Albion has found favor in me.

293
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:21,078
So I hope to serve you well, Sir Albion.

294
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,081
Sh-Shirera?

295
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,166
And so, Princess Etruria and Palmira,

296
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,335
I look forward to accompanying the two of you as well.

297
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,880
But Sir Albion is my master,

298
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,841
so I'm not letting you guys have him!

299
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,843
What was that?

300
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,680
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

301
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,516
Sir Albion is my Master!

302
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,560
I support his heart and soul.

303
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,353
What are you saying?

304
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,398
Albion belongs to me! You're number two!

305
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,735
But I too am supporting his heart and soul!

306
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,111
The past is the past.

307
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,280
He is my current Master now,

308
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,407
so I will not let anyone else have him.

309
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,994
Shirera, won't you listen to me anymore?

310
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,872
Yes. As long as you talk to me as a friend.

311
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,707
You really have got some nerve.

312
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,667
You realize this means war.

313
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,252
Bring it on.

314
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,630
Hey, girls, settle down.

315
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,548
You stay out of this!

316
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,633
Okay...

317
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,427
You've got no boobs anyway!

318
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,846
What? You perverted ghost!

319
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,014
You guys, cut it out!

320
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,808
We have to travel together. Let's try to get along.

321
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,060
Fine by me.
