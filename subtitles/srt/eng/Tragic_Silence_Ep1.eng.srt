1
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:14,825
Luticia.

2
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:17,454
What is it, Shou?

3
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:20,289
I only get to play with you at night.

4
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:21,865
It's really too bad.

5
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:26,229
I didn't mean it in a bad way!

6
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:30,070
It would be nice to see you...

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,802
smiling in the sunlight.

8
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,380
Lu.

9
00:00:46,793 --> 00:00:52,425
Tragic Silence
"Girls Play"

10
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:32,227
Should I stop?

11
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:34,036
No!

12
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:09,102
Don't stop!

13
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:10,974
You want it?

14
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:42,805
Elena...

15
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:45,069
I'm coming in.

16
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,114
Rick!

17
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:58,820
Deeper, deeper!

18
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,006
Elena, I'm coming!

19
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:57,042
Yes! Yes, Rick!

20
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,767
I'll see you again?

21
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:20,801
If I feel like it.

22
00:04:24,878 --> 00:04:25,867
Oh.

23
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:49,928
<i>Is he coming?</i>

24
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:54,972
Shou, is that you?

25
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:58,939
Did you wait?

26
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:02,474
No, I just got here myself.

27
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:05,077
Wow, have you grown again?

28
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,186
I don't know, maybe I have.

29
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,579
Of course.

30
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,017
You're growing older every day.

31
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:17,629
You really have outgrown me so quickly!

32
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:20,331
I've matured in other ways, too.

33
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:26,597
I've started working with Bob,
the village blacksmith.

34
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:28,699
The blacksmith?

35
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:32,538
I want to learn a trade...

36
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:35,906
so I can support you
wherever we choose to go.

37
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,084
I want to become independent...

38
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:42,045
so I can have you as my bride.

39
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:44,989
You want...

40
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:46,489
to marry me?

41
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:47,884
You don't?

42
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,855
His hands are warm.

43
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:53,631
But I'm...

44
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:56,759
No, we can't do that!

45
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:58,235
I can't...

46
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:01,103
live in the same world as you.

47
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:05,167
That doesn't matter, Lu.

48
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,747
You're always going to be my Lu.

49
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:09,745
So, will you accept?

50
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,045
Spring.

51
00:06:12,852 --> 00:06:15,844
No, by summer, I promise I'll be ready.

52
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:18,857
Then I'll ask you again.

53
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,450
Please think about it.

54
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:30,334
Lu.

55
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:57,757
Spring.

56
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:01,299
No, by summer, I promise I'll be ready.

57
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,903
Then I'll ask you again.

58
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,467
Please think about it.

59
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:12,038
Lu.

60
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:17,177
Shou!

61
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:20,482
Hi, Levin.

62
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:22,945
Shouldn't you be watching Bob's store?

63
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:25,651
The store.

64
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:28,492
The new guy, Marcus can handle it!

65
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:32,761
What about you?

66
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,863
You look upset, and it's your day off.

67
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:38,266
Did your girl dump you?

68
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,773
I am right.

69
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:45,808
What's so important
that you have to leave work?

70
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:48,179
Do you have to ask?

71
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:51,008
My girl. I'm going to see my girl.

72
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:53,177
So, you're still seeing her.

73
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:55,511
This is a record for you, Levin.

74
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,714
Yeah, I love her!

75
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:01,423
If I had to, I'd die for her.

76
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:02,785
Levin, you...

77
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,289
What was that for?

78
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:14,236
He isn't from around here.

79
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:15,232
Know him?

80
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,138
No, never seen him.

81
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:24,477
Elena!

82
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:29,948
Wow, what a surprise!

83
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:32,856
I thought she was
Ms. Prim and proper!

84
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,352
She's having a secret affair.

85
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,497
Levin, that's really rude.

86
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:41,734
What! I thought you didn't like her, Shou.

87
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:46,401
Last year, you turned her down
after she told you how she felt, right?

88
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,267
It's not anything against her.

89
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:52,543
I'm in love with someone else.

90
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,709
That why I couldn't.

91
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,819
And now, you've been dumped
by your girl!

92
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:00,511
Not true!

93
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:04,088
Well, Elena's apparently moved on.

94
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:07,558
You need to find somebody new.

95
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:08,890
See you!

96
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:13,060
Levin, that jerk!

97
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,478
Yes!

98
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:37,181
No, don't stop!

99
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:44,088
No!

100
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:46,156
God!

101
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:48,696
I can't take it any more.

102
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:56,269
Yes!

103
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,944
Rick!

104
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:06,081
Right now!

105
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:08,183
I want this!

106
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:17,990
Yeah.

107
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:30,240
I want...

108
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:31,710
Elena!

109
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:44,882
Deeper!

110
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:46,892
Deep inside!

111
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:49,291
I feel it!

112
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:54,219
Yes, yes!

113
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,268
This is the last time.

114
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,668
We're not fated to be together.

115
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:17,073
You couldn't bring yourself to feed on me.

116
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:20,276
What are you doing?

117
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:50,375
No!

118
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:08,192
Yes!

119
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:09,330
Levin!

120
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:45,927
Go ahead.

121
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,972
What is it?

122
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:50,741
You want me on top?

123
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:52,976
No!

124
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:36,853
Levin, Levin!

125
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:40,154
I'm coming!

126
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:41,225
Me too!

127
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:53,066
We've been together for a while.

128
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,502
That's right, I think it's been
about five years.

129
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,038
Why do you ask?

130
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:00,205
It's nothing, really.

131
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:03,709
All right.

132
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,113
I saw a strange man.

133
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:09,013
This late at night?

134
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,988
No, earlier, but he gave me the creeps.

135
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:15,020
He didn't seem human,
but he looked like one.

136
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,858
It was kind of like watching a puppet.

137
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,660
He didn't seem human.

138
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:36,006
Yes Siris, just like you.

139
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:37,910
You both give off the same vibe.

140
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:40,813
I get it now.

141
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:44,550
I guess Elena and I are in the same boat!

142
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:52,396
What's this about?

143
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,524
Look at the commotion.

144
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:03,169
Who knows, maybe there was
a burglary or something.

145
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:05,575
How boring.

146
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:06,268
Yeah.

147
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:14,651
They've killed one of us!

148
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:18,046
It's a damned villager, a young female!

149
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:21,085
They're supposed to be used
for food, not sex!

150
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:23,591
We have to take action! Get revenge!

151
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:28,365
The villagers are an important source
of food for all of us.

152
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:40,238
What's going on? Both the village
and the castle are freaking out.

153
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,614
- Because...
- A murder.

154
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:43,237
Tia!

155
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,214
A village girl killed Rick.

156
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:47,747
What, Rick?

157
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:49,549
Everyone's upset.

158
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,383
They say it's wrong to play with your food.

159
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,119
Ha, he deserved it.

160
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:56,694
He was screwing around with a lot of them.

161
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:59,862
Well, our leader doesn't share your opinion.

162
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:02,899
We've left the humans alone for a while.

163
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:05,368
Eventually, they built this big village...

164
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:08,799
and now they're claiming it
as their feeding station.

165
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:15,845
The humans are upset,
so I'd avoid going near the village.

166
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:20,975
It's not my concern.

167
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:24,185
Right, Luticia?

168
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,520
Rick was one of us.

169
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:29,355
Right?

170
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:33,155
There's no need for you to defend
Rick at all, you know.

171
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:34,998
But...

172
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,794
What do you plan on doing, Luticia?

173
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:41,168
Keep seeing him secretly? Stop feeding?

174
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:45,240
Either way, I don't feel the need
to feed anymore.

175
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,910
You're in denial, so you're
forcing yourself to be happy, no?

176
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:54,948
This situation...

177
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:58,555
means we can't live in peace
with the humans right now.

178
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:08,056
Just like that girl from the village,
we need to make a choice.

179
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:09,098
Eventually!

180
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:14,736
Shou...

181
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:19,878
Can we get more men?
We need more than this.

182
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,441
Is he coming?

183
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:55,838
Lu!

184
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:56,973
Shou!

185
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,050
Lu, I made it!

186
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,112
Are you okay?

187
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,956
I had a hard time getting around
the guards at the exit.

188
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:06,483
But I'm here!

189
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,196
You know, this could have
happened at any time.

190
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:15,598
I know. The village is enraged
by this incident.

191
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:20,599
There are people that want to
destroy your clan.

192
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:23,704
Don't worry.

193
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:26,170
I promise, I won't let that happen.

194
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:27,768
Shou...

195
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,091
Elena, was crying.

196
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,030
Crying?

197
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:47,597
She wouldn't talk at all.

198
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:52,131
I think they were both in love
with each other.

199
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:58,232
But do you think my people can live
in peace with humans?

200
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,346
You have me. Right, Lu?

201
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,714
It's not all that difficult.

202
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,015
Don't you agree?

203
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:17,819
Warmth, the warmth of his hand.

204
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,223
As long as I have him...

205
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:29,137
Lu, I have a gift.

206
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:35,177
It's my very first creation.

207
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:38,978
I had to start over several times
until I was satisfied.

208
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:42,483
I want you to have it, Lu.

209
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:47,955
This isn't about my proposal
six months ago.

210
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:51,659
Take your time.

211
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:54,491
If you decide to accept my proposal...

212
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,662
then you can wear the ring.

213
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:02,636
I'll wait an eternity for you.

214
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:06,474
I'm sorry!

215
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:08,273
I didn't mean to upset you!

216
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:16,287
We have to make a choice!

217
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:54,823
Can I?

218
00:21:58,464 --> 00:21:59,226
Luticia.

219
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:00,290
Shou.

220
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:51,483
Lu, you're getting wet.

221
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:54,278
No, stop it, don't say that!

222
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:55,375
Can I see?

223
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:58,279
I don't...

224
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:00,357
I want to know everything.

225
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:01,723
Will you?

226
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:16,806
Lu...

227
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:18,733
spread your legs.

228
00:23:27,186 --> 00:23:28,710
Lu, it's beautiful.

229
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:30,282
It's my treasure.

230
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,317
Shou...

231
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:51,671
Shou!

232
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,502
I can't.

233
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,642
Please.

234
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,441
Lu.

235
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:02,315
Lu.

236
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:08,250
Come inside me.
I want to feel you.

237
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:28,505
Lu, we're joined as one now.

238
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,379
Yes, Shou!

239
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:03,742
Shou!

240
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,047
Yes!

241
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:36,347
Yes, I'm coming!

242
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:00,164
We have a defector.

243
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:01,697
Who?

244
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:02,797
It's Siris.

245
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:05,242
She eloped with a male villager.

246
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:08,908
Damn it, with all the mess that's going on...

247
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:10,372
Siris.

248
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:15,118
We have to make a choice.

249
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:38,136
