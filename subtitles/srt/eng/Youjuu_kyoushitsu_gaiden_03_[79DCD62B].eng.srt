1
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,070
Put it on screen.

2
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,500
Situation?

3
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,110
Yes, ma'am. These floating
objects are of an unknown nature...

4
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,050
and they seem to be interfering
with our systems, somehow.

5
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,250
Life support hasn't been affected,
but Navi-Control is being disrupted.

6
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,890
Right. Understood.
Evacuating to the core shelter.

7
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,830
Level 3 emergency!
Level 3 emergency!

8
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,240
System flow! System flow!

9
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,640
O, here. I've moved to the core shelter.

10
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,680
Situation is worse than first thought.

11
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,050
Put the entire colony on Level 5 alert!

12
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,880
- Trouble!
- What's wrong?

13
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,980
A dimensional warp is forming.
Please get out of there!

14
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,090
I can't during a Level 5 alert!
Stand by and observe.

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:49,000
We can't! At this rate, the entire colony
will be sucked into the warp!

16
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,230
Hold on!

17
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,870
That voice!

18
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,280
Wander in the void between
time and space for all eternity!

19
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,340
The Demon Beast!

20
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,080
You who dared to interfere
with my resurrection...

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,090
shall be doomed to wander for all
eternity, orphans of the dimensions!

22
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,880
Now entering atmosphere.

23
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,450
Hello? Mailman.

24
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,250
Nobody's there.

25
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,020
Oh, thanks.

26
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,390
- Who is it?
- Mailman, with a special deliver.

27
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,930
Oh...

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,230
Sorry, this is a special deliver.
Can you stamp it?

29
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,970
Something wrong?

30
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,480
Oh, no. Nothing.
Let's see, the seal. The seal.

31
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,950
That's okay. You look like
you're busy at the moment.

32
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,610
Oh? Do I?

33
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,910
See you.

34
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,280
Thanks a lot.

35
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,620
- Who's it from?
- Let's see.

36
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,550
Air tickets?

37
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,920
Who could have...

38
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,610
Muneto, did you have to come so quickly?

39
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,150
Oh, uh. Sorry.

40
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,080
There's a real non-apology.

41
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,580
So, who's it from?

42
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,020
Muneto?

43
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,090
Muneto, who's the letter from?

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,490
Look, I only came over here because
you said you wanted to have some fun.

45
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,700
Am I supposed to blend into the
woodwork now that it's all over?

46
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,760
No, that's not what l...

47
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,000
Look, this is from my uncle.
It's some sort of an emergency.

48
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,070
What?

49
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,380
It looks like the Demon Beast
has appeared again.

50
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,320
My uncle saved us that other time,
and now it's my turn to return the favor.

51
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,650
But, Muneto...

52
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,750
It's okay. Don't worry.
My uncle will be there with me.

53
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,160
But we'll be apart for
a while. So, before we are...

54
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,860
Yeah?

55
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,260
Before we are, I'm gonna get
you for coming too quick!

56
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,930
OW! Kayo, cut it out! That hurts!

57
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,210
See you, Muneto. And be careful.

58
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,810
Great, I get left behind.

59
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,990
Shit! I'm gonna miss the plane!

60
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,660
I smell it.

61
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,500
I smell semen. You have the scent
of sperm on your breath.

62
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,410
Did you put it in your mouth?

63
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,850
Did you stick his dick in that
little mouth of yours and suck it?

64
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,120
I didn't do anything!

65
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,320
Now, now. You mustn't lie. I can
smell it from your lovely little mouth.

66
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,190
Stop it! Let me go!

67
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,400
If you struggle,
I'll spread the word.

68
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,210
About you and the smell
of sperm on your breath!

69
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,540
If you don't want me to tell...

70
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,210
then you'd better whisper
exactly what you did into my ear.

71
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,780
But... But, l...

72
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,720
Ah, and you have the smell of semen
on the nape of your neck as well.

73
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,490
All right. I took Muneto's...

74
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,190
Muneto's what?

75
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,200
Muneto's... and sucked it.

76
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,830
Good girl. I want to check out
a few other parts now as well.

77
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,230
I imagine you smell like
sperm down THERE as well!

78
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,240
MUNETO!

79
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,980
Shit! I'll never make it!

80
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,250
Uncle? When did you get here?

81
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,760
Muneto, why are you racing around?

82
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,800
Good timing! I'm going away
for a little while.

83
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,490
Can you watch the place for me?

84
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,930
- Where are you going?
- Hokkaido!

85
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,600
North. This bodes ill.

86
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,480
I don't want Kayo to think
I'm cheating on her.

87
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,180
It wasn't true that
my uncle wrote to me.

88
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,850
But I couldn't tell her that
it came from Miyuki!

89
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,290
And besides that, how she invited
me up to visit her in Hokkaido.

90
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,220
It might have been better
if she'd invited Kayo, too...

91
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,200
considering they're cousins.

92
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,830
But then, Miyuki and I
share that strange...

93
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,630
karmic link to each other
from our past lives.

94
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,580
So, you're Muneto, huh?
Hmm, not bad at all.

95
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,480
You landed a nice one, Kayo.

96
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,380
I didn't tell Kayo.

97
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,780
I feel like this isn't the
first time we've met.

98
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,650
So, I... I...

99
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,550
Please!

100
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,590
Miyuki, don't! Kayo and I are...

101
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,320
Have you forgotten me?

102
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,830
Even a thousand years apart
hasn't lessened my love for you.

103
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,030
Your Yukino still burns
for you, body and soul.

104
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,230
Sohnen, my love!

105
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,170
Miyuki, I'm not Sohnen!
I'm Muneto Ungyosai!

106
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,410
Don't say such things to me.

107
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,070
Have you forgotten the warmth of my skin
I promised to you a thousand years ago?

108
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,180
- Stop it Miyuki! SOH!
- You mustn't, Yukino!

109
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,010
Sohnen, my love...

110
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,430
You mustn't... You mustn't... No woman
may enter the sacred grounds of Oyama.

111
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,560
I must remain celibate for my training!

112
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,500
No... No... Love me... Love me!

113
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,470
As hard as you can!

114
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,370
Give me a passion that will
burn for a thousand years!

115
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,110
Yu... Yukino!

116
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,330
Sohnen, my love!

117
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,710
Yukino!

118
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,420
Oh, shit!

119
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,450
Karma.

120
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,480
The karmic debt of Yukino's love
for Sohnen a thousand years ago.

121
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,320
But, Miyuki and I are...

122
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,960
Ladies and gentlemen, we've begun
our decent into Furano Airport.

123
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,800
The captain has now turned on
the fasten seat belts sign.

124
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,000
I wonder how she is?

125
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:26,010
Okay. Huh?
It's in the mountains? Great.

126
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,450
Lord Muneto!

127
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,180
I've come for you, sir!

128
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,480
Huh?

129
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,760
Lord Muneto Ungyosai?

130
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,960
Yeah?

131
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,560
The Lady Miyuki sent me
to get you, my lord.

132
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,430
The LADY Miyuki?

133
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,310
Huh?

134
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,170
She's a priestess?

135
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,680
Yes.

136
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,210
Miyuki really. I never thought
she was into that.

137
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,220
Our Great Leader. No, the Lady Miyuki,
I mean, possesses fantastic power.

138
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,980
Fantastic power?

139
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,590
Yes. She's given us a new life.

140
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,130
A new life, huh?

141
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,290
Yes. With the father
of the black forest...

142
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,630
who is pregnant with the
seed of a thousand beasts.

143
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,970
The Great Savior of all creation
granted her this power.

144
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,740
When the Lady Miyuki
grants you her affection...

145
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,830
you will understand her power.

146
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,310
Uh, anyway, how much further?

147
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,210
About four hours.

148
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,050
Fo... FOUR HOURS? It's that far?

149
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,990
At this rate, we should be
there by daybreak.

150
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,580
Wow, it sure is cold here.

151
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,890
It is. 20 degrees below freezing.

152
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,730
Yow! I heard it got cold here, but...

153
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,140
This won't do at all.
Let's get a bit warmer.

154
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,890
Oh, it's morning.

155
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,890
We should see the palace soon.

156
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,660
We are two hours behind
schedule, though.

157
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,160
Oh, there you go again.

158
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,140
Well, I'm still young.

159
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,070
Look, you can see it now.

160
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,810
It's like something
from another world.

161
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,840
The Great Savior used his power
to create heaven on earth.

162
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,850
What's that disc?

163
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,180
It gives this place the power of life.

164
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,990
Allowing green fields to bloom
in the midst of winter.

165
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,150
Wow, pretty impressive power.

166
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,830
Wait a sec, you said Miyuki
started this sect?

167
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,890
Yes. Lady Miyuki is the sole incarnation of
the Great Savior's power upon this world.

168
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,270
I'm getting nervous
about meeting her.

169
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,770
Holy...

170
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,610
And it's the middle of winter.

171
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,950
Lord Muneto...

172
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,860
shall we go to Lady Miyuki now?
Come here, please.

173
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,750
What, on this?

174
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,620
Yes. Let's go.

175
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,490
Whoa!

176
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,970
Hang onto me.
We'll be at the shrine soon.

177
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,800
Lord Muneto has arrived.

178
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,970
Go in.

179
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,380
If you see a girl you like, we could
have her brought to your chambers.

180
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,580
Thanks, but...

181
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,320
Hi!

182
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,660
Muneto, welcome!

183
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,160
Huh? Miyuki?

184
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,430
I've been so looking forward
to seeing you again.

185
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,230
You look like a goddess.
I almost didn't recognize you.

186
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,800
Thank you.

187
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,710
- Now then, why don't you sleep till dusk?
- Sure.

188
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,340
The sect is having a feast tonight.
I'm glad you were able to make it.

189
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,650
Though you seem to have done
a few dark deeds on the way here.

190
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,620
No matter. We'll purify you.

191
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,750
Purify me?

192
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,690
Yes. I called you out here to save you
from when the earth is destroyed.

193
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,030
When the earth is destroyed?

194
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,830
Come, show Muneto where to go.

195
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,270
This way, please.

196
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,560
Sure.

197
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,970
Rest until nightfall.

198
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,340
Thank you for all your trouble.

199
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,310
Have no fear, you will be justly rewarded.

200
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,680
As will you.

201
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,580
My lady!

202
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,360
I told you to bring Muneto here,
not to do with him as you wished.

203
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,400
Forgive me.

204
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,260
Lord Muneto was cold,
so I thought I'd warm him.

205
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,200
Enough excuses.
You will get your reward.

206
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,040
Although I may have to teach
you to choose with more care.

207
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,670
Come. Don't you want it?

208
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,870
I do!

209
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,740
Grant me your power, Lady Miyuki!

210
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,320
I beg you. Grant it to me.

211
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,760
Oh, thank you!

212
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,790
There, all set.

213
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,730
- Now clean me.
- Yes, my lady.

214
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,810
Now it's your turn.

215
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,170
- Do as you like with her!
- Yes!

216
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:02,050
Ah, the smell! The smell!
The smell of a bitch in heat!

217
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,450
The smell of a bitch in heat!

218
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,260
And now we can prepare for
the feast without any regrets.

219
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,290
Miyuki?

220
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,350
Good morning.
Time to rise and shine.

221
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,760
What are...

222
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,860
Purifying you.

223
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,230
I'm going to cleanse you
of the filth of the lower world.

224
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,500
But...

225
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,830
Just forget about everthing else and let
the two of us have fun with each other.

226
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,850
Don't move.
I'll do all the work for you.

227
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,120
This is Soma,
the holy fruit of our sect.

228
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,310
Soma?

229
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,820
Yes. The juice of this fruit will heighten
the passion between two people.

230
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,320
How exactly?

231
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,890
It'll take effect soon.

232
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,920
Oh, yes!

233
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,700
I can't take it!

234
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,640
Ready? Will you come into me?

235
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,940
I can't wait anymore.

236
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,620
Yes! Oh, yes!

237
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,590
Muneto! Muneto! Fill me!

238
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,860
Fill me up inside!

239
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,700
It's incredible! So warm!

240
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:11,470
I feel it! I feel you thrusting
into me, filling me!

241
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,830
More! Oh, God!

242
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,570
I'm going to come!
I'm going to come!

243
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,380
With me! With me!
Come with me, please!

244
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,050
Yes! Yes!

245
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,330
Muneto...

246
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,280
Don't stop! Here! Here! Here!

247
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,180
And don't you guys slack off, either!

248
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,180
MUNETO!!!

249
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,910
Outta the way!

250
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,710
I could've sworn I just heard Kayo.

251
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,080
Listen to me, all of you!

252
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,920
We now begin the holy feast
in honor of the Great Savior!

253
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,720
This foul world will
soon be destroyed.

254
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:36,100
We alone, the worshippers of
the Great Savior, shall be spared.

255
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,560
We must lift up our voices
in joy to the Great Savior!

256
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,300
We have brought his Holy Mother
to guide him here to us!

257
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,240
Bring the Holy Mother forth!

258
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,140
No! No!

259
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,020
Let me go!

260
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,920
Kayo? What's she doing here?

261
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,820
No! Stop it!

262
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,000
Miyuki! Help me, please!

263
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm afraid you misunderstand.

264
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,170
You have to bring our
Great Savior here to us!

265
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,540
Miyuki! Miyuki, come to your senses!

266
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,270
It's me, Kayo! Your cousin!

267
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,010
I'm not this "Holy Mother!"

268
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:30,620
The Great Savior will soon
manifest from that golden orb.

269
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,680
And then he will surely
seek the Holy Mother.

270
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,290
He so longs to return
to his beloved home.

271
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,520
No! Stop it!

272
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,360
Miyuki, please!

273
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,210
What are you doing?

274
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,250
Stop it.

275
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,350
A sign for the gods
from the blessed Holy Mother!

276
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,130
Stop it! I'm so ashamed!

277
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,970
Prepare! For the Ceremony
of Ultimate Bliss!

278
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,560
No! No! MUNETO!!!

279
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,970
Dammit!

280
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,410
Kayo!

281
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,280
Miyuki?

282
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,480
We'll lead him here together.
The Great Savior.

283
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,080
What... What are you saying?

284
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,420
Here's something nice to rub on it.

285
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,690
How long can you resist?

286
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,130
Stop it, please.

287
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,880
Kayo.

288
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,820
My, see how it drips?

289
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,730
These love juices.

290
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,300
Stop it.

291
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,610
Oh, yes! The Blessed Love
juices for the Great Savior!

292
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,110
Now that I've smeared you with the
holy fruit, the flow will never stop.

293
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,520
No. Stop it. Please!

294
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,780
Oh? Not enough for you?

295
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,950
What if I were to stuff
ALL of this inside of you?

296
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,360
Stop it. Please, stop it.

297
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,900
STOP IT!

298
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,260
STOP!

299
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,500
Somebody out there?

300
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,240
No. Must've been our imagination.

301
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,970
Well, then get back in here.

302
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,210
Right. Time to punish you, little missy!

303
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,350
Muneto, now would not be
a good time to start yelling!

304
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,120
You know my name. Who are you?

305
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,960
Captain O. Interplanetar
Mutual Observation Agency.

306
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,270
You're who?

307
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,790
"To be continued..."
