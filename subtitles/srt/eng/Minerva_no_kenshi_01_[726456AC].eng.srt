1
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,740
Sho! Sho! Be careful, Sho!

2
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,270
Don't worry, Diana!

3
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,740
That's a beautiful knife!

4
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,850
Isn't it? I found it in my father's room.

5
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,190
What's going on, Randis?

6
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,230
Can't you tell, your Highness?

7
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,990
I see you do not agree
with my leadership.

8
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,100
When you promoted me to palace guard,
I did not take the position...

9
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,500
only for your sake.

10
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,900
I'm following in the footsteps you
took five years ago, your Highness!

11
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,350
Dee, will you become
my servant someday?

12
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,620
What? I want to be a princess.
I'm not going to be a servant!

13
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,060
My father always says to make
servants of your most valuable people.

14
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,690
No! I'm going to
become a princess!

15
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,160
I can't be killed now.

16
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,290
Prince, I must take your life.

17
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,980
I was not supposed to take this?

18
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,180
No! It's not his fault!
I asked him to get the fruit!

19
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,390
Sho, he is serious.
Get away! Hurry!

20
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,160
Get away? No one gets killed
just for taking some fruit.

21
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,370
Just go!

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,430
Prepare to die!

23
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,170
Sho!

24
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,210
No! Sho, get away!

25
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,090
Get away!
Sho!!

26
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,500
Sho!!!!

27
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,160
Sho!!!!

28
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,550
Ms. Diana

29
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,390
Are you alright? You sounded
very disturbed in your sleep.

30
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,080
It's nothing. I'm fine.
Leave me alone.

31
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,690
I'm going to get dressed.

32
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,990
I'll go get...

33
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,460
Just leave me alone!

34
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:59,020
In the blue moonlight, I close my eyes.

35
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:13,400
to hear the voice from above

36
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:32,490
In my dream, I say my prayers

37
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:46,000
Wishing my faith will
reach and protect you

38
00:05:47,440 --> 00:06:04,780
A figure in the wind

39
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,870
Is Diana still asleep?

40
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,540
She is getting dressed now.

41
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,110
I see. Well she'd
better dress beautifully.

42
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,690
If this marriage arrangement
with Prince Dunan works out...

43
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,350
our relationship with Gupta
will become even stronger.

44
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,270
Some father, using your own
daughter to secure your position.

45
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,470
Better than those who sell
their daughters at the bazaar.

46
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,000
He is prince of
the most powerful nation.

47
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,440
What is the difference?

48
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,650
That's a poor attitude, Hilda.
If you want, I can sell you...

49
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,350
at the bazaar as well.

50
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,150
Keep a watch on Diana
and don't let her escape.

51
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,420
Sire!

52
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,820
You cannot even trust
your own daughter.

53
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,690
Hey mister! How about this?

54
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,730
Hey, hey! This woman was
serving a certain noble family!

55
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,740
Look at this beautiful body!

56
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,700
Not only good manners,
she is great in bed as well.

57
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,460
Hey young man, you're not
planning to buy a servant, are you?

58
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,600
You're too young for that.

59
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,480
Go to a nearby town
and steal one, why don’t you?

60
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,540
Good for you.

61
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,180
60 Krest!

62
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,650
80!

63
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,750
Any other offers?

64
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,820
85, I say 85!

65
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,190
How about 100!

66
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,190
100, 100 Krest!
Alright, she is all yours, mister!

67
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,530
Take her, you lucky son of a gun!

68
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,210
The next one is a virgin!

69
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,170
Train her any way you like!

70
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,880
Stand up straight
and show your body.

71
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:23,720
She is a rare buy!
Very nubile and healthy!

72
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,090
Look at her teeth,
and this smooth tongue!

73
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,070
Starting from 40 Krest!

74
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,430
50!

75
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,900
I'll pay 60!

76
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,500
How about 70!

77
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,630
70, 70 Krest!!

78
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,400
Stop it! She doesn't deserve
that sort of treatment!

79
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,870
There's no need to be so cruel.

80
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,080
Hey pal, are you going to buy her?

81
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,190
I've no need to pay for a servant.

82
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,810
If you're not
going to buy, shove off!

83
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,720
I have a permit from the
royal family to run this auction.

84
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,900
It's perfectly legal.

85
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,090
Keep your hands off me!

86
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,060
What!

87
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,640
Not bad!

88
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,340
You little prick! Get him!

89
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,500
Punk! You're not even worth
drawing my sword.

90
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,100
Punk!

91
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,190
Hey! Quarrels at the
bazaar are forbidden!

92
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,290
You are pretty good. Hey?!

93
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,020
I need to borrow this!

94
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,830
Hey! I said, "snatch a woman,"
not my horse!

95
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,540
Get back here! Thief!

96
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,260
Well, what're we
going to do now?

97
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,170
The field dragons will come out,
once the sun sets.

98
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
I'm so sorry.
It's all because of me.

99
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,270
Don't worry about it.
They made me angry.

100
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,540
So what's your name?

101
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,640
You can call me Fina.

102
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,780
I'm Diana.

103
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,680
Diana, it's a rather feminine name.

104
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,520
Don't you townsfolk know anything?

105
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,690
They are called water lizards.
Savage carnivores.

106
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,730
As you saw, you'd be
reduced to bones in seconds.

107
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,940
Careless people like you
should stay inside the town.

108
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,910
We'll teach you a lesson or two.
You can pay us with that woman.

109
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,650
Good idea.

110
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,310
You scum!

111
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,950
Think you are big enough?

112
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,420
Stupid punk! We saved your
lives from the water lizards.

113
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,050
Now leave us that woman and beat it.

114
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,620
Not a chance!
Fina!!

115
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,190
Trying to escape?

116
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,830
That's it, run!

117
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,930
Run, you punks!

118
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Hey, look at them go!

119
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,780
Go, go, go!

120
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,690
How spirited.

121
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,820
Damn you!
I'll cut the life out of you!

122
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,730
Damn!

123
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,330
Get away, Fina! Go! Go!

124
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,260
Diana!

125
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,170
Fina!

126
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,140
Gilman, stop playing around!
Let's go screw her.

127
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,940
I suppose so.

128
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,010
Shit!

129
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,840
What a surprise!
This one's female, too!

130
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,510
Yeah? Good deal.

131
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,470
Diana! Let go! Let go of me!

132
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,990
Get your hands off!

133
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,790
Diana!!

134
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,960
We lucked out.
Two fresh females.

135
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,060
They say "The Roc bird
carries an egg,".

136
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,760
Should we take them now?

137
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,130
After showing them to the Chief.

138
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,800
Got it.

139
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,490
I must apologize for
Diana's sudden illness.

140
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,560
It seems she's
anxious about your visit.

141
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,440
She's been very difficult
these days, but it will pass.

142
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,130
However I would like to say...

143
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,170
you truly are a great prince.
I'm glad the King of Gupta...

144
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,940
could grant my ever humble request.

145
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,220
No, no. Me, I am just
an encumbrance, a second son.

146
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,590
Without this marriage,
I am useless to my father.

147
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,320
I am grateful to him,
for raising me to maturity...

148
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,530
and to you as well for giving me
this opportunity for marriage.

149
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,760
My only regret is that
I will not get to meet your...

150
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,930
beautiful daughter in person.

151
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,560
It will only be a few days.

152
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,770
For the time being,
please take my finest servant.

153
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,040
By the way...

154
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,710
what does your father
plan to do about the nomads?

155
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,720
Nothing special, I presume,
he will keep our trade...

156
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,850
relationship cordial as
it's been in the past.

157
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,880
Why do you ask?

158
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,220
Have you heard of the
"legendary hero'?

159
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,670
Legendary hero?
You mean the man they call...

160
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,640
"the Wind-Sent Hero"?

161
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,170
A pagan belief of the nomads...

162
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,610
of one man binding hundreds
of thousands of nomads together.

163
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,610
It's impossible.

164
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,610
Nevertheless, I've heard this
legendary hero will abolish...

165
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,680
the Imperial rule
and rebuild a civil nation.

166
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,920
King Randis, you don't actually
take this rumor seriously?

167
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,930
Is Diana still missing!?

168
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,660
She's out of the palace by now.
It'll be difficult finding her.

169
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:58,010
Only a few of us guards even
knows what she looks like.

170
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,340
It's possible that she's
outside of Doria by now.

171
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,510
What!!

172
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,090
If that is the case,
there is a concern.

173
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,720
What is it?

174
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,420
There have been reports that
our patrol guards have spotted...

175
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,760
nomad carriages outside of Doria.

176
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,670
You've finally awakened.

177
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,110
Welcome to the carriage
of the nomads' slaves.

178
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,280
Untie me now!

179
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,550
And who do you think you are?

180
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,220
l, I am the Princess Diana of Doria.

181
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,960
Did you hear that?
The Princess of Doria, she says.

182
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,370
The Princess disguised herself
as a man and then went outgo fight?

183
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,730
That's good.

184
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,370
And stark naked on top of that.

185
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,440
It's too late for embarrassment now.
We saw every nook and cranny of...

186
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,910
your body while you were out.

187
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,470
Princess or not,
it does not matter anymore.

188
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,420
You are now a slave,
just like the rest of us.

189
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,650
And a newcomer at that!

190
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,420
You are now in the same class
as your tender friend.

191
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,830
Fina... Where is Fina?

192
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,930
Fina, your friend is looking for you.

193
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,400
It's so... Fina.

194
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,230
It's happening...
It's happening again!

195
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,780
I'll stop if you like.

196
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,710
No, don't stop!
Please... please!

197
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,450
I beg you, master... please!

198
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,810
What did you do to her?

199
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,420
We're training her, so her
master won't tire of her and...

200
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,450
feed her to a field dragon.

201
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:01,730
Look, she's ready.
Watch well, for you are next.

202
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,960
Yes, watch well and learn.

203
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,140
No!! I won't watch!!

204
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,200
If you want to be disobedient,
we can throw your Fina...

205
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,370
outside of camp this instant.

206
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,340
So, so cruel.

207
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,040
Until you are officially assigned
to a master tonight...

208
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,550
you're at my complete disposal.

209
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,540
Well, what shall it be?

210
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,320
I will watch.
Just don’t torture her.

211
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,700
Again... again!

212
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,080
Yes... yes... yes!

213
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:54,350
Fina's... Fina's!

214
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,380
Well, seems the "princess'
is just about ready herself.

215
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,940
So, how do you feel?

216
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,520
That hurts!!

217
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,080
Answer with master
when you are spoken to!!

218
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,660
Y, yes.

219
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,520
Well then,
are you aroused?

220
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,030
l, I don't know.

221
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,090
You're a
troublesome princess.

222
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,300
Come now, Princess.
Play nice, or you know...

223
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,530
what'll happen to Fina?

224
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,290
Such a beautiful body.

225
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,670
That good?

226
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,740
I don't know.
I really don't.

227
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,140
Oh yes you do.

228
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,210
Your body is aching for
a master to come inside.

229
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,680
Don't... Don't say that.
I'm embarrassed.

230
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,320
Why don't we finish her off?

231
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,460
We'll have fun training you.

232
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,310
Now tell us, "Please play with me.
Please give it to me, Master".

233
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,340
I... I can't.

234
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,400
No!

235
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,070
Hurry. Say it.
Give it up.

236
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,350
Play with me... more.

237
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,350
What was that? I can't hear you.

238
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,660
Say it louder.

239
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,600
Yes!

240
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,860
Master!!

241
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:46,320
Diana isn't ill but missing.
Isn't that right?

242
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,260
The King can’t teach his daughter to
behave, though he did very well...

243
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,430
with her servant.

244
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,540
Until the Princess returns,
I suppose we'll have a good time.

245
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,560
Take this!

246
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,170
Now! Tell us! Who are you?

247
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:44,750
Diana... daughter of
King Randis of Doria...

248
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,310
Still haven't learned!

249
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,890
Beautiful whip, works like a charm.

250
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,100
She's in pain,
and yet still so very aroused.

251
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,520
Come, let's see.

252
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,440
Come now, why don't you give up
and tell us you want to be ours.

253
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,410
We'll take you to a place
you've never been.

254
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,810
Feels so good... can't even talk.

255
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,530
That's enough for now.
Put the collar round her neck.

256
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,630
No!! Don't!! No!!

257
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,670
Shut up!

258
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,830
Alright, who wants her?

259
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,370
Stand up all those
who want to own her!

260
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,990
All of you, huh? Alright, alright.

261
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,490
As usual Chief,
it's up to you to decide.

262
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,350
I don't get to have her?

263
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,730
You, too?!

264
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,490
Why not? It's been a while
since I've had one this good.

265
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,500
You and your appetite.
Alright then, we take turns!

266
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,740
Halt!

267
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,040
I'm looking for
lodging for the night.

268
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,050
No problem.

269
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,010
Welcome to our camp.

270
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,450
What's going on?

271
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,190
Just a little fun.

272
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,630
I don’t fight without a reason.

273
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,800
Is that a weapon you sport,
or just a pretty decoration?

274
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,700
Got butterflies?

275
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,140
Hey, coward.
Can't draw your sword?

276
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,910
You won't come out of this alive.

277
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,310
You finally found some guts!

278
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,740
You!

279
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,020
I suppose I can forget
about the lodging.

280
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,880
He'll tangle with me this time.

281
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,920
Chief!

282
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,190
I've spoken!

283
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,890
Chief!!

284
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,010
Why didn’t you kill me?

285
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,070
I have no reason.

286
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,110
The insult to me has
been paid for with his life.

287
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,430
Let us apologize properly.
Put your sword away.

288
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,000
My name is Teo, chief of this tribe.

289
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,810
And you?

290
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,610
Sho...

291
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,750
Sho... My name is Sho.

292
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,850
Sho...

293
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,990
Excuse me for not
taking my mask off.

294
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,930
It's no matter.

295
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,130
This is the "oath of heroes, '
passed along by us...

296
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,900
"The Children of the Wind'.

297
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,060
This is a token of
ever-lasting friendship.

298
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,330
And we'll give
you the woman too.

299
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,450
No objections, fellows?

300
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,910
Take her.

301
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,890
I am on a journey,
I can't keep companions...

302
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,790
She claims to be
Princess Diana of Doria.

303
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,560
Don't be shy. Take her!

304
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:11,600
We'll have a celebration!
Let's drink with Sho till sunrise!

305
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,150
You look very good.

306
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,290
Diana, you're so beautiful.

307
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,730
Take that sad look off your face.

308
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,090
Come now, your Master
will get turned off.

309
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:50,950
Sho, is that you?
If you're really my Sho, I'll...

310
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,270
Aren’t you going to enjoy me?

311
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,410
Am I so ugly?

312
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,020
No, you are beautiful.

313
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,970
I never thought I could do
things such as this.

314
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,610
Enough, Dee!

315
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,220
You are mine Sho.

316
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:11,860
Master. Please accept me
as your humble slave.

317
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,660
I would serve you till the end
of my life if it will sooth your pain.

318
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,500
I would endure
any humiliation, any pain.

319
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,900
Master please, do what you like.

320
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,870
Stop it, Diana.

321
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,920
My name is not Diana.

322
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:35,380
If I was your Diana, then I would
have to kill the man who...

323
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:42,050
is my father's foe,
even if it costs my life.

324
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,120
Why? I want to be a princess!
Not a servant!

325
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,730
I want to be a princess!

326
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,960
I want to be a princess!

327
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,740
My name is not Diana.

328
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,740
Are you really content
as you are now?

329
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,970
Yes.

330
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,610
I see.

331
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,510
Thank you, Master.

332
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:13,980
I will serve you to the end.
Until I am no more.

333
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,280
I have to give you a name.

334
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,960
How about "Dee"?

335
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,390
Yes, it's a nice name.

336
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,890
Dee!

337
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,330
Sho, my Master...

338
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,310
Sho!

339
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,360
It's embarrassing!

340
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,460
N... no, No!!

341
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,070
Dee, don't you like it?

342
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,510
No... I'm, a lowly slave.

343
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,790
How do you like it, Dee?

344
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,190
I don't know.
Please do whatever you like.

345
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:06,670
Master... yes... more!
Please use me as you like!

346
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,670
How am l, Master?

347
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,440
Dee, don't worry.

348
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,590
No!

349
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,450
Do you want me to stop?

350
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,720
No, don't stop! Sho, please!

351
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,060
Dee!

352
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,360
Master... Yes!

353
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,300
Dee!

354
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,500
I'm close... yes!

355
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,810
Can't hold it any longer!

356
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,820
Master, I'm so sorry
for not waking before you.

357
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,780
Please... forgive me!

358
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,090
Dee...

359
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,620
You are forgiven just this time.

360
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,630
Yes, Master.

361
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,370
That hurts!

362
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,570
Hurry up!
We'll miss breakfast.

363
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,440
Yes, sir!

364
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,480
Hey, Sho!!

365
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,310
Sorry I'm late.

366
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,350
No worries.

367
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,380
The day starts with
a full breakfast.

368
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,960
It's a custom among
nomads to eat plenty.

369
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,000
Impressive! One night and
she's completely broken.

370
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:25,340
And she was so gutsy.
What do you say, guys?

371
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,110
You!

372
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,120
Y... yes.

373
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,690
Are you happy being his slave?

374
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,690
Yes, sir!!

375
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:44,060
Well, not only in swordsmanship,
but he beat me in training...

376
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,290
a slave as well.

377
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,800
I owe you, Chief. Thank you.

378
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,430
Thank you for providing me
with such a great slave.

379
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,370
Don't mention it.

380
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,170
I can't believe it's
only been one night.

381
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,350
So, what does he call you?

382
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,940
He named me Dee.

383
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,680
Dee, now that's a good name.
Did he enjoy you last night?

384
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,820
Yes, till his heart's content.

385
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,100
I have to take your life, Prince!

386
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,010
Prepare to die!

387
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,080
Sho!

388
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,900
Get away!

389
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,030
Sho!

390
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,310
Isn't it? I found it in
my father's room.

391
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,180
Dee, you are going to become
my servant when you're older.

392
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,320
Why? I want to be a princess.
I'm not going to be a servant!

393
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,890
My father tells me, make servants
of your most valuable people.

394
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,410
No! I'm going to be a princess!

395
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,000
What is it?

396
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,380
I was wondering, where
you're headed, Sho of Doria?

397
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,920
What!?

398
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,750
I don't want to repeat
last night's mistake.

399
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,850
Sho of Doria, and Princess Diana.

400
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,550
How did you know?

401
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,020
That crest is rather unique.

402
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,500
Don't get so worked up.
You're scaring the horse.

403
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,130
If I was going to sell
you to the King of Doria...

404
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,610
I would've arranged
it while you were...

405
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,410
in each others' arms last night.

406
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,910
Then... last night, you were?

407
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:53,180
No, we didn't
mean to eavesdrop.

408
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,080
Then how?

409
00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:00,750
Well... you were so loud,
we just overheard, despite ourselves.

410
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,230
That's my fault. However, you didn't
come after us just to tell us that.

411
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,190
I once made a pact with Bassen.

412
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,530
You knew my father?

413
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,330
Yes.

414
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,530
Take this.

415
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,050
This cannot be?

416
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,750
The crest of
the Children of the Wind...

417
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,960
binding the twelve
clans of the grasslands.

418
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
This crest is proof
of the Chief's status.

419
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:07,850
Sho, you took an oath
of heroes with a great man.

420
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,840
Sho, take this, won't you?

421
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,210
Yes... I'm honored. However...

422
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,750
However?

423
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,170
I am not a child of the wind.

424
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:35,150
The Chief of your people
must be a Wind-Sent.

425
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,650
When my wish is fulfilled,
I will return this crest to you.

426
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,020
Agreed?

427
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,460
Agreed.

428
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,930
So long as you have a just cause,
a hundred thousand cavalry from...

429
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,930
twelve clans will die for you.

430
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:43,020
In a pair of yearning eyes,
I fall into a dream...

431
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:56,430
and again the hard
wind blows in.

432
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:13,210
Turning back the long
way I have come.

433
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:26,630
The shadows of flowers
are swaying in the wind.

434
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:48,220
In the sky, a bird cries out.

435
00:43:51,960 --> 00:44:12,140
Although the pain in my
heart brings me down...

436
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:17,670
with you...

437
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:28,330
someday...

438
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:34,030
someday...

439
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:53,180
I hope our fates will
meet on top of the hill.
