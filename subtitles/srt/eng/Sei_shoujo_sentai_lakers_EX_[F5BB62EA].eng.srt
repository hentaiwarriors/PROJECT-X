Ripped By Hanako

15
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,650
In ancient times, the peaceful planet
of Blade Star was destroyed by

16
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,390
the evil Imperial Empire of Godram.

17
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,660
Although most of the inhabitants were
massacred, some of the Bladdians

18
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,170
fled the invasion, coming to Earth
with their secret energy source,

19
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,030
the "Super-Laker Crystals."

20
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:57,710
Today, the Bladdian descendants rise
to defend the Earth from it's foes.

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:06,520
Today, they are known as Star Laker,
Kung Fu Laker, Judo Laker,

22
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,650
Soul Laker, and Bunny Laker.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,330
Led by Blade Knight, who commands
the "Ultra-Space-Time-Battleship,"

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,370
the defenders transform into the Lakers
with the help of the Laker Crystals.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,240
In their effort to protect the Earth
against the invading evil Godram empire,

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:33,610
the Lakers don
their special Laker battle suits.

27
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,480
What happened to the lights?

28
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,450
Sorry! Sorry!

29
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,550
I 'm so sorry. I think the power cord
must have come out.

30
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:28,260
I 've had it! Chiaki and Yayoi
are causing trouble again!

31
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,030
That's why retards shouldn't be allowed
to touch any mechanical equipment.

32
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,270
Hey, I 'm apologizing.

33
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,140
How can you say something like that?

34
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,740
Chiaki, don't get so upset.

35
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,540
Couldn't you at least get miffed
on my behalf?

36
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,780
I 'm the one who is always getting
inconvenienced by all these retakes.

37
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,320
They're driving me up a wall!

38
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,550
Natsune, you too?

39
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,280
Don't cop such a nasty attitude.

40
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,550
It's Chiaki who's being nasty.

41
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,030
Do you really want to mess with me?

42
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,030
Chiaki, cool it!

43
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,400
That's fine... Come on!

44
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,300
Oh, Natsune.

45
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,900
Both of you, give it a rest!

46
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,670
Chiaki!

47
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,370
Natsune!

48
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,880
Drop dead, you moron.

49
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,710
Drop dead yourself, you clown.

50
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,650
Both of you... that's enough!

51
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,150
Are you okay?

52
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,450
Hey, Akira, get yourself together.

53
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,030
Ouch! It hurts!

54
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,430
Enough! The two of you, cut it out!

55
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,460
Tomorrow is the school festival,
and we only have today left to practice.

56
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,730
Don't you feel badly for Reiko?

57
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,070
She's willing to perform
without even getting paid?

58
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,900
I didn't do anything wrong!

59
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,070
There... there...

60
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,480
Be a good girl and don't cry.

61
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,550
I 'm sorry Chiaki.

62
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,710
I just got a little upset.

63
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,450
Me, too.

64
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,450
I 'll behave better next time.

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,120
Reiko,
I 'm so sorry about all of this.

66
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,220
Don't worry about it.

67
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,990
I 'm singing because I truly enjoy it.

68
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,690
Okay then. One more time.

69
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,750
Reiko are you ready?

70
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,250
Sure.

71
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,230
Okay then, from the top... Go.

72
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,820
Great, Reiko, it's perfect.

73
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,460
Lakers, you shall amuse me.

74
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,570
See you. Okay, I 'm going this way.

75
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,470
Okay. Let's do our best tomorrow.

76
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,770
Yup, good night.

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,710
Reiko, hold on...

78
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,140
What's that?

79
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,310
I have something important
to talk to you about.

80
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,780
Can I walk you home?

81
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,050
What is it?

82
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,110
You're in show-business,
and it's so hard to talk with you.

83
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,320
If I don't speak with you now,
I don't know when I 'll get the chance.

84
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,190
Okay.

85
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,690
Okay, everyone...

86
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,660
Please be careful on your way home.

87
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,300
I envy Reiko.

88
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,270
Akira...

89
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,000
Rats!

90
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,740
Experiment?

91
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,580
Yes. I have an idea on how to more
effectively power-up the Laker suits.

92
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,120
Can you help me?

93
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,280
Does it have to be tonight?
Tomorrow is the show.

94
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,850
The day an idea comes into your mind
is the best day to act on it.

95
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,590
Don't you know that? Come on,
transform into Star Laker... Quickly!

96
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,390
You're so pushy!

97
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,530
Star Laker, crystal conversion.

98
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,180
Good! Now we can start the experiment.

99
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,010
What's that?

100
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,090
With the most-popular singer
as my rival... I have no hope!

101
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,420
Home at last.

102
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,470
Oh Chiaki, you're so late.

103
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,500
Welcome home.

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,970
A-A-Akira?

105
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,940
You are so late, Chiaki.

106
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,340
I 've been waiting so long for you.

107
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,280
What are you doing here?

108
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,340
I thought you went to Reiko's.

109
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,580
Well,
I just had a sudden urge to see you.

110
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,290
Come on, what are you talking about?

111
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,710
Huh... I see. It's a grudge.

112
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,890
You're teasing me
because I belted you this afternoon.

113
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,590
Unfortunately,
I 'm not so easily deceived.

114
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,430
Don't you know my real feelings?

115
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,160
But you like Reiko...

116
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:10,140
Well, I now know in my heart
that it's you I really love.

117
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,610
Are you joking?

118
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,550
I will prove it to you... Now!

119
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,390
What has happened to you
all of the sudden, Akira?

120
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,330
Natsune, I like you.

121
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,410
Please stop toying with me, Akira.

122
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,510
Yayoi, I 'm serious.

123
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,690
Akira, it's okay with me,
but what about Reiko?

124
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,200
Don't tell me about her.

125
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,360
Yuka, you've always been my type.

126
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,620
As you know,
Laker suits increase in power

127
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,690
in direct proportion to the energy level
of the person wearing the suit.

128
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,460
When a person wearing the suit
reaches the maximum mental charge,

129
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,230
the suit will be
at its maximum performance level.

130
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,600
Mental charge?

131
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,610
See. The charge is rising, right?

132
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,640
That's good... Now, louder.

133
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,160
What's the voltage say, Akira?

134
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,900
Whoops, I forget to check the meter.

135
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,030
So you're just getting off!!

136
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,480
Good morning... A-Ki-Ra.

137
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,920
What? What happened to you?

138
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,390
It was so wonderful last night.
You're coming again tonight, aren't you?

139
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,190
Last night,
what are you talking about?

140
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,700
Oh come now Akira, it's impolite to make
a woman discuss such things publicly.

141
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,760
Yo-o-o, Akira!

142
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,800
I was so satisfied last night.
You should've stayed the whole night.

143
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,430
Huh?

144
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,340
I 'm such a tomboy, but last night
was the first time you, or anyone,

145
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,780
or anyone,
ever treated me like a woman.

146
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,040
I was so moved.

147
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,850
Akira, thanks for last night.

148
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:08,760
I will never forget how passionately
you took me in your arms.

149
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,520
Akira

150
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,000
From this day onwards,
we are lovers.

151
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,390
Huh?

152
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,200
What are you doing? Why are you
coming on to someone else's man?

153
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,440
What are YOU saying?

154
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,170
Akira is my man.

155
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,480
What a wild imagination you have.

156
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,650
Akira, unequivocally,
professed his love for me last night.

157
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,320
Me, too! He said that to me too!
Forever and ever!

158
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,090
What?!

159
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,860
He said the same thing to me.

160
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,330
Me, too!

161
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,190
What?

162
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,500
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?!

163
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,700
I... I just don't know.

164
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,110
So, you didn't just have me last night,

165
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,240
you had to go and EXPERIMENT
with all the others as well!

166
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,680
But wait a minute.

167
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,340
This is all just a misunderstanding.

168
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,380
A big misunderstanding!
Don't come near me.

169
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,950
Oh, I see... That's what it is.

170
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,690
It was I who was played for the fool.

171
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,750
And I trusted you just because
I 've known you since we were kids.

172
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,490
This kind of man is clearly
the enemy of all womankind!

173
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,720
You disappoint me, Akira.

174
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,700
Wait a second, this is all wrong!

175
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,600
Wait a second... Please...

176
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,000
I have no interest in hearing this...

177
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,010
I 'll teach you a lesson!

178
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,340
This is from Hell's Fury!!

179
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,240
Help! Help me, Reiko!

180
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,720
Lakers,
you have been completely tricked.

181
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,240
Look! A Mythical monster!

182
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,380
This is no time for an argument.

183
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,880
Lakers, we must go on the offensive.

184
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,080
WE ARE NOT HERE TO TAKE YOUR ORDERS!

185
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,220
KungFu Laker, crystal conversion!

186
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,600
Soul Laker, crystal conversion!

187
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,130
Judo Laker, crystal conversion!

188
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,500
Bunny Laker, crystal conversion!

189
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,210
Star Laker, crystal conversion!

190
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,390
Battle Team Lakers!

191
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,430
Let's go everyone...

192
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,330
Yes!!

193
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,130
W-wait a minute,
you can't do this by yourselves.

194
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,340
Damn!!
Laker Base, clear dimension!

195
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,290
Knuckle blast!

196
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,660
Sharp-angle, grind punch!

197
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,030
Tomoe Vulcan!

198
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,300
Imperial flash wave!

199
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,400
Bunny crusher!

200
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,300
It's gone??

201
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,800
Don't attack individually.

202
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,000
Re-assemble yourselves.

203
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,070
Don't tell us what to do!

204
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,280
We don't trust you.

205
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,020
Just leave us alone.

206
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,190
Bunny Crusher!

207
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,760
Tomoe Vulcan!

208
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,030
It's no use throwing the tomoe
or crusher at such short-range.

209
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,200
Soul wave attack!

210
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,830
Sparrow, super kick!

211
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,600
You idiots,
you are not reinforced defensively.

212
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,370
Don't go on the offensive until you've
shored up your defensive position.

213
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,010
Soul Laker... Kung Fu Laker...

214
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,770
I told you!

215
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,610
Oh! You look good, Lakers.

216
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,520
Oleana!

217
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,950
You made us work hard;

218
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,680
but truth be told, you're nothing more
than a troop of fools...

219
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,690
Not even a threat
to the Imperial Empire of Godram.

220
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,230
What?

221
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,160
What do you mean by that?

222
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,430
Haven't you figured it out yet?

223
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,830
The men who visited you last night,
they were produced by me.

224
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,470
Phonies?

225
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,710
Oh no! I made love to a robot?!

226
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,710
You tricked us!

227
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,940
You all fell apart
because you covet one man.

228
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,820
Earthling relationships are so fragile.

229
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,580
How can you say such a thing?

230
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,720
I won't forgive you.

231
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,620
What?

232
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,180
What's this gas?

233
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,700
Damn it!

234
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,560
My powers...

235
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,620
Oh, no...

236
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,030
God damn it!

237
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,230
My Laker suit's power is dissipating.

238
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,290
Please, power up!!

239
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,290
Akira, I 'm sorry I didn't trust you.

240
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,820
That signal indicates
that Star Laker's suit is off.

241
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,790
They can't crystal converge

242
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,090
without their mental energy level
being increased once again.

243
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,530
That's easier said than done:
They're in enemy territory.

244
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,430
Raise their mental energy using
the method you employed last night.

245
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,770
Was it really effective? By the way,
how do you know about last night?

246
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,180
Now, all I have to do is take
the Laker crystals out of your bodies

247
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,380
and the entire galaxy will be in control
of the Imperial Empire of Godram.

248
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,320
But let me enjoy myself before that...

249
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,560
You're going to feel much better soon!

250
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,910
What? What's going on?

251
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,970
This is...

252
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,440
Blade Knight!

253
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,910
Too early to rejoice. You should watch
as your prince is completely destroyed.

254
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,850
Everyone sit tight...

255
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,260
I 'm on my way!

256
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,370
Look at your prince's miserable attempt.

257
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,060
For us...

258
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,070
Blade Knight!

259
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,470
Don't get killed!

260
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,700
Blade Knight!

261
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,340
The real fun is yet to come.

262
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,150
Akira, don't come in here!

263
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,210
Reiko!

264
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,250
Oleana!

265
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,670
I 'm going to rip you to pieces
before their very eyes.

266
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,930
Are you having problems?

267
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,280
How is this happening? Are you really
a descendant of The Royal Blade Family?

268
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,880
Akira...

269
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,210
Pull yourself together, Akira!

270
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,940
Akira!

271
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,010
Akira!

272
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,310
Akira!

273
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,980
Star Laker, crystal conversion!

274
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,890
Please!
Star Laker, crystal conversion!

275
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,020
Hey, hey, hey.

276
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,460
Do you now feel my power?

277
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,660
This is good-bye...

278
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,040
Blade suit... Break!

279
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,770
What?

280
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,220
Akira, are you okay?

281
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,260
I 'm okay; and you, Reiko?

282
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,020
I can't transform
into Star Laker anymore.

283
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,060
Don't worry, leave it to me.

284
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,730
Akira, what are you doing? Now?

285
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,800
You also must touch the others.

286
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,840
It will help them recover their energy.

287
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,130
But... But... Akira.

288
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,580
It's no time to get embarrassed.
Quickly!

289
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,340
I 'm sorry, Chiaki.

290
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,470
W-w-wait a minute, Reiko.

291
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,080
Akira, don't...

292
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,090
It's really tacky
doing it in front of everyone.

293
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,420
It's embarrassing!

294
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,520
There's no time to explain right now.

295
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,230
We all must embrace each other.

296
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,220
It can't be true. Their energy levels
will rise through such an act.

297
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,520
I 'm even starting to feel
a little strange.

298
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,490
Now we'll start the real battle!

299
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,520
Wait!

300
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,710
The Mythical monster!

301
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,800
This one, again?!

302
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,180
Laker base, back us up.

303
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,460
Let's attack!

304
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,360
ROGER!

305
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,540
Here it comes.

306
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,770
Soul Laker and Bunny Laker,
attack from a safe distance.

307
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,080
Will do!

308
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,320
Imperial flash wave!

309
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,820
Bunny crusher!

310
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,390
Kung Fu Laker and Judo Laker,
attack at close range.

311
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,730
Will do!

312
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,170
Extreme explosive punch!

313
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,140
Tomoe Vulcan!

314
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,640
Now, Star Lakers!

315
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,120
Crystal power formation!

316
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,550
Star Saber!!

317
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,070
Star cyclone!

318
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,980
We've destroyed it!!!

319
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,960
Don't think you've defeated me, Lakers.

320
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,760
I will still get your crystals,
mark my words!

321
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,070
Akira...

322
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,310
Akira, after all, you were innocent.

323
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,910
I feel badly for having doubted him.

324
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,510
He's always been too horny;
and he's a space cadet...

325
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,750
But he's never cheated on any of us.

326
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,560
That's the problem...

327
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,530
What?

328
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,960
The first one Akira attended to
was Reiko, no one else.

329
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,700
But they do make an attractive couple.

330
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,380
It was a busy day.

331
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,740
I 'm so glad we were able to have
our school festival without incident.

332
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,150
The concert was a big success, too.

333
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,320
I was thinking during my performance...

334
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:49,090
the Lakers exist to protect
everyone's happiness and dreams.

335
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,190
If we prevail, everyone will have
the opportunity to learn,

336
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:55,500
to have romance in their lives,
to live and fulfill their dreams.

337
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,440
So, we must do our best.

338
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,740
Reiko, let's dance!

339
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,540
All Right!
