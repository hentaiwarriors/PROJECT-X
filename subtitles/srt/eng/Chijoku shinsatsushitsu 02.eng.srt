1
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:12,513
Hurry up!

2
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,393
Okay, which do you prefer?

3
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,741
Number one or number two?

4
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,936
N-number two, please!

5
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,273
Would you close the door, please?

6
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:40,411
S-Sure!

7
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:45,010
You've never done anal before, have you?

8
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:48,047
It's all right, calm down.

9
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:51,891
It will definitely fit!

10
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,859
It's in!

11
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:56,630
That's amazing!

12
00:00:56,664 --> 00:00:59,895
Go on, pound me!

13
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,365
You can let it all out,
right up my ass, baby.

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,270
O-Okay!

15
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:13,678
Close the door, will you?

16
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:27,152
So the spoiled brat has discovered
the joys of serving others at last.

17
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:31,256
My treatments were
just what she needed...

18
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:49,451
Don't come in!

19
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:50,218
Dr. Shameless... Examination 2
Don't come in!

20
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:50,585
Dr. Shameless... Examination 2

21
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:51,853
Dr. Shameless... Examination 2
It's embarrassing!

22
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:53,548
Dr. Shameless... Examination 2

23
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:58,057
Mother-Daughter Full Course
All-You-Can-Eat

24
00:01:58,193 --> 00:01:59,990
E-Emergency!

25
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:04,429
Please, help us! She fell
down the hill just outside...

26
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:09,128
I think she might have broken something.

27
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:11,602
She's in a lot of pain!

28
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,833
Exam Room

29
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,006
Does this hurt?

30
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:20,342
No.

31
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:21,747
How about this?

32
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,681
No, it doesn't hurt.

33
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:27,217
The hospital is in better
financial shape now...

34
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:31,918
...and the patients all seem
so much happier with us now.

35
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,092
Dr. Ishida is an amazing person...

36
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,840
Both the bone and the
ligament seem fine.

37
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:53,042
There's really no need
for an X-ray, either.

38
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:56,573
I'll write up a prescription
for compresses and painkillers.

39
00:02:57,652 --> 00:02:59,586
You should avoid all forms of
exercise for the time being.

40
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:01,312
Thank you, Doctor!

41
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,823
Thank God you weren't
seriously hurt, Tomomi.

42
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,327
Actually, Mrs. Kinoshita...

43
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:08,323
Excuse me?

44
00:03:08,763 --> 00:03:10,754
You look pale.

45
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:11,696
What?

46
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,426
Let me have a look at you.

47
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:21,674
Ms. Nagatsuka, please put a
compress on the young lady's leg.

48
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:23,806
Come this way.

49
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,889
D-Doctor, what kind
of examination is this?

50
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,490
No need to worry.

51
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:41,759
Trust me.

52
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:54,605
This smell...

53
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,506
It's quite suspicious...

54
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:00,746
I should take a look.

55
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:06,949
How lovely...

56
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:10,824
It's hard to believe that
you actually gave birth.

57
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,326
L-ls there a problem?

58
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,835
Well, recently there's
been an outbreak of a...

59
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:25,269
...new kind of STD among women your age...

60
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:26,969
STD?

61
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:38,441
I know it's my job, but I'm
getting fed up with young girls.

62
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:42,414
The timing couldn't be better, I've
been lusting after a mature woman...

63
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,683
...and here she is,
like a moth to a flame.

64
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,192
A pretty good catch, no less...

65
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:13,515
Is something the matter?

66
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:15,347
Um, no...

67
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,549
Um, Doctor?

68
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:20,387
Um...

69
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:25,428
Is this really a medical examination?

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,224
Until last year...

71
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:30,430
...I was working in L.A. As a member
of a cutting-edge medical team.

72
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,199
This is a gynecological
procedure developed by...

73
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:36,742
...renowned authorities, and has
been nominated for a Nobel Prize.

74
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,338
I'm probably the only physician
qualified to do this in Japan.

75
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:48,953
Am I hurting you in any way?

76
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,094
N-No, not really...

77
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:10,710
No sign of sexually
transmitted diseases.

78
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:13,846
However, I'd like to test
you further to be safe.

79
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,351
Please keep the blindfold on, if any light
should leak out it will skew the results.

80
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:19,818
Okay...

81
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:22,387
Please get on your hands and knees.

82
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,353
Yes, Doctor.

83
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:27,990
I'm going to take a tissue sample.

84
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:32,398
This may take a while,
but I have to be thorough.

85
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:35,798
Otherwise we run the risk
of compromising the test.

86
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:40,372
Just let me know if you get nauseous.

87
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:41,904
Yes, Doctor.

88
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,168
I'm going to insert the equipment now...

89
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,744
W-What's this?

90
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,911
I need you to relax.

91
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:53,210
I'm going to roll you into position now.

92
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:56,284
N-No!

93
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:06,261
Now I'm going to reach way
back for another sample...

94
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:14,602
Are you all right?

95
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:17,742
You look like you're in some pain.

96
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:20,405
No, I'm all right.

97
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:23,247
Please, don't stop what you're doing!

98
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:27,714
I'll be done in a minute.

99
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,623
It might get unpleasant
but please bear with me.

100
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:08,652
You can remove the blindfold now.

101
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,700
It will take about a week
for the results to come out.

102
00:08:14,635 --> 00:08:18,036
As soon as I've seen
them, I'll notify you.

103
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,664
Yes, Doctor.

104
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:34,919
Mother, what was that all about?

105
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,852
N-Nothing, he was just taking down my
history and gave me a little checkup.

106
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,925
That's it? But your complexion's
a lot better now, for some reason.

107
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,396
Oh, do you think so?

108
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:49,435
Hey Mom, that doctor was kind
of good-looking, don't you think?

109
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:53,167
And he seems really
competent, too. So unlike Dad!

110
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:54,667
Huh?

111
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:55,668
Whoops.

112
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,880
You're taking lunch now?

113
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,084
Yes...

114
00:09:16,697 --> 00:09:17,857
Um, Doctor?

115
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:24,702
Since you arrived, the hospital
has taken a turn for the better.

116
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:26,935
I wanted to thank you.

117
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:29,337
You don't have to thank me.

118
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,176
I'm just doing the job
that was given to me.

119
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,539
Still...

120
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,017
The Director is quite
the ladies' man, I see.

121
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:42,714
Huh?

122
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,318
Oh, her.

123
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:48,325
That's someone from the Sales
Dept. At M.M. Pharmaceuticals.

124
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,895
It's a business
relationship, that's all.

125
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,063
Daddy!

126
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,276
Yes!

127
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:10,044
Doctor, you're the best!

128
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:35,833
Oh, I almost forgot, Doctor...

129
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:37,877
That girl Tomomi who
was here this afternoon?

130
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:39,776
I just read all about her in a magazine!

131
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,482
She's actually made
herself a small fortune.

132
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,040
I couldn't believe it!

133
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:45,779
What are you talking about?

134
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:50,747
Well, she invented a toy called the Mole
Alien, and it's become a breakout hit.

135
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,291
I hear they're flying off the shelves.

136
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,020
She's so young, too.
I wish I could get rich!

137
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,529
I see...

138
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:00,695
Not again!

139
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:02,099
What a bummer.

140
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,538
Well, I'm about to be summoned, anyway.

141
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,442
You're pretty good at this, aren't you?

142
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:20,946
But you have to work a little harder!

143
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:22,990
Come on, we're rehabilitating you!

144
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,951
It's not easy to...

145
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:32,564
...readjust to society, is it?

146
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,504
Ow, hot!

147
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:49,578
What are you doing? You
have to keep licking!

148
00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:00,490
Yes, you're hitting my spot!

149
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:04,990
Okay, next!

150
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,996
Lick the inside of my
anus with your tongue now!

151
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,273
You've improved immeasurably!

152
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:19,479
As a reward, I'll do
something ever so nice for you!

153
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,031
You're an angel...

154
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,166
I was right, you're a real
live angel in a nurse's uniform!

155
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,682
Hey, you are...

156
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:08,326
Doctor!

157
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:12,596
It looks like that leg is doing a lot better
now, but you still need to go easy on it.

158
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:16,467
My car's parked nearby.

159
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:17,730
Why don't I drive you home?

160
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,784
Everyday is the same...

161
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,422
Yes!

162
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,094
M-More, Doctor!

163
00:15:03,744 --> 00:15:05,541
This is my house, Doctor.

164
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,645
It's quite an impressive house.

165
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,753
Mom, we have a guest!

166
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,655
I've asked Dr. Ishida to stop by!

167
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:20,820
Dr. Ishida?

168
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:21,960
Good afternoon.

169
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,031
We ran into each other at the
train station, and he drove me home.

170
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,658
Thank you, Doctor!

171
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:32,337
Well, it's very untidy but
please make yourself at home!

172
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,471
Doctor, you have to
come up to my room first.

173
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:40,113
I want to show you my Mole
Alien goods, I've got them all!

174
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:41,644
I can't wait to see them.

175
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:42,773
Shall we go, then?

176
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:45,509
Mrs. Kinoshita?

177
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:46,411
Yes, Doctor?

178
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:50,918
I'm here today to check up
on your daughter's injury.

179
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:54,459
Please, don't go to any trouble.

180
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,659
Um, if you say so...

181
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,895
What do you think about them?

182
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,234
Don't fight it.

183
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,066
It's not going to be much longer now...

184
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:26,345
Stop it!

185
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,713
How can you do that to my daughter?

186
00:17:30,324 --> 00:17:33,487
Mom, you can't come in
here! It's embarrassing.

187
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,528
We're in the middle of my treatment!

188
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,563
T-Treatment?

189
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:44,001
Nothing facilitates recovery like the
reinvigoration of the entire system...

190
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:53,312
You've just got the wrong idea.

191
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:58,373
I would diagnose you as being
mentally drained from stress.

192
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,757
Um...

193
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:18,899
Like mother, like daughter.

194
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:21,641
The resemblance is extraordinary.

195
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,007
Now, let's see what it's like inside...

196
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,250
Temperature, moisture, touch...

197
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:39,491
I cannot find anything
wrong with either of you.

198
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:42,460
Let me go in deeper...

199
00:18:56,743 --> 00:19:00,235
Mrs. Kinoshita, you still have
the drive of a young woman...

200
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:04,645
...but as far as wetness goes,
you're no match for your daughter.

201
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,213
This is an extraordinary
amount of fluid.

202
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:09,916
Oh, that's so embarrassing...

203
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:16,319
I wish I had your vibrant youth, Tomomi!

204
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,665
No need to sulk.

205
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,893
As long as a woman takes
good care of herself...

206
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:27,698
...she will only continue
to ripen with age...

207
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,445
In a sense, that's so much
more alluring than mere youth...

208
00:19:40,454 --> 00:19:43,617
I'm tingling below my waist...

209
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,293
Doctor, me too...

210
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:53,729
Everything's all right.

211
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,961
I am your doctor and
I'll take care of you.

212
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:57,897
I'm coming...

213
00:19:58,438 --> 00:19:59,462
I'm going to come!

214
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,004
I can't hold it in any
longer, I'm going to explode!

215
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:07,905
Physiological phenomena should
be left in Nature's hands.

216
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:10,810
Holding back would be
toxic to your system.

217
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,450
While I'm at it, I should take
a look at your rectal areas.

218
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:24,828
There's been a recent surge in rectal
cancer patients in this country...

219
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:30,598
Excuse me!

220
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:36,002
I guess Dr. Ishida
went out this afternoon...

221
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:45,743
Dr. Ishida...

222
00:20:51,992 --> 00:20:53,186
Anybody home?

223
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,557
Man, I'm beat.

224
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:02,926
Had another exhausting day
tap-dancing for my boss...

225
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,878
Where is everyone?

226
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:35,400
Oh my God!

227
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:37,436
What the hell is going on here?

228
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:39,436
Who the hell are you?

229
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,300
Who's this?

230
00:21:43,377 --> 00:21:45,072
He's nobody.

231
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:46,671
My loser father!

232
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,211
What do you mean, nobody?
Who are you calling a loser?

233
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:52,683
What kind of language is that?
I'm the head of this household!

234
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,588
Come on, Dad, the truth is
that you were downsized and...

235
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:58,216
...you've just been pretending
to go off to work every morning!

236
00:21:58,392 --> 00:22:00,189
You didn't think we'd find out about it?

237
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:03,960
Not to mention the fact that it was
my family who paid for this house!

238
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:07,430
If you're thinking of using Tomomi's
royalties to get out of debt...

239
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,668
...you have another
thing coming, you loser!

240
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,428
I see...

241
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:15,367
If that's the case, why
don't you just get rid of him?

242
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:19,505
The two of you should spend
Tomomi's money as you please.

243
00:22:20,514 --> 00:22:23,415
There are so many ways to
put it to use for society!

244
00:22:23,984 --> 00:22:27,249
For instance, if you were to
make a donation to my hospital...

245
00:22:27,454 --> 00:22:30,082
...you would be helping
out so many patients!

246
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,418
The hospital can have my money!

247
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:34,221
If it makes you happy, Doctor,
I'll donate as much as you want!

248
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:36,729
Have you lost your minds?

249
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:39,823
Hey, what are you doing?

250
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:42,733
Let me go!

251
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:23,600
Please, Doctor, examine me too!

252
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:24,905
Hurry!

253
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:37,183
Deeper, all the way!

254
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,671
My stomach's on fire!

255
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,515
It feels amazing!

256
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:54,526
I'll be winding up my examination soon...

257
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:56,962
I-I'm almost there...

258
00:24:57,938 --> 00:24:58,768
Yes!

259
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:01,635
It feels too good to be
true, I'm going to die!

260
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,506
That word is taboo in
the presence of a doctor.

261
00:25:06,146 --> 00:25:08,614
Can't help it, it's true!

262
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,426
Well, I suppose I can't blame
you, with a "provider" like that...

263
00:25:21,161 --> 00:25:23,652
Please, take care of mine too!

264
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:33,431
I know! You should become
our provider, Doctor.

265
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,787
I saw what you were doing!

266
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,659
I knew it!

267
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,530
No, you've got it wrong!

268
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:07,797
Anyway, he's probably the type who
hates it when co-workers moon over him.

269
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:12,638
If he finds out about you, he'll
probably leave the hospital.

270
00:26:12,712 --> 00:26:13,872
No, he wouldn't...

271
00:26:14,314 --> 00:26:18,307
If you want him to stay, you're
going to have to do as I say!

272
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:19,010
Huh?

273
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:20,477
What are you doing?

274
00:26:20,554 --> 00:26:21,646
No!

275
00:26:21,855 --> 00:26:25,086
Now then, let me do something
ever so nice for you!

276
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:39,633
The breadwinner of
the family should be...

277
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:44,941
Big, hard and juicy...

278
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:49,013
