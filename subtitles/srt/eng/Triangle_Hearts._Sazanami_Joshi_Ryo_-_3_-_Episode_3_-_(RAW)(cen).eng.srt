1
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,589
The wind's started getting colder again,

2
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,940
and has been making that all too familiar 'swooshing' noise.

3
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,465
Once again, Kaoru's younger sisters are here.

4
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,270
SubDESU-H Presents
"A Wind named Kaoru"

5
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,780
We're back!

6
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,900
Welcome back!

7
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,900
Welcome back, Nami!

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,340
It's good to be back, Mio-chan!

9
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:09,470
<i>I'm Nami! I'm Kaoru-tan's younger sister, and I'm doing my best to grow up all lady-like.</i>

10
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,610
<i>And this is my kitten Tora-chan. Tora-chan and I are best friends.</i>

11
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,540
You're great, Nami-chan!

12
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,610
Oh, not really.

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
I want to try too!

14
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,110
Me too!

15
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,420
Ah, the blessed ignorance of youth!

16
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,260
Huh? Mayuki-san!

17
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,180
Aren't you cold?

18
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,680
Me? Heck, I was a snow baby.

19
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,870
Ok, but do you really think it's a good idea to dress like that in front of other people?

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,550
Dude, there's nobody here but Kosuke and the girls.

21
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,280
Mayuki-san?

22
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,490
Hey, Hayumi-chan... You're taking good care of these, right?

23
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,420
How about I give them a massage for you?

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,510
Oh hey, Kanzaki, you're back, huh?

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,950
What are you doing to my sister?

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,580
Nothin'...

27
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,400
Hayumi-san, are you ok?

28
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,740
Holy crap! Mayuki-san caught a sword with her hands! That's awesome!

29
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,750
Uh, thank you.

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,800
Hayumi-san, don't encourage her.

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,540
Huh? Why?

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,630
Because I said so!

33
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,944
This is Hayumi-san. Just like Kaoru-san, she's a great sword fighter.

34
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:26,752
Came in 3rd in her district. She's pretty cool.

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,260
I'm over here, talking with the girls. I love coming to visit with them just to talk.

36
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,690
Wow! You're so good at that, Mio-chan!

37
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,320
This kinda thing is no big deal. {QCer's Note: This had "Meh," at the start of the line but that seemed weird so I cut it}

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,350
I can do it too!

39
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,010
Look out, Nami-chan!

40
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,710
Nami-chan!

41
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,290
What the hell are you guys doing over here, anyway?

42
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,110
What the... Are you ok?

43
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,170
Nami-chan, I'm sorry!

44
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,210
Uh... It's ok...

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,740
This is the kinda fun we get to have. It's a girl thing.

46
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,450
Oh, sorry to have kept you waiting.

47
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,640
This is the Sazanami Girls' Dorm, right?

48
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,170
Yes, that's right...

49
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,560
Greetings, I am Kanzaki Kaede.

50
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,080
Kanzaki...?

51
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,010
Please deliver this to Kaoru.

52
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,000
Well then...

53
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,250
W-Wait a minute...

54
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,600
Yes?

55
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,880
Are you part of Kaoru-chan's family?

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,520
Yes... I am her cousin. {This was down as "younger sister" but it sounded like she said Itoko which means Cousin}

57
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,540
Well Kaoru-san is actually here right now... You want me to get her?

58
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:31,960
No.

59
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,550
Kaede-chan?

60
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,440
Nami-chan...? Why are you...?

61
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,260
Hey, Hayumi-san! Kaede-chan is here!

62
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,800
What? Hayumi-san is here as well?

63
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,750
Oh, hello, Kaede-chan... What brings you here?

64
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,010
My parents asked me for a favor...

65
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:49,980
Kaoru.

66
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,920
Kaede?

67
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:03,200
Oh, I see... Your parents asked you to give me a message. Thank you.

68
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,630
It's no big deal...

69
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,990
You must be tired. You should rest for a bit.

70
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,950
I won't give you a choice, Kaede-chan!

71
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:23,630
So, as you can see, Kaoru-chan, Kaede-chan, and I all study at the same dojo.

72
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,580
That's awesome!

73
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,860
Really? So you both go around yelling 'haiya' and stuff, just like Kaoru-chan?

74
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,850
No... Unlike Kaoru, I wield one of the legendary weapons, a short sword called a 'Nagisa'.

75
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,990
Oh, really?

76
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,110
I specialize in a slightly different style which utilizes my favored weapon.

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,730
How cool!

78
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,890
That said, Kaede is still a beginner.

79
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,990
Yes, it might still be too early to call Kaede-chan a master.

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,930
What did she mean by 'legendary weapons'?

81
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,340
They are sister weapons.

82
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,580
I wield the katana 'Ittouryu'.

83
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,960
Hayumi-san uses a bow named 'Shinmeiryu'. {Was listed as 'Shintoryu' but that sounded wrong, could someone who can read Kanji check it?}

84
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,900
Kaede uses the short sword 'Fugetsuryu'.

85
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,620
Nami belongs to the Ittoryu school, but she doesn't have a weapon yet.

86
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,870
Oh really? So you must all have been too busy to really connect.

87
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:25,130
Not really... These two were always joined at the hip.

88
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,230
Oh...? Is that how it was...

89
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,150
I was just helping out Kaoru-san with her training, that's all...

90
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,540
Really? It looked like you were loving every second!

91
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,070
No! I was against it from the start!

92
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,060
Wow... You really are two peas in a pod! I bet you've always been best friends!

93
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,600
We are NOT friends!

94
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,280
Look out for the submarine!

95
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,320
You really are amazing, Mio-chan!

96
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,000
Kaede-chan... Shall I wash your back for you? {Original was "Shall I help you scrub?", but she said the same thing a few seconds later and the translation for that seemed more accurate}

97
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,780
N-no! I can handle this myself, thank you!

98
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,900
Oh...?

99
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,790
Kaoru-chan. Shall I wash your back for you?

100
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,140
Thank you very much!

101
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,190
But before that, if I don't get this little guy clean...

102
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,410
Alright then... I'll get you all clean, ok?

103
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,910
What... Kaoru-chan! Those wounds!

104
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,190
Don't tell me...

105
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,650
Oh... That's from a previous job.

106
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,280
Kaoru-chan... You aren't overworking yourself, right?

107
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,110
Hayumi-san, you don't have to worry about me.

108
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,070
Kaede, what's the matter?

109
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,500
Kaoru, will you go a round with me?

110
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,570
Sure. Let me get some wooden swords.

111
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,420
Kaoru.

112
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,480
Let's do it with live steel.

113
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,600
But...

114
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,340
Don't worry, I'm not a kid anymore.

115
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,040
Ok...

116
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,050
Ok... Here I come!

117
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,470
What's wrong, Onii-chan?

118
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,350
It looks like Kaede and Kaoru are going at it for real.

119
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,690
Secret Technique! 'Fugetsuryu'!

120
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:10,765
Commence!

121
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,850
Kaede-chan, you mustn't!

122
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,520
'Winning Strike'!

123
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,070
Looks like you came up with a great technique there. That was amazing!

124
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,400
When I was your age there's no way I could have done something like that.

125
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,210
If that's the case...

126
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,040
If that's the case, then why
won't you fight me seriously?!

127
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,180
Kaede...

128
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,980
How can you say that and
then still fight me like that...?

129
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,660
Kaede!

130
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,030
Kaede-chan!

131
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,500
Kaede-chan was crying...

132
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,630
It was Kaoru's fault.

133
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,160
Why was it my fault?

134
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,920
Why was it Kaoru-san's fault anyways?

135
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,210
Because Kaoru-chan is still fighting Kaede-chan with kid gloves.

136
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,060
But... But I went all out...

137
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,680
Kaoru... {I'm not sure if this is right, it was split from a line that didn't have this in there, I couldn't hear what she was talking over the line already in progress}
But... But I went all out...

138
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,870
I think you know you didn't...

139
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,360
Weren't you holding back even a little?

140
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,560
Well, what do you expect me to do..?

141
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,420
I think you of all people know what you need to do.

142
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,590
B-but...

143
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,700
But I... I have no idea...

144
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:53,820
<i>Kaoru-chan... You really haven't changed, have you? Even after all these years.</i>

145
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,840
Man, it's quiet...

146
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,070
It is, isn't it.

147
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,630
Maybe it would have been better for you to go out with everyone?

148
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,610
Oh, I didn't mean I don't want you around...

149
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,380
Not at all.

150
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,680
Oh, right! I have to go swap out the laundry!

151
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll help out!

152
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,630
Naw that's ok. Just relax and watch some TV or something.

153
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,770
But I...

154
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,120
Kosuke-san...!

155
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,900
Hello, this is Kanzaki Kaede. {QCer's Note: This line seems like it needs looked over}

156
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,690
Is... Is this the work Kaoru was talking about?

157
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,500
Finally done!

158
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,180
Kaede-chan! You want to go grab some food...?

159
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,600
What the...

160
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,730
<i>Dear Kosuke-san, sorry I had to step out.
Thank you for the green tea
and sweet bean cake. Kaede. {note}</i>

161
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,020
Evil Spirit extermination, huh?

162
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,470
That must be it... The seals are corrupted...

163
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,440
It's no surprise that seals like that wouldn't hold back a spirit.

164
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,380
All right! Let's give it a try!

165
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,900
I did it!

166
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,010
Nothing is coming out!

167
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,260
Did I fail?

168
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,620
This... This isn't any Evil Spirit. It's a Demon!

169
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,540
If I can just defeat this Demon,
then Kaoru will finally...

170
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,530
All right... It looks like I can do this!

171
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,320
Secret Technique! 'Kanzaki Fugetsuryu' - Commence!

172
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,500
'Senyuuha'!

173
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,290
I did it! I exorcised the Demon!

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,550
I really can do it!

175
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,880
This sweet thing is delicious!

176
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,110
It's Marron-Glace.

177
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,510
Oh? Well, thank you.

178
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,130
Wow, you really are a good cook, Kosuke-san. This cheesecake is the best!

179
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Kaede-chan...

180
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,360
What's with the cut on your neck?

181
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,420
Oh... Uh... It's nothing!

182
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,750
Oh, Kosuke-san, I'm loving the cake, but could I trouble you for something else to eat?

183
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,280
Oh, sure... I'll go grab you something.

184
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,080
Kosuke-kun, get me something too!

185
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,020
Me too!

186
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,550
Me too!

187
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,030
I want more to eat too!

188
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,060
Me too!

189
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,390
I guess I'll have some too!

190
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,700
Kosuke-san! One more round of cake for everyone!

191
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,840
Yeah, yeah...

192
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,510
Kosuke! Get some beer too!

193
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,350
Coming up!

194
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,730
Oh, Kaoru... We're having cake.

195
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,420
Thank you very much!

196
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,940
Mayuki-san, you're a manga writer, right?

197
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,900
Pretty much.

198
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,100
Wow, that's awesome!

199
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes, this is the Sazanami Girls' Dorm...

200
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:58,500
What? The evil spirit...? The person I sent today? But I didn't send...

201
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,380
It must have been Kaede...

202
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,860
Yes... Not at all... Thank you for the business...

203
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,670
Everyone! Sorry to keep you waiting!

204
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,120
Took you long enough!

205
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,420
Kaoru... You want some cake... Hey, what's the matter?

206
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,930
Kaoru... Come have some cake! Look, we even have your favorite strawberry cake...

207
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,640
Hey... What's the matter?

208
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,490
Kaede...

209
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,100
What are you doing..?

210
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:33,370
Oh, you mean about your work? I took care of it for you! If it's just a spirit, then I can...

211
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,730
What was that for?

212
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,870
Don't you get it?

213
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,610
Why would you do that?

214
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,170
Well, you were out with the girls and...

215
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,500
You could have called my cell phone!

216
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,330
But... But I defeated it.

217
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,220
That isn't the point!

218
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,860
Evil spirits are a big deal...
What if you couldn't handle it?

219
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,960
You could have died!

220
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,250
But I'm still a Kanzaki! I can fight.

221
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,630
It's still far too early for you to be taking jobs...

222
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,280
There's nothing we can do about today, but don't let me catch you doing it again!

223
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,740
You're always like this...

224
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,460
You are always putting me down by acting so cool... When is it going to be my turn?!

225
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,500
I hate you, Kaoru!

226
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,800
Kaede-chan!

227
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Kaoru-chan...

228
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,090
I'm at a loss...

229
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,470
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid Kaoru!

230
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:53,990
This is the...

231
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,940
From before...

232
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,590
But I definitely defeated this guy...

233
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,540
Kaoru!

234
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,010
Kaede! Where have you been?

235
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,540
I was so worried! I said some
things I shouldn't have...

236
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,290
What's wrong?

237
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,750
What are you doing?!

238
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,860
Kaede, what are you...

239
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,350
You've been possessed!

240
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,920
Kaede, what are you...

241
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,160
I can't... Move my body...

242
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,330
Kaoru...

243
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,530
You smell greaaaat...

244
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,150
Kaoru...

245
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,350
I love you...

246
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:26,010
And this arm... This hand...
This finger... I love all of it...

247
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,780
She's being completely controlled!

248
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,440
Kaoru... Does it feel good?

249
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,010
Kaoru... You want me, don't you?

250
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,230
You know I adore you, don't you?

251
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,770
I want to be like you and take in all of you!

252
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,190
But you know what...? I can't be like you...

253
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,400
To be strong... To be able to
defeat powerful opponents...

254
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,220
Do you really want to be a master that badly?

255
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,920
When I first became a master...

256
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,590
On my seventh mission...

257
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,240
Just before I came across a powerful demon...

258
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,020
I was almost defeated.

259
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:26,000
Of course, at that time, I, you and Hayumi were all small children...

260
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,220
Our mothers were called upon to exorcise the demon.

261
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,440
However, the demon was too powerful,
and our mothers were unable to restrain it...

262
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,127
Then when mother fell unconscious, even I couldn't do anything,

263
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:57,145
and I had to call Oba-chan to help...
{QC's note Could someone check that Oba-chan? I'm not sure if she was saying aunt or grandma, she was talking about their mothers so I'm just guessing, it was hard to tell}

264
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,660
That beast was Kuon, and she sealed him in the body of a kitten.

265
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,293
But if he were ever to turn back and attack...

266
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:13,570
Perhaps attack Nami...

267
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:17,318
I would have to be the one to kill him!

268
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,354
And I know it hurts, but you know what?

269
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:26,724
I don't mind having to shoulder that kind of stuff myself!

270
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,900
I don't want you to have to
shoulder this kind of pain!

271
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,040
But... Even so...

272
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,500
It may be a bother to you, but...

273
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,070
I want to walk the same road as you!

274
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,590
Ka...e...de...

275
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,310
You really think I'll let you get away?!

276
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:16,900
I am...

277
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,350
You were possessed.

278
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,320
What about Kaoru?

279
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,040
She went after that evil spirit.

280
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,220
We're also heading out.

281
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,310
Well, then.

282
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,202
Wait!

283
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:30,263
Please wait.

284
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:32,693
Me too... Please take me with you...

285
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,801
Because I am also a Kanzaki!

286
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,360
Kaoru!

287
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,600
Kaoru-chan!

288
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,920
Don't look away.

289
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,840
This is what Kaoru... No... This is what we all must fight against!

290
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,210
If Kuon attacks Nami... I would have to be the one to kill him!

291
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,330
I'm fine shouldering that
kind of responsibility alone!

292
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,600
It's terrible isn't it? The work of an exorcist...

293
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,000
But you know what?

294
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,510
I'm glad I was born a Kanzaki.

Kaoru-san... Did that do it?

300
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,810
Kaede...

301
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,110
Kaoru... Let me help too...

302
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,652
I'm partly responsible for this!

303
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,300
Ok, Kaede! Let's do this!

304
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,540
Got it!

Everyone! It's really been great!

311
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,110
Come again!

312
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,930
We'll always be here.

313
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,230
Nami... Are you leaving..?

314
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,230
I'm so sad...

315
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,220
Mio-chan...

316
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,460
It's ok. Nami and the girls will come back soon.

317
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,880
You mean it?

318
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,720
Yep. I mean it.

319
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,360
I swear I'll come back, Mio-chan, so...

320
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,320
Ok, then pinky-swear on it!

321
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,750
Ok!

322
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,630
Kaede. Please give my best to your parents.

323
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,880
Next time...

324
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,810
Let's have a real match!

325
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,330
Ok! I'll do my best to be stronger by then!

326
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,200
I can't wait.

327
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,300
And so, Hayumi and the others returned home.

328
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,600
Nami-chan seemed like she was going to burst into tears, but she did her best to grin and bear it.

329
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,890
It seemed like Kaede finally had a real smile.

330
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,720
And then...

331
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,290
I'm back!

332
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,480
Chika-chan?

333
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,240
Kaede-chan?

334
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,370
Has your fever come down?

335
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,430
Yep. Looks like it'll be gone very soon.

336
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,640
That's fantastic!

337
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,960
Hey! I brought cake, so let's dig in!

338
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,960
I brought your favorite!

339
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,370
I'm so happy!

340
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,410
All right, then see you downstairs, ok?

341
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,420
Thank you!

342
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,500
Everyone! I brought some cake home!

343
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,710
I want to eat it!

344
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,240
Looks awesome.

345
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:04,520
- You got it... Kaede-chan transferred to our school.

346
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,900
- What kind of cake is it?

348

350
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,530
Oh, is Kaede back?

351
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,230
Kaoru!

352
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:13,660
- It looks like Kaede is really happy to be with Kaoru! It seems like it'll be a great time!

I've become great friends with Kaede-chan as well, so I'm happy!
