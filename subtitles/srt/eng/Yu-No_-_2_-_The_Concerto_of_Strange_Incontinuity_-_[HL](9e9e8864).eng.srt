00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,210
<i>Things seem to happen at random</i>
<i>but it actually follows a planned route.</i>

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,380
<i>That becomes cause and effect.</i>

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,690
<i>The power of the ring.</i>

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,320
<i>Allows you to...</i>

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,420
<i>bend that rule to your will.</i>

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,930
<i>Blue light leads the way,</i>
<i>black leads to destruction.</i>

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,420
<i>The polarity of the soul.</i>

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,160
<i>Who are you?</i>

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,900
<i>Just like you.</i>

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,430
<i>We are both related to my father.</i>

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,900
We are related?

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,220
What's wrong?

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,220
No, nothing.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,290
You don't like being with women?

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,270
Open up to me.

16
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,910
I want to know more about you.

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,020
Episode 2:
"The concerto of strange incontinuity"

18
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,790
There's been a lot of protest
by the local residents...

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,420
against the construction going on
around the Ken point, at the lake.

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,890
They're protesting daily.

21
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,330
And your mother is apparently responsible
for all the construction there.

22
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,400
This is apparently what she found.

23
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,750
I didn't know you knew her ID password.

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,540
Made things much easier for me.

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,220
Thank you.

26
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,540
So, Takuya...

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,980
I wasn't necessarily trying to help you.

28
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,650
So, what is this stone?

29
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,560
An old legend from this city
always warned people...

30
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,860
to stay away from the Ken point,
at the lake.

31
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,370
The fire of life.

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,960
What are you doing?

33
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,540
Something like this!

34
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,870
I can't, Mitsuki!

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,640
I can't do this anymore.

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,920
When we're alone by ourselves,
just the two of us...

37
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,190
you can be a woman, not a mother.

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,530
No!

39
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,300
Please, Mitsuki, we can't do this anymore.

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,730
We can't turn back now.

41
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,270
I know you want to see him, right?

42
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,900
Him? Who are you talking about?

43
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,340
Well...

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,610
What are you hiding from me, Mitsuki!

45
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,220
All the money spend to excavate this rock...

46
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,860
I suppose most of us can't understand
how rich people think.

47
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,500
It's a real puzzle.

48
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,570
What are you talking about?

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,290
What are you two doing in there?

50
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,170
They came faster than I expected.

51
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,800
Let's go!

52
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,920
Hold it!

53
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,020
This is going to be a serious problem.

54
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,090
Ayumi.

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,760
You can tell me, Takuya.

56
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,410
Who is she?

57
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,740
What does she want with the stone?

58
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,650
I swear I don't know.

59
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,080
I know you're not going to believe me!

60
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,510
Wait a minute!

61
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,380
I'm sorry Ayumi!

62
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,590
Wait, Takuya!

63
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,560
Leaving?

64
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,030
How about one more time?

65
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,800
I have to go now.

66
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,560
You are coming tomorrow?

67
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,740
If you want.

68
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,600
I'll be waiting.

69
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,330
Meow!

70
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,470
So where is it?

71
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,480
Don't rush me.

72
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,580
I need to shower.

73
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,740
I gave you the pin code last week.

74
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,710
Use it as you like.

75
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,690
Do you trust me?

76
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,090
I'd like you to think so.

77
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,100
The locker I showed you.

78
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,930
It will be in there.

79
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,360
After I get what I asked for, of course.

80
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,570
You're careful!

81
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm a pro.

82
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,140
All right, just be sure to take care of it.

83
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,240
Be especially careful around water.

84
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,780
I know.

85
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,720
Take your time.

86
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,980
Before I forget.

87
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,190
The uniform I borrowed.

88
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,520
It's way too short.

89
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,830
I was practically flashing everyone.

90
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,770
Some women like to be seen, you know.

91
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,210
Shit, where did she go?

92
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,170
I should have at least asked for her name.

93
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,930
I'm feeling very weak.

94
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,160
You are...

95
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,040
Canna Hatano.

96
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,910
Who are you?

97
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,860
That's something daddy's
going to find out for himself.

98
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,190
All I can do is wait for you.

99
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,130
Hold on!

100
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,960
I'll be waiting, papa.

101
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,590
I'll fix both of us some breakfast.

102
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,990
I think it's almost ready.

103
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,030
Sure.

104
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,600
I passed out after that.

105
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,480
You used up too much power too quickly,
so your body couldn't adjust.

106
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,310
Do you know what's going on?

107
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,250
What's going on around me?

108
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,380
There's nothing I can really do for you.

109
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,580
That's all I can say.

110
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,690
Is it good?

111
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,730
I want to ask you something.

112
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,570
I live alone.

113
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,700
I'm by myself.

114
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,870
My mother passed away.

115
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,310
My father.

116
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,840
He lives near here, but I don't think
he knows anything about me.

117
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,390
What is it?

118
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,850
I have to go.

119
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,160
Just return my keys in the mailbox.

120
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,170
Are you leaving?

121
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,100
Now?

122
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,130
It's important.

123
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,910
What the hell.

124
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,380
I don't understand what's happening to me.

125
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,350
That girl.

126
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,320
Wow!

127
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,660
See?

128
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,060
The older guys really go for that look.

129
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,270
Don't you think?

130
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,800
You'd look good in a paper bag, Canna.

131
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,970
She's the number one,
most requested girl here.

132
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,600
Hiya!

133
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,080
That's Sakaimachi Academy's uniform.

134
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,650
I'm a student there.

135
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,950
Do you know Miyo Shimizu?

136
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,380
The daughter of the treasurer.

137
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,520
No wonder she's so wealthy.

138
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,660
Canna, you have a customer.

139
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,090
Wait!

140
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,760
You're leaving like that?

141
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,330
I'll be wearing my skirt.

142
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,600
With your bloomers?

143
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,700
They like this kind of stuff.

144
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,310
Okay.

145
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,650
She's not coming out.

146
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,090
What's she doing?

147
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,560
I'll find out.

148
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,030
What is Canna doing here?

149
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,530
Canna Hatano.

150
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,580
You know there's rumors about her.

151
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,540
Do you want to eat first?

152
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,780
I don't think this is right.

153
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,480
Do you know what you're doing?

154
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,850
I do this so I can survive.

155
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,660
Stop it, and put on some clothes.

156
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,930
The only people that really need me
here are my clients.

157
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,960
This is the only reason I continue
to remain in this world.

158
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,730
Remain in this world?

159
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,670
You scared off my client for the day.

160
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,880
Sleep with me.

161
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,660
What a shame.

162
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,280
It's not a ring.

163
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,690
With our technology...

164
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,660
this is the best we can do.

165
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,260
How sad.

166
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,190
Miyo, is that you?

167
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,830
I didn't know Canna was
in possession of one.

168
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,040
You're acting weird today.

169
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,570
What's wrong with you?

170
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,610
There's nothing wrong with me.

171
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,250
Right, Canna?

172
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,280
Give me the pendant.

173
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,990
I can't, I'll die without it.

174
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,450
I'll have to force you.

175
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,060
Stop it, Miyo!

176
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,730
Get out of my way!

177
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,140
This is...

178
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,670
Why am I?

179
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,770
What am I?

180
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,510
Takuya, the asshole!

181
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,980
Where could he possibly be
so late at night?

182
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,990
Hey Ayumi!

183
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,630
He acts like he really cares about me.

184
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,030
So why isn't he here to pick me up?

185
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,600
Ayumi, I'm here.

186
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,160
What is this?

187
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,070
I should have had Toyotomi take me home.

188
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,910
What are you saying?

189
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,910
Did I hear something?

190
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,920
Teleportation.

191
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,520
Without the key?

192
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,390
Run, Takuya, right now!

193
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,160
Give it to me!

194
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,200
Miyo is not herself right now!

195
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,860
I'm totally lost here.

196
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,340
Again?

197
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,970
Let me go!

198
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,680
Let go of me!

199
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,210
Are you okay, papa?

200
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,450
You again.

201
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,760
You teleported too many times,
so things are starting to destabilize, papa.

202
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,220
Are you saying I'm your father?

203
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,060
Papa is papa, right?

204
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,830
I think you can get up now,
but how do you feel?

205
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,510
I can see your underwear, Ms. Eriko.

206
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,470
You're doing fine.

207
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,000
Where is Canna, Miyo?

208
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,910
How should I know?

209
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,410
I'm going to continue my walk.

210
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,050
You should be home
doing your homework, kid.

211
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,330
Don't be hanging out, wasting your time!

212
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,960
I thought I heard something.

213
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,830
Do you have to get drunk to hit on a guy?

214
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,410
That's just so uncool.

215
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,740
I can see your underwear, ma'am.

216
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,470
I don't really have any interest
in you as a person...

217
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,080
but I do want to know more about
what you're studying in your lab.

218
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,450
No!

219
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,920
Stop!

220
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,600
Please!

221
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,290
Tell me your ID code.

222
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,890
No, let me go!

223
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,230
Do you like fooling around in the car?

224
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,210
Get off me!

225
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,300
Why are you doing this?

226
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,210
She looks pretty damn good for her age.

227
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,020
She's not just a mature woman.

228
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,760
Widow, she's a widow.

229
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,230
That sounds like something special!

230
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,260
I can make you forget...

231
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,230
about your dead husband tonight!

232
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,630
Why are you doing this?

233
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,260
Money, and we're very bored.

234
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,540
These girls are really good at what they do.

235
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,210
I can make them stop right away...

236
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,510
if you tell me your ID code.

237
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,110
No!

238
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,780
I can't!

239
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,150
What's going on there!

240
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,060
Is there something wrong with me?

241
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,560
Hey, little punk!

242
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,440
Hi Mitsuki!

243
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,370
You might want to go home
and console your mother.

244
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,380
Unless you're waiting for your date
here or something.

245
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,150
What's wrong?

246
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,790
Are you feeling better?

247
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,860
Yes.

248
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,730
Thank you, Toyotomi.

249
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,670
This will make you feel better.

250
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,370
How did you find me?

251
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,400
I know everything abut my boss.

252
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,270
I need to go change.

253
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,560
Toyotomi!

254
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,560
I didn't know you wore lingerie.

255
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,540
I would love to see you in one.

256
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,180
This makes me feel
like I'm very close to you.

257
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,640
Out!

258
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,610
Out, this isn't fair.

259
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,490
Things between a man and a woman
is never fair.

260
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,690
No!

261
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,960
Stop!

262
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,530
You should just forget about everything.

263
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,460
About tonight.

264
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,030
About your late husband.

265
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,070
I can't.

266
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,880
Now, spread your legs.

267
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,810
I can't!

268
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,140
Just do as I say!

269
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,790
That's right!

270
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,650
I'll help you forget those bad memories.

271
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,080
Toyotomi.

272
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,820
I'm home!

273
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,250
I'm coming!

274
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,530
Takuy, you...

275
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,510
He rescued you from getting raped?

276
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,310
This sounds really fishy.

277
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,080
He's tricking you, Ayumi.

278
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,980
Even if you're right...

279
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,150
Sometimes ignorance is bliss.

280
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,020
I'm not...

281
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,230
I'm not strong, I don't like to be alone.

282
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,600
But, I'm here.

283
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,000
I am your mother.

284
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,370
I need a lover.

285
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:29,240
It's not like I can talk to you
about a lot of things.

286
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,570
But...

287
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,340
Why?

288
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,610
You see, kid?

289
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,590
She doesn't need your help anymore.

290
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,920
Is that true, Ayumi?

291
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,180
You don't need me?

292
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,430
I don't need you.

293
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,070
I don't need you to help me!

294
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,100
Don't let them fool you!

295
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,460
Canna?

296
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,110
She waiting for you, in a world far away.

297
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,280
Need papa's help.

298
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,470
Nobody's waiting for you.

299
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,680
She likes being with me, and you know it.

300
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,820
Just forget about her and leave her to me.

301
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,760
Don't forget anyone, papa!

302
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,120
Otherwise, you'll never see them!

303
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,000
You'll never see mama...

304
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,820
or Yu-no.

305
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,560
Yu-no.

306
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,960
Just give me the damned pendant!

307
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,870
I can't.

308
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,470
You.

309
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,970
Damn it!

310
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,910
Miyo, stop it!

311
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,720
Mr. Teleportation is with us again!

312
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,650
- You can't.
- What?

313
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,560
Right now, Miyo is not
the person you know.

314
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,860
What can I do?

315
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,700
What happened to her?

316
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,430
None of your business!

317
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,440
Without the key, and if we get rid
of the pendant.

318
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,070
You won't be able to teleport anymore at all.

319
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,880
Everything will be back to normal.

320
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,120
No one will suffer again!

321
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,750
Don't you agree, Canna?

322
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,250
You're wrong.

323
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,750
That's not true.

324
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,360
Don't Canna, it's dangerous!

325
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,490
I know of a way to bring Miyo back
to her true self.

326
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,140
It's okay.

327
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,600
I will take your spell away.

328
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,620
Miyo?

329
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,310
Takuya, you...

330
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,800
I don't think it worked.

331
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,120
Who the hell are you?

332
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,970
Takuya?

333
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,130
After.

334
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,510
Take care of her, papa.

335
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,880
Canna!

336
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,240
Canna, what's wrong!

337
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,610
She can't live without
her pendant, she's dying.

338
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,590
Takuya, please.

339
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,890
Are you okay?

340
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,500
You can't?

341
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,100
This is the first time I felt afraid
of dying in my entire life.

342
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,100
Did you know I always hated you?

343
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,580
But I think I lived this long
so I could meet you.

344
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,620
Stop it, Canna!

345
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,550
Don't!

346
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,190
Answer me!

347
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,220
Canna, Canna!

348
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,130
To Be Continued
