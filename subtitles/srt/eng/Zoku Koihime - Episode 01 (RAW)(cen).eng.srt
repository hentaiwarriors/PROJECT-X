1
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,690
At last I have finally returned.

2
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,150
I thought I had lost my way.

3
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,240
You did a good job getting here.

4
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,920
Even though I grew up in this village, this is the first time I've been back.

5
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,710
It's been 15 years.

6
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,090
Yeah...

7
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,510
But I feel like I was last here earlier than that. No that can't be.

8
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,730
Musashi-chan!

9
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,900
Musashi-chan, I missed you!

10
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,230
I wanted to hug you for so long.

11
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,860
Ah, you were my childhood friend...

12
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,530
Oh, you remember me?

13
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,450
Your name was...

14
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:29,282
An...

15
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,660
An?

16
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,330
It's not?

17
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,050
Then... um.. Na?

18
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,750
Na?

19
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,960
Su?

20
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:40,970
Su?!

21
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,630
Ma?

22
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,010
Ma?!

23
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,060
It's Tamamo.

24
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,810
Right, right. It's Tamamo. Long time no see.

25
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,110
What are you doing?

26
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,740
What was I doing...?

27
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,820
Do you really remember me?

28
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,620
Well, actually...

29
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,830
Sorry, I don't remember you at all.

30
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,450
That's all right.

31
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,380
Since you have come back

32
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,460
I'm so happy

33
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,920
You are such good friends.
Just like when you were young.

34
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,010
Yeah...

35
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,850
I'm too old to be up.

36
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,770
Please clean up the fire okay?

37
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,310
Okay.

38
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,440
Good Night.

39
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,280
What's wrong?

40
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,160
Nothing is wrong. Good night.

41
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,820
Good night.

42
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,330
Something smells good.

43
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:58,000
Musashi-chan. Can I spend the night with you?

44
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,590
I've been waiting so long for you.

45
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,010
For me?

46
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,090
Yeah.

47
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,600
I decided a long time ago I wanted you to be my first.

48
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,980
Tamamo-chan...

49
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,060
Do you really feel that way towards me?

50
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,900
Yeah...

51
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,150
What should? Now that you are here I feel a little shy.

52
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,910
She's so cute!

53
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,120
I can't believe she waited for me this long! It's like a dream.

54
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,910
Wait a minute, this is too good to be true. She
wants to but I don't remember her at all.

55
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,380
Everybody may be in on it and are trying to trick me.

56
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,300
That's it, it's a trap. It has to be!

57
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,260
I'll have a stupid look after I *#%@!* with her when
the guy with a camera appears and then

58
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,100
That smell... my mind's going blank.

59
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,640
I can't think properly.

60
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,900
Tamamo-chan.

61
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,190
Musashi-chan.

62
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,360
Please hold me!

63
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,120
I can't stop shaking even though I'm not cold.

64
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,200
Like this?

65
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,120
Hold me tighter.

66
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,920
She's shaking so much. Is this really her first time?

67
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,250
Does it matter if this is a trap?

68
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,590
Have you calmed down?

69
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,720
Yeah.

70
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,010
Musashi-chan. Thank you.

71
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,070
Tamomo-chan, are you scared?

72
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,660
Not at all. You're so gentle.

73
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,492
Really?

74
00:06:58,492 --> 00:06:59,542
Yeah.

75
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,710
Musashi-chan, I love you.

76
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,550
That tickles.

77
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,220
It feels so good.

78
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,720
Do it gently.

79
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,260
Yes, like that.

80
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,020
That feels good.

81
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,520
No, if you do that they'll get bigger.

82
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,450
Not there!

83
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,580
S-Stop...

84
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,870
No, not there!

85
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,170
You're oil wet...

86
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,670
Because it feels good.

87
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,050
You're so sensitive.

88
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,010
Tamamo-chan, move your hips a bit.

89
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,220
If you don't, I can't take them off.

90
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,060
No.

91
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,980
We can't move on until they come off.

92
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,060
We don't have to keep going.

93
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,610
Are you sure?

94
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,030
We don't.

95
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,690
Tamamo-chan.

96
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,490
I said we don't.

97
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,820
No...

98
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,620
Musashi-chan, you pervert.

99
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,210
Tamamo-chan, can you spread your legs?

100
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,170
No.

101
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,540
Don't.

102
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,920
That tickles.

103
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,710
No, not there

104
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,630
Wow, it feels weird.

105
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,470
No...

106
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,350
It feels good...

107
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,150
No...

108
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,360
Stop...

109
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,950
Don't lick there.

110
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,030
It's delicious, Tomamo-chan.

111
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,830
Don't tease me.

112
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,340
It feels so good... Musashi-chan...

113
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,510
You're not afraid anymore, are you Tamamo-chan?

114
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,880
No.

115
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,840
Okay, then here I come.

116
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,970
It's in.

117
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,310
A man's... Musashi-chan's...

118
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,520
Good...

119
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,740
Oh my god, it's inside me. Moving in and out.

120
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,910
That's it. It feels good.

121
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,920
It feels good. Really dirty.

122
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,300
I can feel it. Unbelievable.

123
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,400
Musashi-chan, I love it.

124
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,150
It's so good! This is the first time something's
felt this good.  Musashi-chan...

125
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,070
I had no idea it'd feel this good.

126
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,660
Harder, harder.

127
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,670
Harder..

128
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,590
Tamamo-chan, I can't take it anymore.

129
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,090
Musashi-chan, it's okay.  Do it.

130
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,880
Tamamo.

131
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,720
Cum inside me!

132
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,610
What's wrong? Calling me all of a sudden.

133
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,240
Wasn't last night a failure?

134
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,160
Yeah, but I'm sure I saw Musashi-san last night.

135
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,120
What?

136
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:16,550
Really? So it's true that if we pray into this mirror.
we can see the person we want to see.

137
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,470
Yes, but something wrong.

138
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,720
Wrong?

139
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,430
What?!

140
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,510
Onii-chan!

141
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,230
He looks good. But where is this? Our village?

142
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,440
It looks similar but it's not.

143
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,360
There's no way he could return here.

144
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,440
But it looks like it.

145
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,650
That's why I said it's strange.

146
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,200
No way.

147
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,200
What's happen?

148
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,540
This places hasn't changed since I was a child.

149
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,050
That's right, this shrine collapsed.

150
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,800
I often played here.

151
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,961
Who was I playing with?

152
00:12:04,262 --> 00:12:08,076
That's right, probably with Tamamo-chan.

153
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,650
Forgive me Suzaku-san!

154
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,030
Who is Suzaku?

155
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,910
Here too...

156
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,190
Something is wrong.

157
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:04,142
The village I remember was more innocent, sexy, violent
and tidy.

158
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:07,680
What the hell was that? A dead village!

159
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,410
It's snowing. I'll have to hurry back.

160
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,750
Musashi-sama! Musashi-soma!

161
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,090
That voice. I've heard it before.

162
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,590
Snow?

163
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,060
Musashi-chan!

164
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,690
You left without telling me.

165
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,190
Sorry. I was getting a little nostalgic.

166
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,860
It's snowing so let's hurry home.

167
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,990
Musashi-sama! Musashi-sama! Musashi-sama!

168
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,250
It's impossible Yuki.
He can't hear you.

169
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,210
I'm sure he heard me just now.

170
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,540
Musashi-sama! Musashi-sama!

171
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,080
Hurry and get Tengu-sama.

172
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,000
But I've kept this a secret from him.

173
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,960
I hove a bad feeling.

174
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,630
Musashi will be in danger if we don't do anything.

175
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,010
Danger?

176
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,390
We must go.

177
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,140
To help Musashi-sama.

178
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,980
I can't seem to relax.

179
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,770
Onii-chan.

180
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
That girl.

181
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,040
Damn, I can't remember. I feel like
I've forgotten something important.

182
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,540
Damn it. Damn it! Damn it!!

183
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,840
Musashi-chan, is something wrong?

184
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,010
No... I'm probably just thinking too much.

185
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,800
Yeah, that's it. That has to be it.

186
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,560
I can't live if you hate me.

187
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,770
There's no way I can hate you.

188
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,890
But...

189
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,400
That's what he says.

190
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,900
That's true.

191
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,580
Lick me more. Clean me up good.

192
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,460
That bastard!

193
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,090
Onii-chan, that's so mean! Doing it with her!

194
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,720
Please stop.

195
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,560
I can't watch anymore.
I'm going to tell Tengu-sama.

196
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,110
Right there feels great.

197
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,990
So good.

198
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,490
Lick me there.

199
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,960
I'm going to...

200
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,590
Did you enjoy it?

201
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,050
My minds blank.

202
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,230
Hey, Musashi-chan. Could you promise me?

203
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,810
Kiss me here.

204
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,200
Tomamo-chan?

205
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,990
This will be proof of our eternal vow.

206
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,240
Vow?

207
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,910
Quickly.

208
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,160
Okay.

209
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,660
Musashi!

210
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,620
Onii-chan!

211
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,250
You will be mine forever.

212
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,680
Musashi!

213
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,980
W-What's that?

214
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,460
- Musashi!
- Musashi!

215
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,120
Why do you know my name?

216
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,330
Those girls were banished from
our village because of evil acts.

217
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,130
What? Isn't that a play?

218
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,510
Save me!

219
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,340
Stop holding onto him!

220
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,760
They don't seem so evil especially since they're cute.

221
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,850
He said we're cute.

222
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,810
You dumbass. This isn't the time.

223
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,270
Musashi, let's run! They're going to use violence and steal all our things.

224
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,780
Let me get my clothes first.

225
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,280
Forget about that and hurry.

226
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,490
Damn you! Do I look like a barbarian to you?

227
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,570
You do. Like a savage barbarian.

228
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,410
This way!

229
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,700
Hold on.

230
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,660
Wait!

231
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:15,170
This feels like sauna. I didn't know that
there was a cave at that open air bath.

232
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,050
We should be safe now. They
shouldn't be able to follow us this far.

233
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:20,890
Yeah.

234
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,550
I'm so scared.

235
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,060
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

236
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,560
You're so energetic.

237
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,900
Well, I am young.

238
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,320
What now?

239
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,120
Musashi-sama, you're human.

240
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,990
You must not interfer.

241
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,080
You too.

242
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,870
Get away from Musashi or else.

243
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,960
I don't remember you being
able to order me around.

244
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,210
I have no choice.

245
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,180
Tamamo.

246
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,310
You shielded me... why?

247
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,100
Isn't it obvious? We're not strangers anymore.

248
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,020
Musashi-chan..

249
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,650
Musashi-sama, you love her than me.

250
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,030
This is bad.

251
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,410
Musashi-chan, hurry.

252
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,080
No!

253
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,250
I hate to run away but I can't fight against ice.

254
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,590
Why did it get so cold all of a suddenly?

255
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
Tamamo-chan?

256
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,930
I'm at my limit.

257
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,640
My body's too hot. I'm going to melt.

258
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,610
What's wrong with her? No matter how hot
it is would you normally start stripping?

259
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,870
Um, are you all right?
Well, of course you're not.

260
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,040
I'll take you somewhere cool.

261
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,710
No, you can't. Leave me alone.

262
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,630
Don't be nice to me.

263
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,710
What ore you saying? Come on.

264
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,970
Stop.

265
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,430
Musashi-sama.

266
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,640
I can't take it anymore!

267
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,270
I can't hold back any longer.

268
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,730
Fuck me and cool my body down.

269
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,820
If you don't I will melt.

270
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,190
I'm such a bad girl.

271
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,080
I swore that. I would never be with Musashi-sama again.

272
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,790
I don't know what's going on but if she needs my help then...

273
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,630
Sorry, Tamamo-chan.

274
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,590
Musashi-sama, hurry and put it in me.

275
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,440
Musashi-sama, I can feel you in me.

276
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,570
I thought I'd never be able to do this again.

277
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,240
This is like a dream.

278
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:36,370
Musashi-sama... Musashi-sama! I'm so happy that you're fucking me.

279
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,330
Good!

280
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,380
You idiots! What the hell did you do?

281
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,630
I'm sorry.

282
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,090
This mirror doesn't reflect what you are thinking.

283
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,300
What's happened to them then?

284
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,770
I can only imagine the worst.

285
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,060
I can't imagine what terrible things are happening to Musashi.

286
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,070
This feels so good.

287
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,740
Musashi-sama, do you like it?

288
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,750
Harder, fuck me harder.

289
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,340
Musashi-sama.

290
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,270
Musashi-sama, faster.

291
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,940
What is this weird but familiar feeling?

292
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,860
I remember this girl...

293
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,870
Who is she? Who?
Damn it. I can't remember.

294
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,370
I'm cumming.

295
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,920
Musashi!

296
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,720
Con you hear me?

297
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,090
W-Who are you?

298
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,470
Musashi, you aren't in the
village you grew up in.

299
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,640
You are in an imitation of that village.

300
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,190
Who are you? Show yourself.

301
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,032
Musashi-sama, that voice...

302
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,121
Did you hear that too?

303
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,320
Who was that?

304
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,400
No, forget about the voice.

305
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,740
You, who are you?

306
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,120
Don't ask me that. You and I
aren't from the same world.

307
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,290
Then why do you know me?

308
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,700
That is...

309
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,830
Musashi, you mustn't be deceived.
That girl is evil.

310
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,880
You can relax, we caught
her evil companions.

311
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,840
Damnit!

312
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,800
Onii-chan!

313
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,590
Suzaku-chan! Anju-chan!

314
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,810
Hey, who are you?

315
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,980
What are you saying? It's me.

316
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,480
Don't lie to me.

317
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,820
My grandmother has no tail!

318
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,190
Damn...

319
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,820
That dolt.

320
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,910
Musashi, good eyes.

321
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,450
Again.

322
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,540
The truth is she is monster called an Enra.

323
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,750
Enra?

324
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,250
That's right.

325
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:34,300
I am the chief of the Enra Fire village.

326
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,930
Tamamo is my only daughter.

327
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,720
T - T - Tamamno - chan?

328
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,270
Homurabe.
(People who treats fire like a magician)

329
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,190
How can such a cute girl come
from such ugly parents?

330
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,940
I commend you on seeing through our seal.

331
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,990
We shall withdraw today but this
doesn't meant we have given up.

332
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,990
I shall destroy you.

333
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,160
I won't give up Musashi to you.

334
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,830
What was that...

335
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,500
Musashi, try to remember!

336
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,170
Not again.

337
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,050
If you can remember the truth, you
will break the seal on the village.

338
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,420
What do you mean the truth?

339
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,760
Did I completely erase his memory?
Is it impossible for him to remember?

340
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,680
Musashi-san, please remember.

341
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,350
Musashi, did you really forget everything?

342
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,190
Onii-chan, try to remember about me and everyone.

343
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,690
Onii-chan... you mean me?

344
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,110
Onii-chan... you jerk!

345
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,040
Where am I?

346
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,630
What was I...? Anju-chan? Suzaku-san?

347
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,710
And even Mayuki-chan.

348
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,670
Musashi-sama...

349
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,470
Why are you naked?

350
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,720
What's wrong, you two?
Is there something on my face?

351
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,770
Oh right, I don't see Nami-san.

352
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,270
What are you doing?

353
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,360
Ouch!

354
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,610
Hey, let go.

355
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,650
Musashi-san.

356
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:23,240
My seal has broken like that?

357
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,380
You old geezer! Playing around in
my head and erasing my memories!

358
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,300
My head's not a video tape!

359
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,840
Shut up boy.

360
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:44,560
I have to go a meeting of village chiefs to explain about this incident.

361
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,220
So shut up for while.

362
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,180
Meeting of village chiefs?

363
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,230
We need to discuss the Enra.

364
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,190
Take me with you.

365
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,320
What?

366
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,320
It's because your village chief heads
are so hard that this happens.

367
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,820
I feel sorry for these girls.

368
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,580
I'll go and tell them directly.
