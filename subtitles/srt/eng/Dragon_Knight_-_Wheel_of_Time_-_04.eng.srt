1
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,553
There's no point in you dying with us.

2
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,055
What is that supposed to mean?!

3
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,353
If you die, you won't meet Lucifon.

4
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,799
My...

5
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,646
We can't keep up.

6
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:25,382
We're suffering heavy casualties.\NWhat should we do?

7
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,720
Eto, let's make a break for it!

8
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,018
At this rate, we'll be cut\Ndown like animals in a cage.

9
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,830
Finish off everyone but Kakeru!

10
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,265
You may do with the\Nwomen as you wish!

11
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,826
Oh, yeah! Let's finish 'em off!

12
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,242
It's Seil!

13
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,107
Now! Hit them while\Nthey are scattering!

14
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,925
Damn it! Pull back! Pull back!

15
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,738
They took Marlene!

16
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,427
Marlene!

17
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,428
It seems we're quite a\Nbit ahead of the others.

18
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,462
It will probably take them three\Ndays to get here from the valley.

19
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,736
Marlene?

20
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:30,568
Eto, I beg you. Stop\Nthis war with Lucifon.

21
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,912
Why are you saying\Nsomething like that?

22
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,650
If we stop, then what?

23
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:44,589
But at this rate, everyone,\Nyou, Kakeru, Natasha, will die.

24
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,325
You know well that we have\Nfew other choices remaining.

25
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,587
I have a sister that I left\Nbehind in the Underworld.

26
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,804
My older sister Mano; she\Nsacrificed her own body so that

27
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,103
her father would accept\Nher marriage to Lucifon.

28
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,776
She had the black stone removed\Nfrom her womb well aware of

29
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,337
the curse that would\Naccompany such an act.

30
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,209
So you're telling me your sister\Nwas in love with Lucifon?

31
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,954
In the end, my father came\Nto accept the marriage.

32
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:22,651
As the king of the Underworld, no one\Nwould oppose my father's decision.

33
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:27,195
So that's why you came to this\Nworld chasing after Lucifon.

34
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,307
Do you really love Lucifon?

35
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:53,384
Yes, I do. I love Lucifon.

36
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,388
Then why do you ask me to\Nstop our battle against him?

37
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,867
Why did you save me when the

38
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,732
dragons attacked Captain Zum's ship?

39
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:07,701
If you love Lucifon that much,\Nwould you not want to see me die?

40
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,910
Marlene, you are not in\Nlove with Lucifon.

41
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:19,183
How can you say that?!

42
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:25,051
The feelings you have are because you\Nfeel you are competing with your sister

43
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,891
or because you might have\Nrevered Lucifon in some way.

44
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,488
And you believe you\Ncannot go back anymore.

45
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,890
Oh, please stop!

46
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,498
I beg you. Please, please stop.

47
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:48,475
You are free. Why don't\Nyou go to Lucifon?

48
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,151
It would probably be better\Nthat we separated here and now.

49
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,417
Wait!

50
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,923
Please wait. Eto, please stay with me.

51
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,701
I can't!

52
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,367
But I'm in love with you!

53
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:25,151
I recognized this\Nfeeling inside me,

54
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,382
but I am the daughter of King\NMinakkus of the Underworld,

55
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,288
and you are the one from\Nthe bloodlines of the gods.

56
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,827
I knew professing such\Na thing wouldn't...

57
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,163
That's why I...

58
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,527
I didn't want to admit\Nto what I felt inside.

59
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,798
So warm.

60
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:22,202
I... I don't want to\Nmake you suffer any more.

61
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,804
Eto, no matter what\Nhappens from now on,

62
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:32,544
that won't change\Nhow happy I am now.

63
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,823
If this is a dream, I\Ndon't want to wake from it.

64
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,324
Marlene...

65
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,348
{\kf900000}Eto...

66
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:19,657
I can't hold back anymore.\NPlease, come into...

67
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,407
Wait, please don't move yet.

68
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,448
Please stay still\Ninside me for a moment.

69
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,916
I want to feel you inside me.

70
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:49,286
Please... Lie if you must, but\Nplease tell me you love me.

71
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,788
I love you, Marlene.

72
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,497
Oh, why can't the flow\Nof time stop right now?

73
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,285
Eto, please don't forget me.

74
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,765
I won't. Ever...

75
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,232
Eto...

76
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,110
Eto, please go ahead.

77
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,571
Marlene...

78
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,907
Not yet.

79
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,005
Let me be like this\Nfor a moment more.

80
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,317
Marlene...

81
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,180
Eto!

82
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,275
Are you all right, Eto?

83
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,052
Eto?

84
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,262
This is all that's left?

85
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,729
Yeah...

86
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:47,866
I see. But we must move\Non, to defeat Lucifon!

87
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,570
What about Marlene, Eto?

88
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:55,209
Oh, she will come later.

89
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,309
Yes, she will!

90
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,998
This is Reimling Castle?!

91
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,301
Lucifon's in there?

92
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,275
That's right.

93
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:28,773
In honor of those turned to stone\Nand those that fell coming here.

94
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,609
All right, everyone. Let's go.

95
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,895
Seil, aren't you afraid?

96
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,937
Thinking about defeating Lucifon\Nso I can have my daddy back...

97
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,603
Thinking about that helps\Nkeep my legs steady.

98
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,148
You were so nice to come,\Ndear Kakeru.

99
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,284
Where?!

100
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,329
So that's what Lucifon sounds like.

101
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,320
You cheatin' bastard! Show yourself!

102
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,157
Enough with the theatrics.

103
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,068
Come out, Lucifon!

104
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,868
It certainly has been\Nan entertaining time.

105
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,143
I'm a little saddened to\Nthink it will all end now.

106
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,611
Show yourself, Lucifon!

107
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,730
So those insignificant germs\Nare your friends, Kakeru?

108
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,994
You'll find out just how insignificant\Nthey are when we fight.

109
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,237
Is that so? Well...

110
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:05,845
Why don't you ask your friends just\Nhow insignificant they are yourself?

111
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,312
What?!

112
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,452
My body... It's frozen.

113
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,956
Kakeru, it's as if our\Nbodies have turned to stone.

114
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,625
Seil, help me!

115
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,126
It won't budge!

116
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,117
{\kf900000}I can't hold a pen!

117
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,997
Kakeru...

118
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,731
My body won't move either.

119
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,705
What?! What's going on, everyone?!

120
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:37,404
Mayfair! Charon!\NNatasha! Bianca?! Eto?!

121
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,611
Damn it! What the hell\Ndid you do to my friends?!

122
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,914
Is this the end?

123
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:50,916
Oh, dear Kakeru, this is\Nwhere it gets interesting.

124
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,523
He... Help!

125
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:06,805
Ka... Kakeru... Get Marlene...

126
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,307
Eto!

127
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:13,712
{\kf900000}Ka... Kakeru... My mouth... I can't...

128
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,179
Natasha!

129
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,350
I'm sorry, Helen.

130
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,121
Well, what do you think, Kakeru?

131
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,390
It seems your friends were\Ninsignificant germs after all.

132
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,857
Damn you!

133
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,668
What?!

134
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,607
What?!

135
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,336
{\kf900000}We can move again.

136
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,551
Ino!

137
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,142
{\kf900000}Marlene!

138
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,886
Ino, what are you doing here?

139
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,425
Lucifon...

140
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,660
Please don't kill these people!

141
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,188
Ino? It's Marlene, right?

142
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,268
Please, Lucifon...

143
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,499
{\kf900000}Marlene, how do you know Lucifon?!

144
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,432
How did you enter into this world, Ino?

145
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,805
Using the black stone that\Nmy father had...

146
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,247
Is that so?

147
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,080
You chased after me, didn't you?

148
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,022
Lucifon...

149
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:37,058
It's all right, Ino. I should\Nhave given you more attention.

150
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,761
I understand, so why don't you\Ncease countering my magic now.

151
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,238
Ino!

152
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,842
Marlene...

153
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:54,711
Dear Kakeru, this woman's\Nname is not Marlene.

154
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:59,216
She is Ino, daughter of the ruler\Nof the Underworld, King Minakkus.

155
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,480
Tell me. It's a lie, right?

156
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,385
Lucifon, I beg you. Go back.

157
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,186
Back to the Underworld\Nwhere Mano awaits you!

158
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,168
Ino, are you siding with the humans?\NYou couldn't possibly do that.

159
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:20,039
I... I...

160
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,769
Why, that would be preposterous,\Nwouldn't it?

161
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,040
Lucifon, I...

162
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:32,908
My adorable Ino. Come\Nto my side, child.

163
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,920
You can't do that, Marlene!

164
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:42,351
What is it, Ino? Did you not enter\Nthis world hoping to be loved by me?

165
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:47,692
You... You could not bring\Nyourself to love me.

166
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:52,035
Nor can I love you.

167
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:57,732
I am in love with Eto.

168
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,278
Marlene!

169
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,615
I am Eto!

170
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,020
Why, he's nothing but a human!

171
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:14,122
Ino, how could a woman of the\NUnderworld love a human male?

172
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:19,031
Lucifon, you'll most likely\Nnever learn that answer

173
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,797
no matter how many times\Nyou are reincarnated.

174
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:28,165
Rubbish. Come, Ino. Come to my side.

175
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:35,369
I will not! I now know how wrong I\Nwas before.

176
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:44,678
Ino! Oh, to think how saddened\NKing Minakkus will be to hear this!

177
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,484
The curse that has enveloped your\Nsister will never be lifted!

178
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:54,095
And you tell me to use the stone\Nto go back to the Underworld?!

179
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,373
Lucifon...

180
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,308
It would take little to\Nhave you all killed.

181
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:16,155
I would die for the\Nsake of Eto. Willingly!

182
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,622
Enough!

183
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,749
Souls of my servants without bodies,

184
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,490
exact your wrath, and feast upon\Nthe bodies of the bugs before me!

185
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,468
Listen up! This is the last battle!

186
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,437
Once we defeat him, peace\Nwill come back to the world!

187
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,599
Ready, Natasha?! Lucifon!

188
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,474
Aeolus Blade!

189
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,612
Lucifon!

190
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,728
Do you wish that I unleash\Nmy true powers?!

191
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,236
Oh, no!

192
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,941
I had so many ideas in mind of how\Nto entertain you, dear Kakeru.

193
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:18,349
But I'll have to make you pay\Nfor scarring me like this.

194
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,119
You will pay slowly.

195
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,586
Kakeru!

196
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,884
And oh so painfully.

197
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,520
You cheatin' bastard, Lucifon!

198
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,589
Come out, I know\Nyou're hiding here!

199
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,803
Eto!

200
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,538
You...

201
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,272
Let Marlene go, Lucifon.

202
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,914
Ino, seems you've beguiled\Nthese two quite thoroughly.

203
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,542
I have not beguiled them.

204
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,553
Only those of the Underworld and\Nthose from the bloodline of the gods

205
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,020
can enter this space.

206
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,683
Then... Who are you?

207
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:40,756
Lucifon, it seems there are\Nthings even you do not know.

208
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,395
Who are you? Who?!

209
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,277
Damn you...

210
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,916
You runt!

211
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,584
Eto, watch out!

212
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,298
Now, Kakeru!

213
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,904
It all ends now, Lucifon.

214
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,374
You?!

215
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:44,722
Impossible! How could I... I...

216
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,682
My God!

217
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,818
{\i1} {\i}\NEto...

218
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,919
{\kf900000}Eto!

219
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:43,221
Sir Kakeru, Sir Eto!\NWe have persevered!

220
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,723
Eto!

221
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,588
{\kf900000}How is your injury?

222
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,554
Now I can go back to the\Nbastion, where my grandpa is!

223
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,769
Eto...

224
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:13,516
Wait, Eto! Take me.\NPlease take me with you.

225
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,012
Eto? Are you going away now?

226
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,090
Eto...

227
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,300
You've grown big\Nand strong, Kakeru.

228
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,669
I'm proud of how you\Ndefeated Lucifon.

229
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:35,868
It's all thanks to you, Eto. I was only\Nable to fight this long thanks to you.

230
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,743
So, Eto, where are you\Ngoing? I'll go with you.

231
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,782
Kakeru!

232
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,620
Kakeru, it's time we part ways.

233
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,592
Daddy?

234
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,725
Do I look like Dad?

235
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:05,663
You look like Dad when\Nhe was young. But why?

236
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,439
I am...

237
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,431
No! You mustn't! Please don't say it!

238
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:21,584
I am Kakeru.

239
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,748
But you're Eto, right?

240
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:30,189
Kakeru, I don't have\Nmuch more time left.

241
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,494
Kakeru, your body...

242
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:38,464
You protect the peace of\Nthis world from now on.

243
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,602
You must not let it slip into\Nthe hands of the Underworld.

244
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:45,210
Wait! Where are you\Ngoing? Take me with you!

245
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,407
I... I am returning\Nto where I belong.

246
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:55,086
Make sure to be more\Nkind to Natasha.

247
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,722
Hey, wait a minute. What's\Nthat supposed to mean?

248
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,783
Seil, please help out Kakeru\Nfrom now on as well.

249
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,322
To think, Sir Eto was Sir Kakeru...

250
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:10,735
Natasha knows all about\Nthis. Good day, Charon.

251
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:17,106
Wait, Eto... Will you... Will you\Nbe my husband? Please?

252
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:24,215
Bianca, make me proud by becoming\Nan exalted princess of Ronboni.

253
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,682
Eto...

254
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:29,276
Mayfair, I am certain Claris is fine.

255
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,782
Combine your strengths and\Nrebuild the village of Trianon.

256
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:39,289
But I was hoping to invite\Nyou to our village, Eto.

257
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:45,664
Natasha, take care of Kakeru.

258
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,403
I'll never forget you.

259
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,108
And I will never\Nforget you as well.

260
00:26:53,511 --> 00:27:00,713
Take care, everybody. I'm so\Nglad I was able to meet you all.

261
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,626
Eto...

262
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,663
Marlene...

263
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:21,136
No, please, don't go. Please.\NDon't leave me behind.

264
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,407
Marlene...

265
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,651
Goodbye, Marlene...

266
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,931
