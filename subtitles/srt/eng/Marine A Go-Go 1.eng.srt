1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:03,759
Please show me the
future in a hologram.

2
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:16,573
I'm in love with you more than ever.

3
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:32,497
Marine A Go Go!

4
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:40,797
When I get close to you,
I get goosebumps.

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,945
Because you are my destiny.

6
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:52,444
When I touch the rainbow,
my heart beats faster.

7
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:58,317
Because you are so real to me.

8
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:02,685
Miracle, Miracle!

9
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:09,993
I know things you don't know.

10
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:18,708
Maybe because I was born in this
world, or maybe because I'm an angel.

11
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,874
I'm filled with love.

12
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:30,386
Maybe because I just want to
kiss you right here, right now.

13
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,094
Please kiss me for
a brighter tomorrow!

14
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,507
Location: 30 degrees right at 12
o'clock, vertical angle: Minus 14.

15
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:53,805
Roger!

16
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,414
Distance, 350.

17
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,345
Target locked on!

18
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,450
Start auto scan!

19
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,383
Are you sure she is the one?

20
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,289
No need to worry, Pon...

21
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,258
Look!

22
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,421
Her manner is so lady-like,
it almost seems unnecessary.

23
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,692
She is completely sheltered from
all the burdens of the world.

24
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,395
I am certain that her
brain was developed under...

25
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:21,133
...very pure circumstances, created with
"naive and not-so-bright brain cells."

26
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,105
And to prove my theory...

27
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,110
...look at those well-developed,
stress-free, gigantic boobs!

28
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:30,512
And those curvy hips, which
mercilessly stab at a man's heart!

29
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,980
She is the perfect candidate!
Born to please men!

30
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:38,223
Hmm, you might be onto something...

31
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,456
That's right, and capturing
her would take us...

32
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,188
...one step closer to
success in our project!

33
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,623
Collecting frozen semen?

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,732
Yes.

35
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,894
We will collect prime
semen from men with...

36
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,132
...strong sexual energy
from all over Japan.

37
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,603
To prepare for our brighter future!

38
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,304
I see. And you want me
to approve of this plan?

39
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,148
Yes. And if you could...

40
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,052
...we'd like to keep it secret.

41
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,352
I-I understand...

42
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,960
I will take care of the ministers.

43
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,223
Thank you very much.

44
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:25,798
If we collect prime semen and
freeze it to preserve it...

45
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:31,004
...we can later use the
semen to procreate.

46
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,886
Also, we will enhance the genitals
of the semen's owners...

47
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:48,723
...so that they can go
spread their semen all over Japan!

48
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,565
I've been planning
this for a long time...

49
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,663
I call it the "Preservation of Japan!"

50
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,633
The time of young and healthy
Japanese men will return...

51
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,704
And just how do you plan to do it?

52
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,344
I, Narumi Narutaki, have
everything planed out.

53
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:16,580
We have already selected a
candidate for this project.

54
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,358
She is a woman of exceptional talent!

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,831
Marine! It's your turn to take
care of the school bunny tomorrow.

56
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,332
Don't forget, okay?

57
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,399
Of course I won't.

58
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,130
I learned a valuable
lesson from the last time.

59
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,302
I will do whatever it takes to
take care of the bunny this time!

60
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,280
You don't have to do anything special.

61
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,373
Just use your common sense, okay?

62
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,344
Common sense?

63
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:51,147
Well, don't feed it a piece of
cake like you did last time.

64
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,588
But when I saw that cute little
bunny, I just couldn't help it...

65
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,129
You couldn't help it?

66
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,633
But you should know that
cake can make a bunny sick.

67
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,065
That's common sense.

68
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:09,631
I love cake, so I thought
the bunny would love it too...

69
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,540
I mean, who wouldn't
love such delicious cake?

70
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,537
Everybody doesn't think like you.

71
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,741
You're such a dummy.

72
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:18,976
Yes? Did you say something?

73
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,451
Um, nothing.

74
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:27,215
Well, my car is waiting for me.
I'll see you tomorrow, Marine!

75
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,453
See you tomorrow!

76
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,588
She's dumber than I expected...

77
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,461
Okay, let us carry out our plan.

78
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,398
Roger!

79
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,838
My goodness!

80
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,569
Um, hello?

81
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,308
Water... I want some water...

82
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,185
Oh my! This pink turtle is speaking!

83
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,290
But how? How can a turtle speak?

84
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,488
It's not that surprising.

85
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,494
The turtle from Grimm's
Fairy Tales spoke too, didn't he?

86
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,755
Oh, you're right.

87
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,424
I'm sorry, Mr. Turtle.

88
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:13,096
I've never met a turtle
who could speak before.

89
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,263
I'm sorry if I've offended you.

90
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,367
W-Water...

91
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,468
There you go.

92
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:23,673
Well I was afraid water would
be bland, so I made you some tea.

93
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,647
Please, enjoy.

94
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,418
How is it?

95
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,618
You seemed exhausted, so I
added a secret ingredient...

96
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,830
I used extract of snapping turtle.

97
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,593
Oh my goodness!

98
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,359
Let me bring you a new cup.

99
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,525
No, that's all right!

100
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,005
I want to thank you
for the delicious tea...

101
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,532
I want to give you this...

102
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,207
Oh my...

103
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,438
But I cannot accept
such an expensive gift.

104
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:59,516
My mother told me not to accept gifts
from strangers nor eat food off the
street.

105
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,075
Uh-uh.

106
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,982
That's not how this works...

107
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:10,829
See, you helped me, so now you're
obligated to accept this gift from me.

108
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,428
It's been said since ancient times...

109
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,001
..."he who rejects gifts will
be kicked to death by a horse."

110
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,069
Never heard that?

111
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,995
No, I've never heard that before.

112
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,101
Cut the crap!

113
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,235
Dying from being kicked by a horse
is a common fate in human history.

114
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:31,709
It must be true if you say so. After
all, turtles have such a long life span...

115
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,654
All right.

116
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,190
I will accept the ring.

117
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,055
But this ring is a little small...

118
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,658
gotcha.

119
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,760
The ring is...

120
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,235
The ring is moving on its own!

121
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,703
W-What's going on?

122
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,271
Who are you?

123
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:07,116
I am the greatest scientific
genius of the 20th century.

124
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,881
He's that creepy mad scientist
from the mansion next to the school!

125
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,288
I am Professor Narumi Narutaki!

126
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,116
W-What am I going to do?

127
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,891
The teachers told us to always
stay at least 10 meters away...

128
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,326
...but he's already 3 meters away...

129
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,533
I'm a lot closer than you think...

130
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,334
As a matter of fact, you've
already fallen into my hands!

131
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,770
I'll tell you why, Marine Nonohara!

132
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:37,309
The ring you put on is my
newest and greatest invention...

133
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,877
I call it "the Cursed Ring"

134
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,682
What do you mean, it's cursed?

135
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,288
It's a very pretty ring.

136
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,432
My goodness!

137
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,370
W-What's going on?

138
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,114
The "Flute of Naru"!

139
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:16,279
By playing this flute, I can turn the
owner of the ring into a "servant of
men."

140
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,224
I'm a genius, aren't I?

141
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,723
But...

142
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,955
Wait, this costume...

143
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,586
I can't take it off!

144
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,495
The costume can only
be taken off by men.

145
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,998
You should be honored.

146
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,898
It's made with the best materials...

147
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,767
...and designed to capture men's hearts.

148
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,637
We had the best cosplay
store make this costume.

149
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,072
I am a pure genius!

150
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,541
I beg of you. Please take this ring off.

151
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,215
No can do!

152
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,786
Even I cannot take the ring off...

153
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:51,014
But there's one way to take it off...

154
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,215
Oh please! You must tell me how!

155
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,957
Fine, I will tell you...

156
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:05,394
You must sexually serve men
and collect semen from 100 men!

157
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:10,835
Why?

158
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,138
Why do I deserve this?

159
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,016
Now you've got no choice...

160
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,412
I'd say that victory is already ours.

161
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,614
How long are you going
to sit there like that?

162
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:29,388
If you don't do anything, you'll
stay in that naughty costume forever.

163
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,356
I bet people will talk about you.

164
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,364
All I need is play this flute...

165
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,130
Then whether you're in a train...

166
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,570
...or in a bathroom...

167
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,972
...or even when you're
bathing in a hot spring...

168
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:53,451
...you will become a sex
slave in an instant!

169
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,411
How horrible!

170
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,383
I pity you, Marine.

171
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,458
Soon, the only place you'll
be welcome on Earth will be...

172
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,552
...anime cons
full of uncirc\umcised nerds...

173
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,565
...or shady lounges
in the red light district.

174
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,027
What have I done to deserve this?

175
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:17,708
Is this because I made the bunny
sick? Is that why God is punishing me?

176
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,911
But still this is just too cruel!

177
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,608
I even saved that pink turtle earlier...

178
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,383
Who are you calling a turtle?

179
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,580
You!

180
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,019
Ow!

181
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,557
Just open your eyes and
look closely, you dummy!

182
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,254
I hate when someone calls me a turtle!

183
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,195
But you used the anecdote about the
turtle from Grimm's Fairy Tales...

184
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,662
Shut up!

185
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:47,101
I never said that I was a turtle.

186
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,864
I'm no turtle.

187
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,136
I am a snapping turtle!

188
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:59,112
So you lied to me?

189
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,550
You're one dumb girl.

190
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,579
Let me introduce you!

191
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,023
He is my great assistant,
and also my best invention...

192
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,329
Model Number: Bio-animaloid SM 01...

193
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,228
...Snapping Turtle Semen
Collecting Robot, "P-O-N"...

194
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,062
I call him "Pon"!

195
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:16,998
That's right!

196
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,965
B-But...

197
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,472
Maybe it's beginning to dawn on you,
but...

198
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,603
Everything was...

199
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,678
...an act just to trick you!

200
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,006
So, what do you say now?

201
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,639
Are you going to collect semen for us?

202
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,582
You want to take the
ring off, don't you?

203
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,555
Huh? What's gonna be?

204
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:38,812
Huh?

205
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,988
Huh? Huh?

206
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,428
Huh?

207
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,163
No!

208
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,778
Akira Fuse!

209
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,281
Number 29 on Narutaki's "Men
to Collect Semen from" list...

210
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:15,587
Age 21, blood type: RH+A, hobby:
Collecting photos of cosplayers...

211
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:21,260
Times you were turned
down by girls: 14.

212
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:25,971
87% of them gave you
"Let's just be friends."

213
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,629
What?

214
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,704
You failed the college entrance exams...

215
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,438
...and you've been going to a
cram school for three years.

216
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,740
W-Who the hell are you?

217
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,916
Do you have any hope for the future?

218
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,280
Don't you want the energy to go forth?

219
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,022
I could take you to heaven for no charge
during this special promotional period!

220
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:50,890
What do you say?

221
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,759
Is this some kind of solicitation
for illegal sexual activities?

222
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,299
Just leave me alone...

223
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,262
Because I have to study...

224
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,066
I don't have time to talk to you.

225
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,241
Besides, I'm a...

226
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,744
I'm a...

227
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,046
Listen Marine...

228
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,955
You need training first.

229
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:25,320
I've arranged an easy target for
you since this is your first time...

230
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:30,395
Don't worry, he's just a meek student.

231
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,599
But don't let your guard down.

232
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,773
He's been studying day and night,
his stress level is very high...

233
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,078
You cannot predict what
he'll do when he snaps.

234
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,713
But we have no time to worry.

235
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,544
You have to master many
different techniques to...

236
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,176
...endure the trials that await you!

237
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,563
What took you so long, Narutaki?

238
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,938
We're all ready.

239
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,406
So, that's the girl...

240
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,946
Let me introduce you,
Doctor Marilyn!

241
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,920
This is an exceptionally talented girl...

242
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,583
...l've picked from many
other candidates... Marine Nonohara!

243
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,022
C-Cute...

244
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,330
I see, she does appear
to have some potential...

245
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:41,336
Well, okay then. Let's
see what she's got.

246
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,635
All right. This is your
first assignment, Marine!

247
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:50,804
Use that sexy body of yours to
brighten this sad man's dark future!

248
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,883
Go Marine! Suck out young
and healthy semen from him!

249
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,756
No!

250
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,522
I cannot do such a
thing! Please, have mercy!

251
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,494
My Flute of Naru can read
the mind of the target...

252
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:13,633
...and change your costume to
the one the target most desires.

253
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:20,610
Do I have to change the costume again?

254
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,715
Oh no!

255
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,811
What's happening?

256
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,712
It's changing again?

257
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,151
W-What's going on?

258
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,486
Again?

259
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,162
Oh no!

260
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:44,229
What the hell is this? Her costume
keeps changing and changing...

261
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,130
Oh! I got it!

262
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,936
He has a cosplay fetish!

263
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,404
So his mind cannot
decide on one costume!

264
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:59,015
So his desire to make her
dress in different costumes is...

265
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,511
...causing this phenomenon...

266
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,511
That's right!

267
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,489
Please, someone stop this!

268
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,654
Are you going to stop it?

269
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,423
Well, it is pretty entertaining, but...

270
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,166
...we have to move on...

271
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,870
Let me choose the costume then.

272
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,413
F-Finally it's stopped...

273
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,049
We've got no time to waste!

274
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,844
What are you doing?

275
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,848
Come one, move your hips more!

276
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,959
Please stop it!

277
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,924
This is so embarrassing!

278
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,291
Panties!

279
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,666
Please don't take them off!

280
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,704
If you want me stop, then you
better serve this man on your own.

281
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,544
Yes! I'll do whatever you say!

282
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,080
I will serve him!

283
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,353
All right!

284
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,979
Doctor Marilyn, shall we
prepare for the lecture?

285
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:29,100
Th-This is the manhood itself?

286
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,109
I never thought it would be so big...

287
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,542
First, use your hands to please him.

288
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,815
Oh my goodness, it's throbbing.

289
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:46,550
And it's hard, and twitching too.

290
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,923
So this is what a man is...

291
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,096
Ew!

292
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,102
What's this?

293
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:07,703
Something sticky is coming
out from the tip of it!

294
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,245
Don't get so excited,
it's just pre-come.

295
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,780
And now, give him a blow job.

296
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:20,283
Um, excuse me, but what is a blow job?

297
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,993
You put it into your mouth and suck it.

298
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,688
What? Into my mouth?

299
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,197
But...

300
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,165
Oh no! Why me!

301
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,670
Please help me Mother!

302
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,377
Just give it up and do it already!

303
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,908
This isn't too bad either...

304
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,320
Please forgive me!

305
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,886
Stop whining, Marine!

306
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:55,050
You'll never collect the semen of a
hundred men if you keep acting like that!

307
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,486
You'll never be a woman
of love and service.

308
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,727
It's showtime!

309
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,264
Now Marine...

310
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:16,374
Doctor Marilyn and I will show
you everything you need to learn!

311
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,842
Just watch very closely!

312
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,245
Lesson one!

313
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,127
I want you to shoot a load of come...

314
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,110
Th-that's naughty!

315
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,713
That's naughty!

316
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,119
Lesson two!

317
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,120
Please, give it to me...

318
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,528
I want you to come on my face.

319
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:11,262
I want your thick love juice...

320
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:17,532
Shoot it all over my face!

321
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,678
Narutaki!

322
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,508
I want it...

323
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,953
Cover me with your come.

324
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,632
So much milk comes out of a man...

325
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,729
Is that...

326
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,064
Is that "ejaculation"?

327
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,072
Thick as usual...

328
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,039
Hmm... yummy.

329
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,012
Lesson Three!

330
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,179
Yes!

331
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,150
I can feel it deep inside me!

332
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,221
It's going in deep!

333
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,424
I'm going crazy!

334
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,665
Harder! Harder!

335
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,664
Don't tease me!

336
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,668
Please give it to me!

337
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,461
That's filthy!

338
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:21,867
That's filthy!

339
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,275
I'm coming!

340
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,815
This is the end of the lecture!

341
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,750
Well then Marine...

342
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,811
We wish you the best!

343
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,424
No!

344
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,292
No! Don't put it in there!

345
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,493
I'll never get married!

346
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,605
I can't believe it!

347
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,905
My first time shouldn't be like this...

348
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,913
This Chinese dress reminds me
of Miss Mirei, who I had a crush on...

349
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,977
Miss Mirei!

350
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,646
Miss Mirei!

351
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,023
Hey, Narutaki.

352
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,787
You wanna go for one more round?

353
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,633
I'm sure you still have
plenty of energy left...

354
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,669
Please, not now!

355
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:29,604
Japan's future depends on this training!

356
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,332
Idiot!

357
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:35,071
If he keeps doing this, my
body won't last too long...

358
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,105
I'm sorry.

359
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,546
We don't have to do this.

360
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,646
It's sad. Really.

361
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,255
It takes forever for me to come...

362
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,450
That's why all my girlfriends dumped
me...

363
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,219
Maybe I'll never be
able to come having sex...

364
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,060
Damn it!

365
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,030
Damn it!

366
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,301
What a poor man...

367
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:05,810
You must've gone through a lot...

368
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,538
Don't worry!

369
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,948
I promise I will make you come!

370
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:17,145
We can do this together,
okay? Mr. Student!

371
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,822
Good job, Marine!

372
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,989
I've been waiting for you to say that!

373
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,132
Professor!

374
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,960
"Love and Serve" mode, activated!

375
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,169
Now is the time to achieve your mission!

376
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,229
My mission?

377
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,336
Destined to live a cursed fate...

378
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,812
The goal is one hundred ejaculations!

379
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,945
I'm Marine! I'm here to love and serve!

380
00:24:53,492 --> 00:25:00,694
For the bright future of
Japan, I shall take your semen!

381
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,801
<i> </i>
You're so great, Marine!

382
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:03,134
He's already naked.
You're so great, Marine!

383
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:03,235
He's already naked.
<i> </i>

384
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,169
He's already naked.
You're better than any cosplay gals!

385
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,403
This is the best blow job I've ever had!

386
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,537
Oh, Marine...

387
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,343
I can't believe this is your first time.

388
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,420
Marine, are you sure?

389
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,059
My virginity may have
been taken away earlier...

390
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,424
...but now I will give
you my true virginity.

391
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,512
I'll put it in, Marine.

392
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,270
Yes...

393
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,297
Oh Marine!

394
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,639
I'm going to come...

395
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,773
I'm really going to come, Marine!

396
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,532
Thank you so much, Marine.

397
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,569
I'm glad that you finally came.

398
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,907
Congratulations!

399
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,251
I came, because of you.

400
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,028
Mission accomplished!

401
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,688
No way...

402
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,210
Congratulations on your first
successful mission, Marine.

403
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:04,545
But I cannot get married anymore...

404
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:09,420
No need to worry! Pon has
a semen collection function.

405
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,089
By shrinking myself to microscopic
size...

406
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,388
...I can become one
with your you-know-what.

407
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,592
What?

408
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,660
So as long as Pon is inside
you, your virginity is protected.

409
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,462
Then I'm still...

410
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,496
You don't have to worry
about your wedding night.

411
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:28,731
Professor...

412
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,333
You are one step closer
to taking that ring off.

413
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,846
There are only 99 men left to have sex
with!

414
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,281
It seems like a hopelessly long way...

415
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,517
Life is tough. You just
have to work harder!

416
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,651
You're right. I have to work harder.

417
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,461
That's the only way for me...

418
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,890
That's right! Atta girl!

419
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,297
A bright future awaits you!

420
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,503
Yes! I'll do my best!

421
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:32,434
I risk my life to save the future.

422
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:40,907
I'm alone, praying
to the stars above again.

423
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:49,085
I care about you so much.

424
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:57,160
Why can't you see my love for you?

425
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,165
My love will never be true...
<i> </i>

426
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,996
My love will never be true...
Time just passes...

427
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,102
...if I deny the future.
<i> </i>

428
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,127
...if I deny the future.
...as I cling to the past.

429
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:13,234
But that is not why we live.

430
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:21,616
Always, sacrifice your feelings...

431
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,847
Turn sorrow into strength...

432
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:32,626
People may have doubts, but still...

433
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:37,766
They live for tomorrow...

434
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,962
They live for their hopes...

435
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,876
...because they have
love inside themselves.

436
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:52,073
Everything is for love.
