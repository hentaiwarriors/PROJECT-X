1
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:50,077
Welcome back, Lord Estilgar.

2
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,056
How go the arrangements?

3
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,596
Quite well, sir. At this rate,
we'll be done in 3 days.

4
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,632
Oh, so she meets expectations, Garius?

5
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,532
I believe she's a rare find, sir.

6
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,838
I'm looking forward to this.

7
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,371
Yes, endure. Stand up to it.

8
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,000
Endure it until lust
controls you completely...

9
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,909
...then you will be a sex slave!

10
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,984
It was like a nightmare.

11
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,323
It went on unceasingly
for hours. A nightmare.

12
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,604
They shall appear in the humblest of forms.

13
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:22,563
Superior to man or woman,
their advent in this world...

14
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,302
...will herald the defeat of all the evil ones...

15
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,172
...and bring shining prosperity to all!

16
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:41,623
SLAVE WARRIOR MAYA

17
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,202
You there, wait!

18
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:53,663
Me?

19
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:59,973
Hmm... I sense an extraordinary
destiny within you.

20
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,904
I'll read your fortune for you.

21
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,109
Sorry, but I don't have any money.

22
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,385
Compensation is unnecessary.
Now come closer.

23
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,024
Now, the ball. Look into the crystal ball.

24
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,025
Clouds... What happened to me?

25
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,068
M-M-Monsters!

26
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,371
No! Stay back! No!

27
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,175
You are foreigner, Miss?

28
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,346
Those are some really wild
clothes you're wearing.

29
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,723
Wh- What are you things?! Where am I?

30
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,460
Why do you look so weird?!

31
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,168
No way...

32
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,609
You wanna talk about it, Miss?

33
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,718
My name's Maya Mizutani.

34
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,679
My, you have a really wild name, too.

35
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:52,589
Oh, yes. My name's Heckle.
And my friend here...

36
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,187
Jaekel, Miss.

37
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,587
So, Miss Maya, tell us about yourself.

38
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,094
Um, well, I live in Seitatani,
Tokyo and I'm a freshman...

39
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,999
...at St. Canary University.

40
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,635
The school's about 20
minutes from Shibuya...

41
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,296
...by the east rail line, so it's a little far...

42
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,271
...but there's the CD store
and the pachinko parlor...

43
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,809
...that I like in front of the station.

44
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,707
I live with my mom and dad
and our dog, Pusuke, and...

45
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:22,916
Okay, I got it. Miss, you're from
the other world, aren't you?

46
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,646
Other world...?

47
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:30,084
This is Valserius galaxy, star
system Goodwin, planet Estorida.

48
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,897
You don't know, do you?
The sorcerers do this.

49
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:34,795
Sorcerers?

50
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:35,458
Exactly.

51
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:39,334
It's not that rare for them to
forcibly bring people here.

52
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,870
Oh, no... Then what will I do?

53
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,204
What'll we do, Heckle?

54
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,437
What do you think? There's only
one thing to do when this happens.

55
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,181
Yeah, there's no escape.

56
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,079
Anyway, what you do is...

57
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,449
Um...

58
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,350
Oh, uh, no worries, Miss Maya!

59
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,255
Yeah, yeah! We know a
way to get you home.

60
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:04,695
Really?!

61
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:08,964
But we're businessmen, so we
can't just tell you how for nothing.

62
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,603
Um, what should I do?

63
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,340
First, could you take off all your clothes?

64
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:21,409
No way! No way! I couldn't do that!

65
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,074
Let's go, Jaekel.

66
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,713
See you later.

67
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,986
All right, I'll take them off.

68
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,426
Will this do?

69
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,204
Still got some on.

70
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:45,471
Yeah, ditch the other things.
Still got some on.

71
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,938
Yeah, ditch the other things.

72
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,001
No way!

73
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,469
Let's go, Jaekel.

74
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,835
Right with you.

75
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,035
All right! I'm desperate.

76
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,838
It would be for some lizards, too...

77
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,822
Satisfied?

78
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,897
Hey, cut it out! That hurts!

79
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,499
What's going on?! What's the big idea?!

80
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:28,005
Don't talk. A naked woman in
the mountains isn't human.

81
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,547
She's an animal!

82
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,851
Now that you've taken off your
clothes, you're just an animal.

83
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,451
You live or die on our say-so.

84
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,316
Oh, no...

85
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,085
No!

86
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,966
Get one to really get some!

87
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,871
And now, the final bargains for today!

88
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,536
Step right up, folks! We've got
a lovely woman for you today.

89
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,975
First cleaned up for you in the city of Maar!

90
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,118
She was born an aristocrat...

91
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,710
...but, sadly, caught in the flames of war.

92
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,617
She lost her home, her family!

93
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,584
Forced to live alone in the outback!

94
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,588
Her virginity is intact!

95
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,361
Innocent! Upright! Beautiful!

96
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,295
Her chastity developed over several years!

97
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,058
And, with all the things she's seen...

98
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,156
...she is a woman of many contradictions!

99
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,861
With a body as passionate as hers...

100
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,062
...she isn't even guilty of pleasuring herself.

101
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,865
Now, then, everyone. For this virgin...

102
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,907
...let's start hearing the bids!

103
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,533
Will you pull out that
wonderful money of yours...

104
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,644
...and give some of it for her?

105
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,242
Okay, let's start the bidding at 200!

106
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,248
Give it a try! What's to lose?

107
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,245
203!
206!

108
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,316
206!
I'll see your bid!

109
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,216
And there's one more feature to show them.

110
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:55,059
220! 250!
230!

111
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,270
300!
360!

112
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:00,996
Five million!

113
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,833
Five million.

114
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:10,074
F- Five million?! Anyone
else want to see that bid?!

115
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:23,417
W- Well, then, sold to Lord
Estilgar for five million!

116
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,891
She got picked by one of the elite.

117
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,528
No! No, stop it!

118
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:40,845
I see... The gloss of your skin
shows you really are a virgin.

119
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,714
Not there! It hurts!

120
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,681
Oh, is this what it is to be a virgin?

121
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,617
You've never even pleasured yourself.

122
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:54,253
My God, you'll be amazing as a sex slave.

123
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,227
Please! Please don't hurt me! Please!

124
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,964
What are you saying?
With your wet little hole...

125
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,339
Garius, I leave this to you.

126
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,572
As you wish.

127
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,845
And, to become the sex
slave they wanted...

128
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,446
...my body gradually began
to change Into a sex fiend's.

129
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,081
Maya! Maya!

130
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,790
We came for the other half
of your slave auction price.

131
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,826
We heard you were down
here and came to see you.

132
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,095
Man, you've really got it rough!

133
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,372
And whose fault do you think that is?!

134
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,200
Please, forgive us.

135
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,002
Yeah, forgive us.

136
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,469
It's your fault that I... I...!

137
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,581
Wow, you really pack it in.

138
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,547
Yeah, that's incredible.

139
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,479
No, please! Don't move it!

140
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,977
Miss Maya?

141
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,687
You don't seem to want us down here.

142
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,690
If that's the case, then...

143
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,495
...we're outta here!

144
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,561
Wait! I know something you want to hear!

145
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,102
Something that'll make you money!

146
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,565
What, are you gonna try to
trick us so we can save you?

147
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:19,241
It's true! I saw where this
castle's treasure room is.

148
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,445
The treasure room?!

149
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,410
Yeah. You see that lever over there?

150
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,414
If you pull it, it'll open the
door to the treasure room.

151
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,115
What'll we do, Heckle?

152
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,916
Hmm... We may never
have this chance again.

153
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,593
Right. If you don't, you'll regret
it for the rest of your lives.

154
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,127
True, but I still think you're trying to trick us.

155
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,299
You really did trick us!

156
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,834
Now we're even.

157
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,172
W-W-What'll we do? If they find
out, there'll be hell to pay!

158
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,145
We've got no choice! We'll
have to take Maya and run!

159
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,650
Come on, Maya! Let's go!

160
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,554
Something wrong, Maya?

161
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:01,954
It won't come out! It's stuck!
Something wrong, Maya?

162
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,616
It won't come out! It's stuck!

163
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,488
You're a lot of trouble, you know that?

164
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,556
An escape! A slave's escaped!

165
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,296
Maya, it's okay now.

166
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,071
Wait!

167
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,073
What's wrong?

168
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,139
My... My tail...

169
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,542
Tail? Oh, yeah. Hey, that
looks pretty funny...

170
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,741
This is no time to laugh, you idiot!

171
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:35,053
Forget me, I give up. You
two escape by yourselves.

172
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,455
Heckle, is there something
weird about this room?

173
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,690
I don't see anything.

174
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,419
Just take your glasses off!

175
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,890
Wha... What the hell?!

176
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,597
Heckle, where are we?

177
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,230
I don't know...

178
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,941
Maya! Warrior Maya!

179
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,179
Who's there? Who are you?

180
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,679
Maya? What's going on?

181
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,618
Maya!

182
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,960
Heckle, what was...?!

183
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,493
Who the hell are you?!

184
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,695
Maya! Listen to me, Maya!

185
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:25,436
Who is it?

186
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,563
Who's calling to me?

187
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,098
Take the sword, Maya!

188
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,808
Take the sword and smash them!

189
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,802
Smash evil!

190
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,914
Smash Zotos' ambitions!

191
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,048
This is it!

192
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,620
We're going to die!

193
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,418
What the hell...?!

194
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,141
Could that sword be...?!

195
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,753
That... That's impossible!

196
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,256
This planet is where the
prophecized one appeared?

197
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,963
Yes, Lord Zeon. We will
Be entering orbit shortly.

198
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,295
Estorida, third planet of
the Goodwin star system.

199
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,236
But I don't believe it.

200
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,573
A Druid warrior on a frontier world like this...

201
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,002
I heard you were born on the
frontier as well, Lord Zeon.

202
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,245
Lady Miran.

203
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,672
I believe that's what planet Marina is.

204
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,087
Good Heavens... But, for a holy warrior...

205
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,589
A legendary Druid warrior
to have appeared here.

206
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,522
Do you doubt the god Romus, Lord Zeon?

207
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,254
Forgive me. So long as
I can, I will serve Him.

208
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,366
Very well. To be honest, I, too,
used to doubt the legend.

209
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,192
Until just now...

210
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,434
Lady Miran...

211
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:11,173
I felt it. I felt the warrior's awakening.

212
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,909
What? The awakening?!

213
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,748
Yes, Lord Glassmeyer. Without a doubt.

214
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,416
It was definitely the legendary warrior!

215
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:26,683
Estilgar, it seems I was
wrong to entrust you...

216
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,656
...with maintaining the seal on that sword.

217
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,957
The circumstances were embarassing.

218
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,323
Never mind. What will you do about it?

219
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,424
I've already dispatched a pursuit team.

220
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,268
She may have awakened, but
she's not at full strength yet.

221
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,572
And my slave torture
device is still functional.

222
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,607
Those dogs in the Republic Forces
will be sniffing around here soon.

223
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,477
I'll try to suppress any rumors...

224
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,180
...but the Emperor doesn't
tolerate failure from his servants.

225
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,380
Go to it, Estigar.

226
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:54,742
As you wish.

227
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,894
Heckle! Maya's awake!

228
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:02,561
Oh, good.
Heckle! Maya's awake!

229
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,152
Oh, good.

230
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,126
So, you can't remember anything?

231
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:05,762
Y- Yeah...

232
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,760
Maya, you were incredible!

233
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,194
You sliced those knights
down one after another!

234
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,032
And the way you busted
out holding that sword...!

235
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,972
I'm sorry. I can only remember
up to where I heard the voice.

236
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,081
I'll give you a special, on the house!

237
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,985
So, what is it?

238
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:34,318
How do you like this?
Hyper-heavy armorwear!

239
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,428
No way! I can't move in this!

240
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,428
Well, how about this?

241
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,999
No way! It's too embarrassing!

242
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,294
Well, then, how about this?

243
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,403
Would you knock it off?!

244
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,304
I thought it looked good on you.

245
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,821
Well, maybe this'll do.

246
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,892
Okay, now to deal with your tail.

247
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,857
Isn't there any other way?

248
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,989
Maya, we already went over this.

249
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,532
The only way to Ransberg is
through the Forest of Eral.

250
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:20,528
Right...

251
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,873
Maya, does your tail hurt?

252
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,911
Well, you'll just have to put up
with it till we get to Ransberg.

253
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,579
We'll find you a good
armorer and get it pulled out.

254
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,641
Maya, what's wrong?

255
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,447
Didn't you just hear that?

256
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:36,346
Not me.

257
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,151
I didn't mention this before...

258
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,619
...but they get apparitions around here.

259
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,419
Apparitions?

260
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,291
Like spirits.

261
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,225
I hate ghosts and spirits and things!

262
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,335
That's not the way a warrior should talk.

263
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,562
But...

264
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,799
What happened to all that strength before?

265
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,731
You were incredible, Maya!

266
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,011
You took out all those
soldiers, slice, slice, slice!

267
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,311
That's right. I saved
Heckle and Jaekel before.

268
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,979
Maya! Maya!

269
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,413
Yeah, I'm a warrior. I can't be a coward!

270
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,666
Wow! Incredible as always, Maya.

271
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,538
I thought we were done for!

272
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,608
I was so scared...!

273
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,141
As expected of a Druid warrior.

274
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,148
Who's there?!

275
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,942
Wait for your chance and
then hit them where it hurts.

276
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,752
I compliment you on your plan.

277
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,383
But, will it work against me, Garius?

278
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,250
No way...

279
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,859
Maya, you can't show weakness here!

280
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,685
Show'im who's boss!

281
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,588
R- Right!

282
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,996
Hey, you villain! Come and get me!

283
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,831
If you don't mind, I mean...

284
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,837
You don't have to be polite to him!

285
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,607
Maya, what's wrong?

286
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,440
My vagina...! No... No...

287
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,586
Hedonay!

288
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,952
Maya! Uh, Heckle?

289
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,262
Jaekel, in this situation...

290
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,622
RETREAT!!!

291
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:37,100
One who has our slave torture
device implanted must obey us.

292
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,435
Now take off all your clothes.

293
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,506
No! Don't look at me!

294
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,883
Look at yourself! This is
what you really are now!

295
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:01,995
Such a lovely body. I'll make
you the ultimate sex slave.

296
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,997
Your face when you
awaken will be priceless.

297
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,697
Once we make your body
something to be ashamed of...

298
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,474
...you'll lose the desire
to return to your world.

299
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,399
A Druid warrior... How pathetic.

300
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,450
Let's begin.

301
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,761
You called, Lord Glassmeyer?

302
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,694
Republic Forces members will be here soon.

303
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:14,905
If they do anything suspicious,
you know what to do.

304
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:15,596
As you wish.

305
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,046
Once the transformation is complete...

306
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,479
...the legendary warrior
will be a mere sex slave.

307
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:33,050
I wonder what the Republic Forces
will say when they see the new you?

308
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,094
Full power!

309
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,726
What do you think they're doing to Maya?

310
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,328
Dunno...

311
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,902
I hope it isn't anything too horrible.

312
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,174
What's a Republic Forces ship doing here?!

313
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,739
I think something major's starting.

314
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,172
Yeah, a Druid warrior...

315
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,976
I heard about it when I was young.

316
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,081
My mom used to tell me
the story over and over.

317
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,385
The legendary warrior. The
holy sword of the Druid.

318
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,254
You mean the sword Maya had?

319
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,990
Yeah. They shall appear
in the humblest of forms.

320
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,093
Superior to man or woman,
they will save the world.

321
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,106
Maya, what's going to happen to you?
