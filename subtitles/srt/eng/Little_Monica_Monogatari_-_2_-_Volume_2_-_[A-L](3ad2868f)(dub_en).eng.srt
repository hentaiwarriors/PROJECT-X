1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,620
Give a synopsis of the last episode, please!

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,390
Eh...

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,500
I have returned to my hometown, Little Monica, after being away for a long time.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,000
The changes I saw were staggering.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,210
Everyone used to love the arts. Everyone used to be generous and happy in this city.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,050
But now, Kajo rules the city, and it is overrun with evil.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,860
How can I restore Little Monica back to the cheerful city that it used to be?

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,360
No... I have to think of the city now.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,500
But it's so hard to concentrate...

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,670
Mei, you shouldn't be doing this. You're going to get in trouble again.

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,200
It's okay. Sis went shopping.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,000
But Mei...

13
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,540
You're the one who said I could do whatever I wanted.

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,280
Hi Mei. I'm researching some things about the city.

15
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,210
You can do whatever you want as long as you don't distract me.

16
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,180
Okay.

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,150
I said as long as you didn't distract me...

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,460
Am I distracting you?

19
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,430
Hi Tina... I didn't know you were there.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,960
Will, I...

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,930
Tina.

22
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,400
Tina, lick this! It tastes just like your cakes!

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,700
Huh? Does that mean it's sweet? That can't be good!

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,070
Well?

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,810
You're right. It's salty.

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,010
Salty?!

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,950
You always put in too much salt.

28
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,620
Oh, now I get it.

29
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,920
Nothing.

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,890
Have another lick. You might grow to like it.

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:41,490
Sure.
Okay.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,900
What obedient girls...

33
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,320
You two really like it, huh?

34
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,730
I don't want to stop.

35
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,770
I can't stop.

36
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,350
You make it sound like it's a shrimp chip.

37
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,180
What is a shrimp chip?

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,190
It's a snack. They are eaten in Asian countries.

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,760
You know so much.

40
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,160
You're so amazing.

41
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,800
But there are things that I can't figure out.

42
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,530
Really?

43
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,730
Like what?

44
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:34,050
Kajo wanted to see all of you naked the other day. What was that all about?

45
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,350
Maybe if I saw you naked again, I might be able to figure it out.

46
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,590
Will you take your clothes off?

47
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:40,690
Okay! Sure!
Will you take your clothes off?

48
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,200
I can't tell by just looking. I should take a closer look.

49
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,490
Can both of you get on the bed?

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,160
I want to check a certain part of your body very well.

51
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,740
A certain part?

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,560
That is...

53
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:02,900
Here!

54
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,820
The temperature and wetness are different. Does this mean something?

55
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,950
Will, I...

56
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,680
You're so amazing, Will.

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,890
Really?

58
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,450
Let me see how you taste.

59
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,250
Spread your legs and lie down.

60
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,230
I'm home!

61
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,720
The Little Monica Story - Part 2

62
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,000
Huh?

63
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,330
Tina? Mei?

64
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,430
They taste slightly different.

65
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,410
The amount and the consistency is also different.

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,480
The size of their breasts and their texture...

67
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,380
They suck differently too.

68
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,690
Tina! Mei! Is anyone home?

69
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,360
Will...

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,120
Will, it feels so good.

71
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,500
They're both really feeling it.

72
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,400
Jeez, those two...

73
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm going to stick it in.

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,770
Will, give it to me.

75
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,880
I want your cock inside me.

76
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,340
Okay.

77
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,310
Hi Celia. Did you need something?

78
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,720
I was looking for Tina and Mei but...

79
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,980
Excuse me. I'm going to go downstairs and prepare the store.

80
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,950
Wait!

81
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,430
Sorry!

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,160
Mei!

83
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,960
You two need to stop slacking off! Jeez...

84
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,630
Will! I need you to supervise those two when I'm gone!

85
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,740
I'm sorry. I was just trying to learn more about the city and I kept holding them up.

86
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,180
Jeez...

87
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,420
Men's rooms smell so bad. Open the windows for a change.

88
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,420
S...Sure. I'll do that from now on.

89
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,350
By the way...

90
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,550
Is there something else?

91
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,060
Do you want to go out to see the city later?

92
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,700
It's hard for you to come up with ideas if you don't see it for yourself.

93
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,140
Good idea. Let's do that. That is great.

94
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,240
There are a lot of thugs...

95
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,040
Some of them are dressed up, but...

96
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,010
They're either here for the prostitutes or the gambling.

97
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,540
It's pretty quiet during the day, but it gets much worse at night.

98
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,550
I didn't think it was so corrupt.

99
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,430
I just realized that I don't hear any music. No one is even humming.

100
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,200
Kajo banned music.

101
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,600
The strip show you went to is one of the few places where it's allowed.

102
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,770
We can only play our instruments because we're not in the center of the city, but...

103
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,780
...we have to be careful. If we get caught, we'll be sent to prison.

104
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,140
This is all because of Kajo...

105
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,450
The first thing we need to do is figure out how to get rid of him.

106
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,480
Kajo has enough money from his shady businesses...

107
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,880
...to bribe both the army and the police.

108
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,950
Everyone is too scared to speak up.

109
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,960
Isn't that Mom?

110
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,470
It looks like her.

111
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,740
I was too young when Mom left, so I don't really remember her.

112
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,810
Let's ask her!

113
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,310
Will!

114
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,270
Excuse me!

115
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,510
Yes?

116
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,010
Are you Ingrid?

117
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:38,480
Are you? This is Celia, Tina, and Mei. Do you remember?

118
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,190
They're your daughters.

119
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,260
I don't have any children. I've given myself to God.

120
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:51,740
I'm sure that you can tell I'm a nun by just looking at me. Are you making fun of me?

121
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,330
Will. Let's go. It's not her.

122
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,280
No, I'm the oldest, so my memory is the best. She's definitely Ingrid.

123
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,710
Please stop!

124
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,820
You're bothering me.

125
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,600
Will.

126
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,370
Celia, I'm sorry I've taken over a corner of your store.

127
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,580
It's just that I can concentrate the best here.

128
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,280
That is fine. Thanks to Kajo we barely get any customers.

129
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,750
Him again... We have to do something quick.

130
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,680
Where are Tina and Mei?

131
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,020
They're cleaning the kitchen. It's their punishment for slacking off the other day.

132
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,320
Then I'd better work hard to rebuild this city.

133
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,030
Will, I had a lot of fun yesterday. Thank you.

134
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,570
About our mother... You did your best for us, so...

135
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,540
Oh, that... I was raised by foster parents, and some things were hard...

136
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,480
I was lonely at times, but... you guys didn't even have that.

137
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,910
When I thought about how hard that must have been, I...

138
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,490
Thank you, Will. It's the thought that counts.

139
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,530
It might not have been her, but we'll have you from now on, so...

140
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,770
You're right. I'll take good care of all of you.

141
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,010
But, I'm really sure that woman is your mother, Ingrid.

142
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,210
It was strange the way that she kept denying it.

143
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,720
That is because she lost her memory.

144
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,550
What is wrong, Will?

145
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,990
Welcome. I didn't even notice you come in.

146
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,960
Oh? Are you friends with Will?

147
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,520
No, I don't know her.

148
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,860
She just surprised me because she said that suddenly.

149
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,530
Oh, really?

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm a traveling fortune-teller. I heard that the coffee here is great, so I stopped by.

151
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,610
When I overheard your interesting conversation, I listened in.

152
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,540
Anyway, is what you just said true?

153
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:23,320
It's true. I met her at the port. I thought she was acting strangely, so I asked her...

154
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,390
She told me that she lost her memory, but she also said...

155
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,890
...that there is something familiar about this place...

156
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,330
...and there is someone out there that is precious to her.

157
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,170
Will! Does that mean...

158
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,240
It must be you girls! That woman is Ingrid!

159
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,610
I'm going to go look for Mother!

160
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,310
Wait! I'll go with you!

161
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,780
She also said there is someone out there who wants to harm her.

162
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:59,120
As far as I can tell, this harm will also affect Little Monica.

163
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,720
I want you to listen, because this has to do with the fate of Little Monica.

164
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,560
You'll still have time to look for your mother afterwards.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,130
Okay, I'll listen. I'll get my sisters.

166
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,940
These are my sisters, Tina and Mei. We're all here now.

167
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,150
I see. I'm Chateau, a fortune-teller.

168
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,610
First, there is something I want to ask you.

169
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,250
Do you know where the town's name, Little Monica, comes from?

170
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,080
Everyone knows that.

171
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,990
Little Monica was the heir of the family that took care of the theater for generations.

172
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,930
She is the one who supported the city.

173
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,360
But one day, she disappeared...

174
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,110
...and I took over the city!

175
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,740
About Little Monica's whereabouts...

176
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,470
...do you know where she is?

177
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,380
Yes, according to a reliable source, Little Monica...

178
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,340
...should have died by my hands, but...

179
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,060
...instead she disappeared in front of his eyes.

180
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,670
Little Monica and her family have the ability to...

181
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,970
...possess other people's bodies. That is probably how she hid herself.

182
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,930
That happened thirteen years ago...

183
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,410
About the same time that Ingrid disappeared!

184
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,810
So Little Monica's spirit is hiding inside Mom's body!

185
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,990
Yes, but Little Monica can only remain there...

186
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,550
...until the night of the full moon of the thirteenth year.

187
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,380
...until the night of the full moon of the thirteenth year.

188
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,660
If she doesn't leave by then, she'll end up killing her host...

189
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:43,300
Little Monica won't do that. She'll definitely leave.

190
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,230
There is no point in killing the host.

191
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,460
My opportunity will come when she leaves the body in spirit form.

192
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,400
That is when the manuscript and birdcage come into play.

193
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,170
If I chant the spell from the manuscript, she'll return to her true self.

194
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,140
Then I'll trap her inside the birdcage, and Little Monica will be finished.

195
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,550
All I need to do is find the woman who is her host.

196
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,380
I see... I read somewhere...

197
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,020
...that when a spirit enters a body, marks will appear on the host's body.

198
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,090
That is why Kajo is checking the women in the city.

199
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,800
He is looking for the scars from when he stabbed her!

200
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,130
Wait... But isn't the full moon...?

201
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:24,770
Tonight.

202
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,470
Yes, it's tonight.

203
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,150
They don't get it, do they...

204
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:46,090
The reason why I stopped to tell you is because I want you to be prepared.

205
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,560
When Little Monica leaves your mother's body...

206
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,160
...if you can't stop Kajo, someone must be willing to take in Little Monica.

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,940
The same person can't be possessed twice.

208
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,070
If you love this city, I want you to be prepared to make this sacrifice.

209
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,380
It's okay. We'll just have to do something about Kajo before that.

210
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,170
But how?

211
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,390
I'll figure something out. You girls go find your mother.

212
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,350
Chateau and I will head to Kajo's mansion.

213
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,590
Okay, Celia...

214
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,220
Sis...

215
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,120
Sis!

216
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,960
What is wrong, Sis? You're spacing out.

217
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,840
Look! That carriage!

218
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,660
Carriage!

219
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,930
Mei said she saw Mom in that carriage!

220
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,570
Really? But that is Kajo's carriage!

221
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,230
I know! We have to go after it!

222
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,620
What did you find?

223
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,360
It's empty. The carriage is gone, so he is gone too.

224
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,660
Damn it! I thought he would be here.

225
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,700
He is probably at the outdoor theater.

226
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,500
This isn't good. We need to meet up with Celia.

227
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,470
What is it, Meow? We have to go.

228
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,810
I can't forget the last time we had sex. I want to fuck you again.

229
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,770
Now? This isn't the time!

230
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,380
But this may be the last time. I might not see you again.

231
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,280
Meow...

232
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,220
You're going to...?

233
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,590
You can't do that! You're not from this city!

234
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,390
That is why. So...

235
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,660
So please, Will?

236
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,300
Meow...

237
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,540
Will, it feels so good...

238
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,380
The grass is so prickly, it's turning me on.

239
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,360
Meow, this isn't like that. It's not that...

240
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,960
When I learned that you had decided to become Little Monica's next host...

241
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,600
...I was really moved.

242
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,940
Huh? I never said that!

243
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,310
I said that I might never see you again after this is over...

244
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,010
...because I'm leaving this city. That is all.

245
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,710
Then this is just sex.

246
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,550
Wouldn't you feel guilty if it wasn't just sex? Especially towards Celia?

247
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,990
Plus, I doubt you want to stop.

248
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,260
Will, touch mine too.

249
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,390
Okay.

250
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:48,100
Will, that feels so nice... I can tell you're starting to get into it.

251
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,710
You're terrible. You're just taking advantage of me.

252
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,750
You're terrible for making me so wet.

253
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,920
I didn't think we would do this again.

254
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,930
Will, it tastes so good.

255
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,600
You too, Meow.

256
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,780
You're so wet.

257
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,680
I can't wait any longer. Fuck me.

258
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,060
It feels so good. Make me feel good.

259
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,650
Okay. Here I come.

260
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,810
Will, your cock is so big. You're filling me up.

261
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,350
It feels so good! I'm going to cum!

262
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,820
I...I can't take anymore!

263
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,420
Me too... I'm gonna cum!

264
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,260
Cum with me!

265
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,180
This is where he must be checking the women.

266
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,180
Does that mean he is in here?

267
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,140
Probably. Let's go in.

268
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,840
We'll get caught if it's just us. We should wait until Will comes.

269
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,850
We don't have time. The moon is almost out.

270
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,620
What is wrong, Tina?

271
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,790
Hi Missy. Long time no see.

272
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,160
No wonder I couldn't find you at the store.

273
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,430
Don't look so depressed. We just had sex.

274
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,810
Sex or no sex, I shouldn't have done that. Now I feel so guilty when I think about Celia.

275
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,080
You can't help it. You're a playboy.
Sex or no sex, I shouldn't have done that. Now I feel so guilty when I think about Celia.

276
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,600
You can't help it. You're a playboy.

277
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,520
Hi, kitty. What is wrong?

278
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,060
That is how I always pictured myself up to now, but when I'm with Celia...

279
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,000
...I don't want to be like that anymore. After talking to her...

280
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,360
What? That isn't good!
...I don't want to be like that anymore. After talking to her...

281
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,030
What? That isn't good!

282
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,800
What?

283
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,640
They saw their mother taken away in a carriage and followed it.

284
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,670
To where?

285
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,740
Probably the outdoor theater. Let's go!

286
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,670
I knew we shouldn't have been having sex! They might have been caught by now!

287
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,710
By the way... Did you think of a way to defeat Kajo?

288
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,520
You promised them you would take care of him.

289
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,760
You're right. We shouldn't move without a plan...

290
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,460
But I haven't thought of one.

291
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,890
No way! I thought you already had a plan. I thought you were ready...

292
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,620
...because it didn't take much to distract you!

293
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,390
I did my homework, but there wasn't any information about his businesses.

294
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,030
There wasn't anything about Kajo, either.

295
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,930
All I know is that he has bad taste.

296
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,030
Have you ever met him?

297
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,570
Once, when he came to the store.

298
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,670
When he came in...

299
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,480
...he was especially sensitive to Ajo playing the violin, and ran out.

300
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,020
On top of that, music is banned in this city.

301
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,120
His weakness is music!

302
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,560
That can't be. They can use music at the strip show. He must hear it.

303
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,700
No, he doesn't hear it.

304
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,870
Really?

305
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,140
Yes, the strip show announcer told me.

306
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:48,210
I'm the one who made Kajo agree to let music be played during the strip show.

307
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:55,380
If I'm announcing, the show must be perfect. It would be stupid without music!

308
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,450
How did you make him agree?

309
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:06,860
I gave Kajo earplugs. I asked him to use them during the show.

310
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,730
Go ahead. Tell me I'm great.

311
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,700
Hell no.

312
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,630
Then I'm right!

313
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,240
Master Kajo. The nun and the sisters are the last ones.

314
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,210
I see. Good work. Oh...

315
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,960
That is the woman who rudely threw me... And her sisters too!

316
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,250
I don't know who the nun is, but...

317
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,830
Why don't we take this opportunity to throw them around?

318
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,590
Great idea. Let's do it!

319
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,870
Idiots! Don't take me seriously. I would never do something so violent!

320
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,800
You're our Mom, right?
Idiots! Don't take me seriously. I would never do something so violent!

321
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,900
Idiots! Don't take me seriously. I would never do something so violent!

322
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,640
Tina! Shh!
Idiots! Don't take me seriously. I would never do something so violent!

323
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:44,900
Idiots! Don't take me seriously. I would never do something so violent!

324
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,010
She has to be! She is our Mom!
Idiots! Don't take me seriously. I would never do something so violent!

325
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,040
She has to be! She is our Mom!

326
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,140
She has to be! She is our Mom!
Really?

327
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:47,440
Yes! There should be a more elegant way of doing it. Let me think.

328
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,270
Mei, you too! Who knows what they'll do if we don't stay quiet!
Yes! There should be a more elegant way of doing it. Let me think.

329
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:56,280
What are they doing over there! Don't they know they're hostages?

330
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,910
Oh forget it. Let's get it over with. Take their clothes off.

331
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:01,940
Sis!

332
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,050
No, don't come near me!

333
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,920
D...Don't worry. Calm down. Will is going save us.

334
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,320
Everyone stand back!

335
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,590
What is this? Why are we caging them in?

336
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,740
What is this? What is going on?

337
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,740
It's okay. It's a stage prop. I've cut your ropes.

338
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,210
Chateau, thank you.

339
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,240
It's too bad I'm not Will, huh?

340
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,480
You're the woman from the port.

341
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,010
It's good to see you again. You're going to escape with me.

342
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,080
You three go behind the stage and wait for us in the orchestra pit.

343
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,350
There is an orchestra pit in the back?

344
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,520
No time to chat. Hurry!

345
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,250
Forget the stage prop. Open the curtains! Hurry!

346
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,660
How long are you guys going to sit there?

347
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,330
Hurry up and do something!

348
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,060
Y...Yes Master Kajo!

349
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,440
Where is Will?

350
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,400
He went back to get Ajo. He should be back at any minute.

351
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,670
Ajo?

352
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,470
Hurry and get in.

353
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,310
We're going to run straight ahead. It's the fastest way out of this tent.

354
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,990
Don't worry. Just hold my hand and run.

355
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,130
I see! I see! I seeee! You're the one Little Monica possessed.

356
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,470
Finally, the time has come. The night of the full moon of the thirteenth year is here.

357
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,480
Come out Little Monica, or else the nun is going to die.

358
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,450
Once you come out, you're going turn into a canary and live in this cage.

359
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:47,930
This city will belong to me! I'm going to change its name to Kajo!

360
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,650
Wait! I won't let that happen!

361
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,120
You again! Are you going to stop me?

362
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,030
Not stop you, finish you off!

363
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,000
What?

364
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,270
Go, Ajo!

365
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,870
I discovered your weakness! But that is just the beginning!

366
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,780
The curtain is going up.

367
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,010
Are we supposed to play now?

368
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,020
It's fine. Let's trust Will and play.

369
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,420
How do you like that, Kajo?

370
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,630
Huh? What happened to me?

371
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,910
I see. Ajo was the embodiment of Kajo's love of music. It must have escaped.

372
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,710
But I didn't know that he was possessed by a rat.

373
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,850
Mom!

374
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,020
The scar on your back... Does that mean that you really are our mother?

375
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,260
Mom, don't you remember us?

376
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,930
I'm glad it worked out, Will. Bye!

377
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,860
Really?

378
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,760
Mei... Tina... and Celia...

379
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,370
Yes, Mom...

380
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,330
I'm so surprised. You're all grown up.

381
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,170
I'm sorry to surprise you.

382
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,580
It's fine.

383
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,380
Mom!

384
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,740
My dear daughters...

385
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,870
Mom.

386
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,520
Thank you.

387
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,650
Thanks to everyone, the evil Kajo is no more.

388
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,960
Little Monica.

389
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,420
I'm sure that with your hard work...

390
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,000
...peace will return to Little Monica...

391
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,410
I believe that day will come, and I will be watching from afar.

392
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,360
The show is going to start, but they're not back yet.

393
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,850
Did they say where they were going? It's about to start.

394
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,690
The main reason I came back here was to see you again.

395
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,000
I love you. I always have. I only have eyes for you.

396
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,880
Me too, Will.

397
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,980
Will, make love to me...

398
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,220
Not yet, Celia. Go down on me.

399
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,100
Good, Celia. Can you do it with your mouth?

400
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,480
That is good. It feels really good.

401
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,820
It feels really good... I'm going to cum soon.

402
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:41,850
Are you sure?

403
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,550
Yes.

404
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,760
Are you all right, Celia?

405
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,540
I'm okay. It feels really good.

406
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:52,900
Celia.

407
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm so happy. We've become one. I'm so happy...

408
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,940
Me too...

409
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,350
It feels so good.

410
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,990
More. Fuck me harder.

411
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,430
Your hard cock is thrusting in and out...

412
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,370
You're the best, Celia. I love you.

413
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,930
I love you too.

414
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,940
I'm going to cum...

415
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,370
Go ahead... cum.
