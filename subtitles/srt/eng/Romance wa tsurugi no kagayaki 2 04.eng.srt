1
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:06,547
Elfarcia...

2
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:12,948
Alright!
I'll enter from the front door after all.

3
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:18,394
Huh?

4
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:22,624
Flower girl?

5
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:25,764
This early in the morning?

6
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,865
Well, let me get some flowers for Elfarcia...

7
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:30,204
Huh?

8
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:36,181
Where's she going?
Hey, you left your basket behind!

9
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:49,059
Hmm? Sun's setting all of a sudden.
What's going on?

10
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:57,793
Kinda strange wood.

11
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:05,876
Oh well, what about her?
Where'd she go? Hmm?

12
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:16,512
B-Beauty...

13
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:31,136
A legendary unicorn!

14
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:32,705
Yup. Unicorn!

15
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,531
Hush... Be quiet!

16
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:43,815
B- Beauty...

17
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:47,114
It's a job I got from a dying geezer.

18
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:50,384
I've looked for it over a month,
and I finally found it.

19
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:53,684
M... Mysty?!

20
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:57,424
Tut, not even recognizing
your childhood pal...

21
00:01:57,497 --> 00:02:01,558
Keith, you aren't after it yourself, are you?

22
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:03,334
Lt?

23
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:07,629
The horn of the unicorn,
known to heal any illness...

24
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:11,234
Wait! You're after that female elf, are you?!

25
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:15,814
Geez, you haven't changed a bit...

26
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,984
But, I think it's gonna be trouble...

27
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:25,856
Don't know why, but unicorns only make
their appearance in front of virgin girls.

28
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:29,588
And, that means, she's gotta be a virgin.

29
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:35,434
Elves are puritanical to begin with,
and she's a virgin to top it off...

30
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,199
Is that to anesthetize it?

31
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:42,904
Yup, if I could capture it alive,
I'll have endless supply of the horns...

32
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:45,376
because they regenerate after being cut off.

33
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:49,106
Wow... she's grown up. Yeah.

34
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:50,338
What?

35
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,214
Oh, no-nothing, nothing at all...

36
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:13,071
Oh, I finally found it!
Get the net ready, would ya?

37
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:16,472
The girl... Capture the girl too?

38
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:21,473
There's no point without her. Just go
and get ready! And clean yourself up.

39
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:23,705
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:32,419
Shit! I won't let you!

41
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:33,784
Mysty!

42
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:58,217
Romance is in the Flash of the Sword II

43
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:04,122
Episode 4 "Unicorn... Oh, Hurry up!?"

44
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:09,392
Humph... Where'd Keith go?

45
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:13,057
Look at that. Leaving us here with
all the work of the restaurant...

46
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:17,762
How could he subject us to this
physical labor? How could he?

47
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:22,474
Well I get what you're sayin', but we didn't
really ask you to help, alright.

48
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:25,233
Oh, no, Slimester!

49
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:27,336
You can't treat me like that!

50
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,678
Oh no. You have to be good to me.

51
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:34,345
You cannot tease me. I'm to be treated
with respect, you know. So don't be...

52
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:38,414
What's that?

53
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,152
From the Forest of Deception...

54
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,160
See the plume of misty water?

55
00:04:48,568 --> 00:04:52,902
It was a big noise.
Wonder if the volcano erupted...

56
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:55,768
My lady! Are you okay?

57
00:04:55,842 --> 00:05:00,040
Oh, I'm glad you're fine.
I just heard a violent explosion. Hmm?

58
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:11,754
How dangerously close... Oh... That's...

59
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,458
Mr. Angel! He's going away.

60
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:20,525
This must be a sign
for me to follow after him!

61
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,696
I shouldn't just wait for him to come to me...
Gramps!

62
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,329
Why, yes?

63
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,597
Gramps! Let's follow it!

64
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:31,871
Yes, ma'am. As you wish, my lady.

65
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:38,543
You okay, Mysty?

66
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:43,352
Stole my booty! I won't let them escape!

67
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,153
Tut, the gale blew me so hard,
I latched onto this, but what's goin' on?

68
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:50,251
Help.

69
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:51,364
Hmm?

70
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:54,094
Help me, please.

71
00:05:56,102 --> 00:06:00,004
Don't worry! I'll rescue you! Stay there!

72
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,429
You are?

73
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:03,632
Keith Ryan!!

74
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:05,941
Keith... Keith Ryan.

75
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:13,846
What's that?

76
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,353
It's not a bird.

77
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:17,788
I saw people hanging from it.

78
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:22,927
Wait! Wasn't that Keith?

79
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:25,988
Oh no! He was with a girl! Hmmm?

80
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:39,440
Say, I smell some treasure.

81
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:45,947
The winner's shield is encrusted with
the King's treasured jewel then?

82
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:48,920
That's right. The winner of
the Toolux Darby tonight...

83
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:53,015
shall receive it from King Lune
to celebrate the 100th event.

84
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,184
The race is open to anyone...

85
00:06:55,261 --> 00:07:00,028
and that's why the best of the best around
the country and abroad are gathered here...

86
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:03,465
But, we know who's the winner.

87
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:07,097
It should be Farlanks,
the Chief of the Royal Elite Force.

88
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:15,807
Tut, the Chief of
the Royal Elite Force, Farlanks.

89
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:22,651
With them competing, I can't fix the race
or drug the competition. It's not fair.

90
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:25,823
You've privatized
the Horse Racing Association...

91
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:28,156
and always rigged the races
without interference.

92
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:31,493
This is your reward
for pilfering the winnings, I say.

93
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:33,859
Cut it out!

94
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:40,668
All you have to do is to win the race
as I ordered you. Just do it and stop talking!

95
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,641
And, without rigging the race
or risking anything...

96
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,841
you'll win your bets and make money,
loads and loads of money. It's great!

97
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,046
That's right.

98
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:55,178
If you, a nameless rider,
can beat the strongest candidate...

99
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:59,123
the Chief of Royal Elite Force, Farlanks,
and steal the victory...

100
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:03,754
then, I'll pay you the money I promised,
along with the winner's shield!

101
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,759
Good. Stay calm and quiet...

102
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:19,438
It sure is extremely fast,
but what about the rider?

103
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:24,341
Don't worry.
Everything's already been taken care of...

104
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:31,848
Oh, Geez, they can't fly this thing for beans.

105
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,359
Couldn't they land
without slamming it down?

106
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:37,590
My head hurts, it really does.

107
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,330
You're finally up!

108
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,897
Stop jabbering and help me down from here!
Geez! Come on!

109
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,307
Nice view...

110
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:53,473
No! Please don't!

111
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,978
I smell a virgin...

112
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,287
Smells delicious...

113
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:05,813
No...

114
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:10,659
- No... Please don't!
- Nipple... nipple... Found it.

115
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,689
- Rub, rub... squeeze, squeeze.
- Stop!

116
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,032
Let me stick my finger in...

117
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:25,806
It hurts... no... no, don't... please don't...

118
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:31,140
- Oh, no... please, no... don't!
- How about my other finger?

119
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:33,681
This is the bowler's grip.

120
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:39,780
Squeeze, squeeze. Nipple, nipple.

121
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:41,787
No...

122
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:47,765
You say don't, but you're very wet...

123
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:51,294
Please, stop.

124
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:52,994
No...

125
00:09:55,708 --> 00:10:00,407
Instead of one, let me try two. How's it feel?

126
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:04,481
No, stop, please.

127
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,108
Please!

128
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:11,385
Keith, please help me now...
Please help me. No, don't!

129
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,114
No!

130
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:16,385
Don't... please...

131
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:19,553
Don't...

132
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:26,898
I want her! But I was told
to restrain myself...

133
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,834
But just a little...
Maybe just the tip of my little...

134
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:33,511
Yeah, I want it!

135
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,712
No!

136
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:36,904
Don't!

137
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:39,846
Oh, no!

138
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:41,577
Keith, where are you?

139
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:52,062
You, idiot! If she loses her virginity,
she'll be worthless to me!

140
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,763
I'm... l'm sorry...

141
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:59,399
Now... You must listen to me.

142
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:04,239
It's simple. You must win the race
riding that unicorn! Understand?

143
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,710
- There's no second place.
- Why... me?

144
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:10,811
There's only one elf among all elves...

145
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:13,511
who can ride on that difficult
and headstrong unicorn.

146
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:14,848
And that's you.

147
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,853
But... l'm just...

148
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,290
You're just... begging the unicorn...

149
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:27,197
to save the villagers who suffer
from that strange infectious disease?

150
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:47,851
Please, Unicorn.
Help the villagers with your power...

151
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,748
How'd you know?

152
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:55,984
Because, this is the cause of the disease.

153
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:57,553
It was you?

154
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,827
That's right. And that's why it's easy
to make all the vaccine we need.

155
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:08,738
It'll be more reliable than
the horn of a unicorn, wouldn't you say?

156
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:16,107
Good girl. Alright, put some clothes on her
and take her away.

157
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:21,250
Now, I'm guaranteed to get
the King's treasured jewel!

158
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,917
It's too good to be appreciated by those
interested only in money, wealth and power.

159
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:32,998
Shit!

160
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,523
Don't be a fool.

161
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:39,665
If you dive in right now,
you'd be overpowered.

162
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:43,465
It's not like she's in a dire situation.

163
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:47,569
Let's wait for the right opportunity...

164
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,940
Er... nothing.

165
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:57,547
It's just that I realize, Mysty,
you've grown up a lot since I saw you last.

166
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:04,154
Careful!

167
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:17,206
Keith... Don't hold me so tightly.

168
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:20,609
It's getting me in a strange mood...

169
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:22,481
Me too...

170
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,374
What're you doing?

171
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:38,225
Stop... what're you...

172
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:40,791
No...

173
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,133
No, I'm embarassed.

174
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,042
I can see yours clearly, Mysty...

175
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:52,366
Don't...

176
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:55,046
You're... already wet...

177
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:58,106
Don't... stop teasing me...

178
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,715
Then... l'll get inside you...

179
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:09,058
Teaser... don't stop...

180
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:10,651
Then how's this?

181
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:28,371
I'm bursting... no... gently...

182
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:36,446
Harder... no... no... more... more...

183
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:38,747
I'm going crazy... more...

184
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:45,524
Falling... falling... I can't take it.

185
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:52,429
No... l'm coming... coming... coming...

186
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:12,180
Mr. Angel.
He disappeared over the horizon...

187
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,225
I'm sorry, my lady.

188
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:19,728
You must understand, this is an antique,
handed down from our ancestors...

189
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,597
Oh, Gramps, your face is dirty...

190
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,531
Ah, my lady, don't bother.
How thoughtful you are.

191
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:30,132
Oh no, I made it even dirtier...

192
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:38,640
Gramps... Funny! Oh, Gramps,
don't make me laugh like that...

193
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:46,522
Are we lost now?

194
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:47,752
That never happens.

195
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:52,127
What are you talkin' about, you idiot?
We lost sight a long time ago.

196
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:56,224
My sense of smell is superhuman,
you know.

197
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:59,264
You're smelling the treasure?

198
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:02,330
Nope... The scent of Keith!

199
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:05,233
Eeek... Nauseating!

200
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:10,247
Oh no, Slimester! It's yucky!

201
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:14,851
Our majesties are seated now.

202
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:17,045
Soon, the race should begin.

203
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,856
Woa, what glitzy costumes!

204
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:30,233
It helps celebrate the 100th anniversary.

205
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:33,739
This'll help not to draw attention
to the elf and the unicorn.

206
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:35,706
Oh, I gotcha!

207
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:41,411
As soon as she reaches the goal, secure
them! I'll go get the shield! Understand?

208
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:42,679
Right!

209
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:46,515
Anyway, she's chained,
so she won't be able to escape...

210
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:47,711
Keith Ryan...

211
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:54,119
Hmm... a shooting star...

212
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:58,386
Mr. Angel, I suppose I shouldn't have
come after you...

213
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:02,564
Oh, this marshmallow is delicious! Yummy.

214
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:07,238
Success, my lady, it's finally repaired!

215
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:08,898
Gramps... Let's go home.

216
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:15,139
I'm sure Mr. Angel will make my wish come
true if I wait patiently. So, let's go home.

217
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:17,179
Please, let's go home.

218
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,874
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:29,021
Hey, hey, ladies...
You're totally distracting from the race.

220
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:32,394
Those jewels of yours
are dying to rest in my pocket...

221
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,534
I get it. We're here for Keith, aren't we?
What are you thinkin' about, man?

222
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:40,237
Ah, no worries.

223
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:43,673
I'm sure Keith's working hard,
doing his thing.

224
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,208
You know how he does it.

225
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:47,141
Keith'll be angry to hear that.

226
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:50,979
He's not a pickpocket
or small-time sneaky thief, you know.

227
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:57,684
Incredible! There's no comparison
with any other jewels I've...

228
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:05,285
Gramps...

229
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:06,262
Yes?

230
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:08,297
It was fun.

231
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,827
Will you take me out like this again?

232
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:16,097
As you wish, my lady.

233
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,113
What do I do?

234
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,658
Because this is the cause of the disease.

235
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:45,392
It was you?

236
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:50,399
That's right. And that's why it's easy
to make all the vaccine we need.

237
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:55,942
It'll be more reliable than
the horn of a unicorn, wouldn't you say?

238
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,885
You see, Farlanks is winning.

239
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:08,482
With a big lead... as expected...

240
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:22,366
Looks like it's gonna work out.
So, what's the plan?

241
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:27,375
Once she reaches the goal,
we'll bring her and the unicorn back.

242
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:31,576
We'll get rid of those two men,
so that they don't cause us any trouble.

243
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:36,118
There's no reason to give up
the winning shield.

244
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:40,784
We'll just make sure not to let
the Elite Force notice anything...

245
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:52,130
Crap, I think I hit something...

246
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:55,402
Hey, can't you do better?

247
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:57,465
Why don't you fly this then?

248
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,502
Er... no, I trust you. So, what's next?

249
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:06,211
Don't you know? We'll get the unicorn back
using their method!

250
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:08,544
Great idea...

251
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:11,422
You, ready?

252
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:17,758
Where'd you go?

253
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:20,759
Set up a trick...

254
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,322
A trick?

255
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:26,597
Yup, to get that treasure, you know.
That treasure up there...

256
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:41,778
I see her!

257
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:44,148
Alright! Get the net ready.

258
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:45,581
Sure will!

259
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:48,891
It's about time...

260
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:03,531
Oh, yummy! My favorite!

261
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:10,538
Meanwhile, I'll get the treasure!

262
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:15,979
The horses have gone wild
for all of the carrots!

263
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:19,548
Our plan! We didn't even have the sex...

264
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,894
Ellis!! I'm here to rescue you!

265
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:31,400
Keith Ryan!

266
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:43,004
Woa, was that Keith just now?

267
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:47,813
I got it!

268
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:50,320
We'll take her back to her elf village...

269
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:54,416
and they'll let me have the unicorn's horn
as a reward... That's it!

270
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:06,401
You sure it's okay?

271
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:09,902
Yes. The unicorn promised
to save the villagers.

272
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:14,207
As for me, as an elf, I must fulfill
my elfin pledge to my rescuer.

273
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:31,594
So, it's alright...

274
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:33,731
You'll be gentle, will you?

275
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:41,936
I'm embarrassed...

276
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:47,044
You're beautiful, Ellis...

277
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:50,645
You're already wet...

278
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:56,348
I want your strength too, Keith Ryan...

279
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:02,860
How muscular... and big... hot...

280
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:14,336
That's good, Ellis...

281
00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:19,142
That feels really good, Ellis.

282
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,010
I want you... but I'm scared... it's so big...

283
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:27,774
Don't...

284
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:39,790
I'm going crazy... l'm scared... hurry, Keith...

285
00:23:42,968 --> 00:23:45,766
I'm scared... no... oh, no...

286
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:53,242
Don't... it hurts... slowly... it's hot... it's hot.

287
00:23:56,882 --> 00:24:01,182
Don't... l'm... I'm so full... oh, no.

288
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:05,516
It's good... it's good...

289
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:09,717
Makes me feel... l'm coming...

290
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:27,644
Finally! I can see the forest of unicorns
right up ahead!

291
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,847
Hey, Keith! We'll be landing soon!

292
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:35,784
Keith? Hey, Keith!

293
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:40,350
Say something? What's wrong?

294
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:57,140
You promiscuous man!
Get out and cool your head!

295
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:01,402
Hmm... lt's cold...

296
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:16,724
Mr. Angel, please hear my wish once again.

297
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:21,555
Ah, Mr. Angel!

298
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:30,536
Mr. Angel... You've heard my wish...

299
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:37,776
Your wish?

300
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:42,810
You must be here to deliver
my Silver Rainbow...

301
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:46,051
Yeah. I'm here to...

302
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:53,162
I can't come out for a reason.
Can you come over here?

303
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,091
Yes!

304
00:25:58,203 --> 00:25:59,670
Here! Is this it?

305
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:03,898
Yes! Oh! So, you are my Mr. Angel!

306
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:07,703
It was not really a big deal.

307
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:17,353
What's that?

308
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:21,849
Nothing! It's nothing!

309
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:30,859
I don't mean to take advantage,
but if you like what I've done...

310
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:32,429
Oh, yes...

311
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:37,132
To my wet lips,
your soft, sweet and melting...

312
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:41,806
Yes...

313
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:46,281
Now, come here... soft... Elfarcia.

314
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,821
Soft and sweet, melting.

315
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:55,993
A kiss from you... melting... Melting?

316
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:59,686
Hmm? Marshmallow!

317
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:03,868
Yes, my favorite, sweet and melting.

318
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:06,564
Delicious, isn't it?
Would you like another one?

319
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:09,105
I bet you'd really like it.

320
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:14,610
Oh, Mr. Angel...

321
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:17,707
Oh, he must've left.

322
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,042
My Mr. Angel...

323
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:22,813
I haven't left yet!

324
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:32,819
Ouch... My butt... my butt... it hurts!

325
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:36,565
If the moonlight wasn't this bright,
I could go home naked...

326
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:42,267
but anyone who sees me will treat me
like a pervert... Hmm? That girl.

327
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:45,136
She's Spika, I'm sure.

328
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,078
Oh, I'm lucky! Hey! Spika!

329
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:59,248
I'm sure she's Spika... but not Spika?

330
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:09,263
Eeek! What's that?

331
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:15,963
B... Beauty...
