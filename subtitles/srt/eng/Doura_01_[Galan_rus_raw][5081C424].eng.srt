1
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,850
Israndia will be punished by banishment!

2
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,850
That's right! That's right!

3
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,850
As the guild's god, his mistake is inexcusable!

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,750
It is indeed inexcusable!

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,840
Execute the banishment.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:25,990
Banish him!

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,950
It must not be delayed.
Banish him!

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,610
It must not be delayed.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,980
That was a small, insignificant experimental mistake, but

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,350
the alchemists of the guild banished me.

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,350
With an exceptional ability, I climbed to the top of the of the Alchemist guild, but
My name is Israndia.

12
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,600
With an exceptional ability, I climbed to the top of the of the Alchemist guild, but

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,150
it appears I've received resentment and jealousy from my peers.

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,200
Those men should cry.

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,740
However,

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,450
as long as they are alchemists

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,400
I cannot let them be.

18
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,620
After 15 years passed

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,460
I have returned to this capital.

20
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:19,850
That's right.

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,050
My purpose is revenge.

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,100
Aria will be sent in as Emperor Clarence's consort clerk.

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,470
If Aria is able to seduce the emperor,

24
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,640
in other words, as the governor of this country

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,120
I will be able to single-handedly obtain power.

26
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,080
At that time

27
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,850
I'll be able to exercise divine retribution

28
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,080
to those foolish people that banished me.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,340
Banish him!

30
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,080
There are still 35 days until the qualifying competition

31
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,130
for the choosing of the new clerk candidate.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,230
I waited for that day,

33
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,010
hiding in this town's slum.

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,170
The greatest humiliation received as an alchemist.

35
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,880
I waited for 15 years to get rid of this grudge.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,390
15 years of channeling my rage into energy to continue my research.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,900
So much energy and time

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,400
and finally the day has arrived.

39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,550
Prima materia, deliverance from the original sin,

40
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,380
philosophical marriage of the King and Queen of Love,

41
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,920
and then the creation of the Philosopher's stone.

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,930
The thing that was born from that was the Doura.

43
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,900
I gave Doura a magical power to seduce the Emperor

44
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,720
and placed it into an artificial human, Aria who is much older than she appears.

45
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,960
Wake up, Aria.

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,350
Aria, your creator is calling you.

47
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,180
Your name is Aria.

48
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,990
I understood. My name is Aria.

49
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:27,600
DOURA

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,000
I brought books and experiment tools into some place in the slum of the city,

51
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,640
and made preparations with her.

52
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,410
I called this place a pharmacy just for appearance, as I never thought to sell drugs.

53
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,460
Look there.

54
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,140
You're right.

55
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,800
Suspicious.

56
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,810
Look over here!

57
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,950
Get away, brats!

58
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,270
Master...

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,210
It's okay for cleaning. Get inside.

60
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,790
Yes.

61
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,540
If I didn't do this way, my precious time would disappear.

62
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,970
My only purpose is revenge.

63
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,230
I have no time to spend on trivial things.

64
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,360
To prepare my revenge, I have sent a mail to an alchemist Yanburikos.

65
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,990
When the entire guild decided to banish me,

66
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,890
he covered me for an obvious reason.

67
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,720
Hello.

68
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,210
My name is Yanburikos.

69
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,930
Can I see Israndia?

70
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,080
Yes, please come in.

71
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,200
Yanburikos is famous in the Emperor's palace.

72
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,910
He also is a member of the selection committee for the new clerk.

73
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,300
I made him introduce at least one more member

74
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,260
to dispatch Aria in the royal palace.

75
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,110
Mr. Yanburikos came to visit you.

76
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,630
Let him in.

77
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,690
Yes.

78
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,970
Thank you, miss.

79
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,040
Yanburikos is a doctor's disciple,

80
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,060
but he has a bad habit of giving female patients the wrong prescriptions

81
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
and by that I mean his cock.

82
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,020
Looks like it's ready, huh?

83
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,540
I believe we had a deal that I provide the medicine to your place in time.

84
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,660
Doesn't it matter, my friend?

85
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,730
Let me check it here.

86
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,240
Let's finish today's job before that.

87
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,060
Oh, don't worry about that.

88
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,800
I will introduce you to Pennel and Jack.

89
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,340
Both of them are members of the selection committee.

90
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,220
They will recommend your very capable Aria for sure.

91
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,870
And I will order a lot luxury items from you.

92
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,590
So let me check it right now.

93
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,620
All right, watch from there.

94
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,220
I thought I will be testing it.

95
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,960
Owing to Yanburikos's mediation, I received luxury grocery orders

96
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,400
from Pennel, the lesbian, and the older brother of the emperor,

97
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,520
named Jack; Duke Sharol's butler.

98
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,370
Both of them are essential for my revenge toward the guild

99
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,110
being completed.

100
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,610
It's indecent work as far as I'm concerned,

101
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,610
but I'm ready to do whatever it takes to accomplish my mission.

102
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,210
Hey, Aria, where are you?

103
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,900
Yes, my master?

104
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,280
We're going out, with you.

105
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,670
Eh?

106
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,340
I must show Aria the capital city.

107
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,760
I took Aria shopping.

108
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,530
The next one is a snake shop.

109
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,840
An exotic shop where we can get

110
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,120
cheap yet quality materials.

111
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,140
Sure!

112
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,890
Yet I'm angry at them.

113
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,590
Pennel's order is a rotor and some lubricants.

114
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,040
Jack's one is ropes and a cylindrical enema syringe.

115
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,410
And this is what they are ordering from the

116
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,900
unique alchemist, me?

117
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,980
Oh, that's bad.

118
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,000
I was immersed in shopping too much.

119
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,190
Where are you, Aria?

120
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,030
Aria!

121
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,910
Hey, little lady,

122
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,290
looks like you're lost, let us walk you home.

123
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,990
Hey, not necessary.

124
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,410
Isn't she the stepsister of that chemist?

125
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,910
Oh, shut up.

126
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,560
They say he is brewing some strange magic!

127
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,800
So what?

128
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,010
What's the issue?

129
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,650
Why do I have to listen to that?

130
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,210
Let me walk you home.

131
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,720
If you really want to.

132
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,630
No need to worry.

133
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,020
Let's have a talk at my home?

134
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,880
I'm a sorcerer, and Aria is pretending to be my stepsister.

135
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,740
That's convenient that the folks think this way.

136
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,700
It's a proof that my disguise is just fine.

137
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,470
Hey, Aria, what are you doing?

138
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,420
Do you have something for my stepsister?

139
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,550
N-no...

140
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,570
We thought she's lost and were to bring her to your home.

141
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,020
That's so kind of you.

142
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,140
But please don't worry.

143
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,350
I'm here, after all.

144
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,750
T-thank you very much.

145
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,290
I believe you have understood now.

146
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,820
The place we're living in is not safe.

147
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,510
Be careful.

148
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,910
Yes.

149
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,470
The deadline for provision of the lubricants that Pennel ordered is close.

150
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,370
I'm sure it's good, but I must test it.

151
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,160
Master, I removed my clothes.

152
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,010
Put your hands behind.

153
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,250
Yes.

154
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,700
Sit on the floor.

155
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,920
Yes.

156
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,400
Is it cold?

157
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,380
Yes.

158
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,720
I see.

159
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,520
Try to hold.

160
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,600
Also, avoid bumping your head against the stone floor.

161
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,740
I feel bad.

162
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,370
I see. Hold on.

163
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,280
Yet, I can see everything from here.

164
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,410
I feel a bit shy.

165
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,350
Your work involves this.

166
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,950
Oops. If you get wet I can't do the test properly.

167
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,970
What is it?

168
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,840
An essential element for the revenge.

169
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,870
It's wet.

170
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,290
The matter in the bottle is similar to Aria's nectar.

171
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,090
The same lubricant.

172
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,340
I made it with the same viscosity, smell, taste.

173
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,290
Using this, they will be able to penetrate from both sides.

174
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,990
Even for the first time.

175
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,440
This is a good usage, too.

176
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,810
Eh, master...

177
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,120
How do you feel? You feel amazing right?

178
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,440
What is it? Looks like you're enjoying something.

179
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,920
It's nice.

180
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,720
Answer honestly.

181
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,870
Please don't be stressed.

182
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,170
Of course. It's for testing purposes.

183
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,480
Please, give me...

184
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,450
the master's one.

185
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,270
I understand your feelings, but...

186
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,300
If you continue like this, I'll come!

187
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,140
The master's...

188
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,350
Master...

189
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,440
I don't need to use anything.

190
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,890
Don't worry, Aria.

191
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,640
Oh, don't stop!

192
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,670
Walking along the windows, I'm hearing Aria's voice more often.

193
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,600
Oh, keep doing that.

194
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,720
I guess she's having fun with somebody.

195
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,900
Hey!

196
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,740
Don't you dare disobey!

197
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,170
She's acting like me.

198
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,030
"You're just a doll, don't you dare speak like me."

199
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,890
A doll?

200
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,520
Oh, I forgot!

201
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,980
Aria is a doll, not a human.

202
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,770
Right there!

203
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,060
Master, do you need something?

204
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,650
Oh, no.

205
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,660
I heard strange voices.

206
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,290
I thought somebody snuck into the house before we came.

207
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,840
Did you worry about me?

208
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,390
Aria, who were you speaking with?

209
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,690
Are you hiding somebody from me?

210
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,700
If you won't get mad...

211
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,880
Is it something that will upset me?

212
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,560
I am sorry, but I have a pet.

213
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,570
Aria, where did you get it?

214
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,130
I saw it chased by cats in the backyard.

215
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,620
I feel it would be teased if I let it go again, so.

216
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,430
Please, let me have it.

217
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,830
I will take care of him.

218
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,060
I was so impressed with how Aria was.

219
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,270
I never thought she could be so serious.

220
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,400
It must be some important.

221
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,290
Do as you like.

222
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,610
Thank you very much!

223
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,190
Are you happy?

224
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,180
His name is Albert, it's the first artificial existence I made.

225
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,110
Eh?

226
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,610
In other words, he is your stepbrother.

227
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,740
He had ran away before I made you.

228
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,050
I never expected to meet him now.

229
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,630
My stepbrother?

230
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,280
Take care of him.

231
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,560
Sure!

232
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,780
For some reason, I felt reassured when I got to know that

233
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,200
Aria was speaking with Albert.

234
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,440
When I am immersed in research, I can't do anything else,

235
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,070
and have problems dealing with every day life.

236
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,200
Letting Albert go was one of those issues.

237
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,790
However, since I received requests from Yanburikos, Jack, and Pennel,

238
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,970
and get to research, my stress increased severely.

239
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,700
Recently, I noticed that my stress is reduced

240
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,730
thanks to Albert.

241
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,840
Wait, Albert!

242
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,130
His quick movements make a human's heart lighter.

243
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,600
The same was true for Aria, as well.

244
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,950
I'll give you this.

245
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,810
Earlier, when I saw somebody talking with a pet,

246
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,560
I thought it's a stupid thing that can't understand words,

247
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,400
but now I get why they did it.

248
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,990
Experience is the mother of knowledge,

249
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,520
and books are no more than its older cousin.

250
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,770
Now I understand this ancient saying.

251
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,140
There is no sense in crying. You still have your ginseng.

252
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,630
You'll get meat after this.

253
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,820
Hmm, Aria, your meat cooking skills have improved.

254
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,950
Why don't you eat it, Aria?

255
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,810
Hey, are you angry about something?

256
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,190
Oh, you finished eating. I'll give you some meat, then.

257
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,120
Say it aloud, if you're unhappy with something.

258
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,120
Aria, stop it already.

259
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,630
You're not a child, you can eat it by yourself.

260
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,980
Aria is a child.

261
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,780
When a child gets a new younger sibling,

262
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,640
it acts the same as an infant to get the parent's attention.

263
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,360
I guess Aria feels jealousy towards Albert.

264
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,030
What is it? Are you starting this time?

265
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,130
I can't eat now.

266
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,020
Master, I'll feed you.

267
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,120
I am not a child.

268
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,700
Here! Is it tasty?

269
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,200
What would happen with my dignity?

270
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,490
However, watching Aria's face change

271
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,250
made me think it's okay sometimes.

272
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,620
Elections will start in no more than 24 days.

273
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,460
The items that Yanburikos ordered will be ready in time.

274
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,330
In tandem, I have to teach Aria the art of seduction

275
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,830
to get the emperor Clarence.

276
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,760
Okay, go do it.

277
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,000
I am not happy using myself for the experiment,

278
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,150
but I had to test the sex object I will give up.

279
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,570
What is it? Go ahead.

280
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,030
Yes.

281
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Aria's assiduity doing carnal things

282
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,620
made my potency even stronger.

283
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,500
Yes, that's right.

284
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,690
Follow from the most outside part.

285
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:14,860
Right.

286
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,130
She must seduce the emperor.

287
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,940
It's for our mission.

288
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,480
Aria was enjoying pleasing me.

289
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,260
Are you feeling good?

290
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,140
It's good but could be even better.

291
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,230
I'll do my best, so please teach me.

292
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,480
I will do my best to focus my juices.

293
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,300
I'll cum in your mouth, so please swallow it all.

294
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,520
Look here.

295
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,870
In order to maintain this power,

296
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,990
even emperors will prostrate.

297
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:39,150
Aria's lower lips beckoned with such delight.

298
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,820
I'm so happy.

299
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,120
Master.

300
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,500
Aria is happy.

301
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,910
I did it many times that night.

302
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:31,810
I guess this night helped Aria to strengthen her will to be Clarence's clerk.

303
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,780
For my sake, of course.

304
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,520
Yes, I must complete my mission for sure.
