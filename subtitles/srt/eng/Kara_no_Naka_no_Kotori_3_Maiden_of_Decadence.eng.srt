1
00:00:04,298 --> 00:00:05,856
A nostalgic memory...

2
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:08,692
...comes back to a tipsy head.

3
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:12,135
The warmth of soft skin...

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,831
...and a sweet whisper.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,638
It was an old story.

6
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:20,102
For a long time...

7
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:27,009
...I have been trying to rub
an old wound with lost blood...

8
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:28,645
...and...

9
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:31,056
...to forget something.

10
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:37,059
Now I know how
precious the thing I lost was...

11
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:42,795
Hey, you're late Aisha!

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,033
We've been waiting for you!

13
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:46,231
I won't lose today!

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,607
I don't know about that.

15
00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:51,304
Hey, let's start!

16
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:53,037
Yeah, yeah!

17
00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:00,820
I haven't seen you around here.

18
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:04,725
I'm very busy with work.

19
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:06,249
Aisha, come on!
I'm very busy with work.

20
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:07,052
Yeah, yeah!

21
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:10,520
Don't you guys
have any patience at all?

22
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:02,275
Huh?

23
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:12,723
Who brought it?

24
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:16,060
Clair can't go out of the mansion.

25
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:18,357
It can't be...

26
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:47,791
Hey, Aisha?

27
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:50,121
Are you done already?

28
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:52,632
I'll stop humiliating you for tonight.

29
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,758
Be prepared for next time!

30
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,208
These are carnations.

31
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:10,283
You're waiting for a no-show?

32
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:12,880
Nobody is coming.

33
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:15,945
I'm not expecting anyone.

34
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:19,591
I lost again tonight.

35
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:22,856
I don't seem to have much luck lately.

36
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:25,860
What do you want from me?

37
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:30,503
I was just wondering
if I could have a match...

38
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:32,799
...with you!

39
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:39,576
Aisha, see you next week!

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,305
See ya!

41
00:03:41,815 --> 00:03:43,917
Looking forward to it!

42
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:44,542
Okay!
Looking forward to it!

43
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:47,813
Sorry...

44
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:51,481
...but I don't have anything to bet with.

45
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:53,218
It's right here.

46
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:57,225
If I win, you give me these flowers!

47
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:00,458
And if you win...

48
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:04,235
...you can take me as you like.

49
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,270
That's very impressive.

50
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:14,138
Thank you.

51
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,482
Let's play!

52
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,183
I'll keep mine.

53
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:24,081
You're not exchanging any cards?

54
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:24,914
No.

55
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:28,254
Wow, you must have
some pretty good ones.

56
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:29,152
Okay...

57
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,128
Now, let's see yours.

58
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,665
Oh, I lost!

59
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:41,166
I really don't have any luck left.

60
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,801
Well, a promise is promise.

61
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,547
Let's go somewhere else.

62
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:48,842
Hurry up!

63
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,209
Come on!

64
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:51,040
Okay...

65
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,853
I'm Aisha Farfaris.

66
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:06,825
Call me Aisha.

67
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,657
You're beautiful.

68
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:15,394
Thank you.

69
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:47,894
I'm sorry...

70
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:51,761
...but can I stay like this a little longer?

71
00:07:55,435 --> 00:07:58,268
Don't play tricks
on strangers next time.

72
00:07:58,605 --> 00:07:59,299
What?

73
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:00,830
Then, you knew?

74
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:01,972
Yeah.

75
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:04,777
You're awful.

76
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,146
Wait!

77
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:15,582
Hey, wait!

78
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:19,021
What is this?

79
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:22,293
I didn't do it for money!

80
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:24,859
It's for my losing the game.

81
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,428
It's too much!

82
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,636
Take it as your bonus,
since I enjoyed your company.

83
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:33,234
I prefer something more lasting!

84
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,066
I don't like it if it's
the last time with you.

85
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,477
What do you want then?

86
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:39,775
One more night.

87
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,342
In your place this time!

88
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:44,447
Suit yourself.

89
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:46,949
Wow.

90
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:49,421
You live here?

91
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,652
Amazing!

92
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:55,852
Huh?

93
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:00,497
Mr. Foster...

94
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:03,259
Welcome back, Foster.

95
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:04,926
Who is the lady?

96
00:09:05,072 --> 00:09:05,663
She's my guest.

97
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:07,302
Show her a room.

98
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:16,681
Clair.

99
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,548
Yes.

100
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:19,541
Your punishment is over.

101
00:09:20,354 --> 00:09:21,446
Thank you, sir.

102
00:09:22,055 --> 00:09:23,920
I will leave you to
take care of the guest.

103
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:25,925
Yes, sir.

104
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:31,490
Isn't your punishment over?

105
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,565
So why don't you...

106
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:35,664
...take it off?

107
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,500
Ma'am...

108
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:39,036
Please don't...

109
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:43,804
I noticed you were walking funny.

110
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,004
Can I take a look at it?

111
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:47,136
Come on.

112
00:09:58,358 --> 00:09:59,086
Whoa.

113
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:01,658
So, this is no ordinary mansion.

114
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:17,204
I'm coming in.

115
00:10:26,186 --> 00:10:27,118
Welcome.

116
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:28,755
Mr. Foster!

117
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:30,781
Well, it's all right.

118
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:33,359
My, she looks delicious.

119
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:43,960
What a nosy girl!

120
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:01,845
Mr. Foster, this is...

121
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:02,614
Go back to your room.

122
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:42,944
Mr. Foster, it was an interesting show.

123
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:46,148
But she is just a cheap whore after all.

124
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:47,685
I apologize.

125
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:50,886
Well, she's got good
qualities, just change her content.

126
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:00,466
Why did you do that?

127
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:03,472
I felt bad staying here for free...

128
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:05,210
...so I wanted to make it up to you.

129
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:07,773
That's very kind of you.

130
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:10,850
I changed my mind.

131
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:13,779
I'm staying here for a
while, to be near to you.

132
00:13:15,322 --> 00:13:18,189
You are asking to be put in a jail.

133
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:23,322
Oh, I think I am hitting
a jackpot, my prince charming.

134
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:39,773
Mother!

135
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:48,683
Mother, how are you?

136
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:51,150
Very well, Clair.

137
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,457
I'm afraid of Father.

138
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:57,491
Don't say that.

139
00:13:58,231 --> 00:14:00,062
Your father is a very kind man.

140
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,732
Then why does he treat you so coldly?

141
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:08,172
It's my fault, so don't be spiteful of him.

142
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:10,767
Mom?

143
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:13,042
Mom!

144
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:16,347
Wait, please wait, Mother!

145
00:14:16,616 --> 00:14:17,480
Mr. Foster!

146
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:25,221
No!

147
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:44,071
Good morning, Mr. Foster.

148
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,651
Very well, do your job as usual.

149
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:56,020
Yes.

150
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:56,888
Clair.

151
00:14:57,424 --> 00:15:00,120
Today, teach Aisha the basic work.

152
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,656
Understood.

153
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:15,238
You've been here for
a long time, haven't you?

154
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:17,068
Why do you think so?

155
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:21,645
Well, you seem to be trusted by him.

156
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:24,644
He's taking good care of you, right?

157
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:29,046
Please concentrate on your work.

158
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:30,083
Yes.

159
00:15:36,463 --> 00:15:37,191
Clair.

160
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:40,189
Why are you in this mansion?

161
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:45,129
I-I'm sorry if I offended your feelings.

162
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:47,238
But I'm concerned.

163
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:49,371
Is it because of the debts?

164
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:55,374
I sold myself to retain this house.

165
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:56,014
What?

166
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:57,746
You used to be a princess, then.

167
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:02,244
Don't bother, I am a maid now...

168
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:03,920
...just like you.

169
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:08,554
It sounds complicated.

170
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:15,693
Wait for me!

171
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:18,331
Ren, no!

172
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:20,169
It's not break time yet!

173
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:25,335
It's cold!

174
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:48,934
Myuha, how's Aisha's training going?

175
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,431
Well, she's showing some progress.

176
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:53,531
I see.

177
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,908
She always looks so stunning.

178
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:05,074
I even feel bad tying her up.

179
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:09,683
But, it is also a talent
to look beautiful like this.

180
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:20,693
Isn't it too tight?

181
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:24,660
It should be good for her.

182
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:30,131
Aisha.

183
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:35,244
I will teach you what's missing in you.

184
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:37,340
Patience.

185
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:19,989
It's not my taste but
my customer likes it this way.

186
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,587
I understand.

187
00:18:24,564 --> 00:18:25,531
Take care of it.

188
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:48,679
They are very fine candle stands.

189
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:49,447
Thank you.

190
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,823
It's very hard to choose from, but...

191
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:08,574
...l'll choose this one.

192
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,109
Come on!

193
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:32,682
Well...

194
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,356
Don't!

195
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:18,996
Don't touch me!

196
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:20,873
I'm sorry.

197
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:23,867
Don't get me wrong.

198
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:28,313
I'm not angry at that guest, but at you!

199
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:29,614
What?

200
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,614
You don't understand anything!

201
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,112
Foster has special feelings for you!

202
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:40,351
You're thinking too much.

203
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:44,724
Mr. Foster has feelings for everybody equally.

204
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:49,934
I'll get some water.

205
00:21:56,008 --> 00:21:56,872
Clair...

206
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:07,510
I'm sorry, Clair.

207
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:10,520
I said too much.

208
00:22:17,697 --> 00:22:18,288
Foster.

209
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,396
Are you well now?

210
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:23,365
Don't try too hard.

211
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:26,868
I'm...

212
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:29,072
...leaving here.

213
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:42,883
Just kidding.

214
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:46,153
I'm not such a weak woman, you know.

215
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,886
Sorry to disappoint you!

216
00:22:49,262 --> 00:22:52,857
I must say I like you, so I want to stay.

217
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:55,559
I don't ask you to just look at me.

218
00:22:56,903 --> 00:22:57,426
But...

219
00:22:58,004 --> 00:23:00,404
...at least let me stay with you.

220
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:05,535
Just let me stay.

221
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:12,947
Huh?

222
00:23:17,623 --> 00:23:18,851
You are so shy!

223
00:23:20,393 --> 00:23:21,883
I'm not giving up!

224
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:23,525
Never!

225
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:16,235
Any jewel has to be cut and
polished to sparkle its brightest.

226
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,571
So, you might as well get hurt...

227
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,338
...to shine more beautifully.

228
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:26,874
You're jewels in a box, jewels...

229
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:31,079
The last flower of this season.

230
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:32,015
Right.

231
00:25:33,426 --> 00:25:33,790
Ren?

232
00:25:34,026 --> 00:25:34,424
Yes?

233
00:25:34,894 --> 00:25:37,055
Do you know
the phrase of a carnation?

234
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:38,394
Uh...

235
00:25:38,864 --> 00:25:39,558
Passionate love.

236
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,163
Pure love.

237
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,224
I'm impressed, Aisha!

238
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:44,528
Is that correct?

239
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:45,636
Yes.

240
00:25:46,305 --> 00:25:47,499
I'm sorry about yesterday.

241
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:49,339
It's okay.

242
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,242
I have a memory in that flower.

243
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:56,673
Tell me one thing.

244
00:25:56,983 --> 00:25:57,574
Sure.

245
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:05,618
Is the person who loved
this flower somebody you knew well?

246
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:08,787
Yes, very much.

247
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:13,393
It's my mother who loved this flower.
