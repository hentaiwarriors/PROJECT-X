1
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,660
Mrs. Pennel, where is my master?

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,580
I've ordered them to stop searching for Israndia.

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,940
As for the moment, he'll be fine.

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,540
For the moment?!

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,380
It depends on what Prince Charlie would do.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,060
I bet he doesn't like the Israndia's idea of

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,360
sending a half-elf to the Royal Castle

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,500
to seduce the prince.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,360
Uh...

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,900
Normally, the Prince should succeed to the throne,

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,980
but now he must concede it to his younger brother,

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,340
because of the last will.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,080
Then, what about the Prince?

14
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,680
He won't give up on the throne.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,120
This is what people say.

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,760
Then, what about my Master?

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,680
He will be a hindrance for the Prince. And your seduction won't help either.

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,820
Please, stop!

19
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,320
What will happen then?

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,440
I have to warn my Master!

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,740
How?

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,180
This is...

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,180
Israndia will come for you, don't worry.

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,740
Let's think of it. How can Israndia's desire come true without you?

25
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,360
Master...

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,800
Pennel. I can't call her a perverted duke anymore.

27
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,180
Stay at my place for a while.

28
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,540
Why are you so kind to me?

29
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,000
Am I kind? I wonder.

30
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,280
Prince.

31
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,920
Did you call me?

32
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,960
Jack? Get in.

33
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,060
Hello.

34
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,840
So that alchemist who sent a half-elf has run away?

35
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,560
Yes, he has escaped from jail.

36
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,080
What?

37
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,180
Right after a member of the next selection committee,

38
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,820
Pennel, ordered to release him.

39
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,280
That's outrageous.

40
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,820
It's out of my control.

41
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,380
Where is the key, the half-elf?

42
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,580
Pennel took her.

43
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,380
That woman...

44
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,400
So she helps the half-elf to seduce my brother for the throne?

45
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,740
I have no words to say.

46
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,540
So bloodshed cannot be avoided, huh?

47
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,120
What are you going to do to Pennel?

48
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,080
Send soldiers to capture Pennel and the half-elf.

49
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,960
But what about the king's approval?

50
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,480
I'll take care of my brother.

51
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,060
Prince...

52
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm going out to the Castle.

53
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,900
Wait for me, brother.

54
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,100
To kill him?

55
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,240
You'll be the chancellor if I get the throne.

56
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,060
Today is election day.

57
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,180
I won't allow Pennel to do what she wants.

58
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,780
Your desire is my command.

59
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,420
What a nice quality.

60
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:37,960
I can't believe you're a half-elf considering this moisture and grip inside.

61
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,500
Mrs. Pennel, what about...

62
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,320
Tomorrow is decision day.

63
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,520
I have enough influence, however,

64
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,520
the agreement between Yanburikos and Jack is necessary.

65
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,420
That's why I trained you so much; to melt both

66
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,420
their hearts and souls.

67
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,700
Pennel is making Aria her own thing.

68
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,000
Aria, you don't have to be emotional.

69
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,840
Your Master is me.

70
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,680
You shouldn't be trained by Pennel.

71
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,540
Now, train your skin before your appearance before the committee.

72
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
Whoa, what a smell!

73
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,840
What a beautiful smell after the training!

74
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,260
Jack won't be able to resist it.

75
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,100
Hold up, Aria, listen to my orders.

76
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,400
Israndia's life is in my hands.

77
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,960
That's difficult. Even if he'd kill the King, is it possible to retain the kingdom?

78
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,280
No, there is no way.

79
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,880
There is no Minister or General that would submit to him.

80
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,880
Aria, Aria.

81
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,500
Master...

82
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,240
Your eyes are strange! What did she do to you?

83
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,320
After the bath, something still penetrates through my skin.

84
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Something is giving me unbelievable pleasure.

85
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,820
Is it an aphrodisiac?

86
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,160
Oh, during an earlier appearance.

87
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,740
I must praise you to be able to notice my precious aphrodisiac herb.

88
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,340
What about a trade?

89
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,860
What?

90
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:45,220
It's our mutual aim to influence the King's will.

91
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
What do you want?

92
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,200
In order to continue ruling the castle and manage the garden of pleasure,

93
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,240
we must not let Charlie see our breach.

94
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,260
Prince Charlie is the older brother of King Clemense.

95
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,780
I see. Jack captured me by the Prince's order,

96
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,880
to prevent Aria from reaching the Castle.

97
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,840
It seems you've got the situation under control.

98
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,060
So, what is the trade?

99
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,380
A good trade to reach our goal.

100
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,660
Can you tell me straight?

101
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,340
Your true aim is

102
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:40,100
not to gain power by seducing the King.

103
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,060
You want revenge, right? And you'll get it.

104
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,400
I can promise that.

105
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:53,120
If I'm able to get revenge for my guild, what do you want?

106
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,660
The complete falling of Prince Charlie, so he won't be able to rise again!

107
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,800
In other words, to get him under your control?

108
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,380
Something like that.

109
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,860
So your only wish is to maintain the garden?

110
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,500
Yeah.

111
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,220
I was reassured for a bit. Our objectives are quite different.

112
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,760
Desire and struggle.

113
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,600
In exchange for your revenge,

114
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,640
Aria will be my lover.

115
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,140
Forever.

116
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,300
Forever?!

117
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,220
Sure.

118
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,780
Do you need Aria for any other purpose?

119
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,720
She'll be just a burden for you.

120
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:49,540
I was stunned by Pennel. She knew my initial motive.

121
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,360
Do you mind if we conclude the deal?

122
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,340
It's your product so you put energy in.

123
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,600
What about tasting it at the end?

124
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,580
As my farewell gift.

125
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,060
You rascal! You want me to taste Aria?

126
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,520
The secret recipe is what I got from an alchemist when I was young.

127
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,500
Aren't you interested?

128
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,800
Let me be alone with Aria.

129
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,820
You don't want to show me your coupling?

130
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,620
In term of sexual desire,

131
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,440
even Israndia is a mere novice.

132
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,480
Call it whatever you want.

133
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,640
Fine. This is the last time you'll be with Aria.

134
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,300
Take care of her.

135
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,240
Aria.

136
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,140
Aria's whole body is sensitive like her special area.

137
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,280
The last decisive meeting is in the morning.

138
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,160
If Aria isn't selected, your revenge will cease.

139
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,560
Remember that.

140
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,600
Get out from this bath.

141
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,600
It's a mere physical herb with no alchemistic merit.

142
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,120
Aria.

143
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,460
Please, insert it.

144
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,640
I can't wait any longer!

145
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,500
Aria, do you recognize me?

146
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,000
You're...

147
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,460
Aria doesn't seem all that sharp right now.

148
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,840
Her whole body became a sexual organ, and she is distracted.

149
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,240
I can't hold it! Insert it deeper!

150
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,140
In the deepest!!

151
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,380
Aria!

152
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,360
If this continues, Aria's mind will collapse.

153
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,180
I've had sex with Aria, with no emotions.

154
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,140
I had to work hard for it.

155
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,680
It's good.

156
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,380
It's not because Pennel has told me so.

157
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,960
I had to save Aria.

158
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,960
I've concentrated all my mind and body.

159
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,280
I've never done it so seriously.

160
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,860
Aria, do you recognize me?

161
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,680
Master, my Master.

162
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,660
Aria.

163
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,880
I've returned Aria from the critical point.

164
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,200
Tears were falling for some reason.

165
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,180
What?

166
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,120
Brother...

167
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,980
Clemense!

168
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,160
How unfortunate.

169
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,660
You son of...

170
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,920
Master.

171
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,440
Aria, are you feeling good?

172
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,620
Yes.

173
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,200
I do, my Master!

174
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,200
Aria's body returned back to its initial state.

175
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,760
Her consciousness has returned, too.

176
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,520
Aria, do you understand your situation?

177
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,140
Yes, Master.

178
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,060
What is your duty?

179
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,920
Obtain a right to serve the King,

180
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,860
and help my Master get even.

181
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,280
I have to face Yanburikos and Jack in order to do that.

182
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,880
No! I don't remember that!

183
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,740
But they won't choose me otherwise.

184
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:51,580
Why would you do that? I've made goods for them already.

185
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,820
It should be enough.

186
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,580
But that would be the determinative step!

187
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,960
What?

188
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,820
I was stunned because Aria had such a strong will.

189
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:15,260
As Pennel said, in order to please my master, I...I...

190
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,700
I will devote my body.

191
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,220
I've done my best creating Aria similar to a human,

192
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,280
but I didn't give her self-consciousness.

193
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,080
I can't allow it.

194
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,080
King Clemense must be remain beside me!

195
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,180
But then revenge will fail!

196
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,180
I was confused.

197
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,060
Aria is thinking about what she has to do.

198
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,600
We must complete our mission.

199
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,740
Yes, but...

200
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,860
What is bothering me?

201
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,720
I didn't make Aria for Jack or Yanburikos.

202
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,120
Envy? No, that's ridiculous.

203
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,720
The selection committee is present, Aria.

204
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,100
Yes, I'm ready.

205
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,440
Aria, don't go.

206
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,280
Aria.

207
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,220
This smell...

208
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,000
Aria's training is advancing.

209
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:55,380
Do you agree to have sex with Aria and to choose her?

210
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,340
If I could have Aria at least once...

211
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,380
This smell. If I could enjoy it.

212
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,660
Aria, do you agree?

213
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,920
Yes, if I will be chosen.

214
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,040
What a beauty.

215
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,840
Oh, my!

216
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,420
What a smell! It's a perfect smell!

217
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,960
Go ahead! Go ahead!

218
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:46,120
To choose her is your only way to avoid problems.

219
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,620
I will allow you to do whatever you want.

220
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,500
This was unexpected.

221
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,140
Israndia.

222
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,480
Why are you here?

223
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,100
What are you saying after all?

224
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,180
Yanburikos had Aria once in the past.

225
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,780
It's a lie!

226
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,980
You can ask them.

227
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,220
Yanburikos, Aria!

228
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,940
I'm sorry, my Master, but this is for your sake.

229
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,080
It's all for your sake, Israndia.

230
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,900
I felt the worst loss and humiliation.

231
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,260
What should I do now?

232
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,600
I should take a part of the cake, then.

233
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,880
What a good grasp.

234
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,960
Wait.

235
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,600
Oh you...

236
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,220
What are you doing?

237
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,500
Master.

238
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,840
Aria.

239
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,060
Aria!

240
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,820
Aria!

241
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,760
Aria.

242
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,860
Mother?

243
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,260
What's happened, mother?

244
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,840
Your Majesty!

245
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,520
What?

246
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,120
Your Majesty.

247
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,400
Mother, my brother was executed for high treason.

248
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,940
Who is she?

249
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,900
Aria, the next King's aid.

250
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,840
And him?

251
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,740
Aria's guardian, Israndia.

252
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,540
A Master of a former guild; a talented alchemist.

253
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,260
Can you resurrect her, then?

254
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,020
I hope so.

255
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,820
Do whatever it takes and take her to the Castle.

256
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,140
Don't you mind, mother?

257
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,200
Did you like her?

258
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,780
I like her, but I'm unable to leave an heir.

259
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,400
What? He is impotent?

260
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,100
But she'll be a beauty of the Castle, though.

261
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,580
So why did Pennel?

262
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,020
Israndia, you said?

263
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,140
Yes.

264
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,860
It's destiny whether you resurrect her or not.

265
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
Do everything you can.

266
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,180
As you wish.

267
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,880
Mother, my generation will end.

268
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,820
Due to my disease, I have not much time left.

269
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,700
Can I ask you to be a Queen if I won't find a good successor?

270
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,020
Clemense.

271
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,180
I thought Pennel was a pervert who is interested in women only,

272
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,040
but she is a mother of the King...

273
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,380
It's fine to laugh, Israndia .

274
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,880
I had an affair when I was young.

275
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,440
It went on for a long time.

276
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:44,240
So I gave birth to Clemense, and Charlie was born from another woman.

277
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,820
The day that Clemense was born,

278
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,820
the previous King bequeathed the throne to Clemense and died.

279
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,240
I was a servant,

280
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,540
so I earned my living in the castle managing other servants for Clemense.

281
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,740
Then...

282
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,980
Yes, I'm not able to receive a man anymore.

283
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,760
I immersed myself in a paradise of women to forget that.

284
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,000
It was my life. But everything has its end.

285
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,920
Yes, everything is over.

286
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,680
It's meaningless to seek revenge now.

287
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,940
I didn't resurrect Aria.

288
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,880
I had a chance to do it with my skills.

289
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,940
But what would Aria feel then?

290
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,940
I understand it's cruel for her.

291
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,440
Even if Aria will fulfill our plan,

292
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,940
the King has already died, and my life has not ended yet.

293
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,580
Aria will have to suffer alone.

294
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,380
Doura. Eternal Aria's heart.

295
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,680
I've left Albert and Nigred as Aria's grave keepers

296
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,080
and left the royal capital.

297
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,200
Many years later,

298
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:03,340
during my trip, I spent the last days in the small town of Bossa.

299
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,400
This stone's name is Doura.

300
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,080
Under certain conditions, you can plant it,

301
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,180
and charm a person you desire.

302
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:42,400
Master, master!
