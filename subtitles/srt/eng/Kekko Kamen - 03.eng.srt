00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,108
What's the matter?

3
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,779
Aren't you having fun?

4
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,805
Why do you run away from me?

5
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,285
Stupid frigging...

6
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,377
So, how's that? It doesn't hurt, does it?

7
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,811
Aren't you scared, cutie-pie?

8
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,516
You know this is to improve your
academic performance!

9
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,352
Why, no matter what I do, won't
your grades go up, eh?

10
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,479
Why's that, eh?

11
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,991
I really don't know myself...

12
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,527
I really do study as hard as I can.

13
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:38,157
Liar! If you were really struggling,
your grades wouldn't be so pathetic!

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,334
Okay then...

15
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:45,205
You'll change those sloppy study
habits soon enough,

16
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,141
or your cute little body will
be torn in half!

17
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,406
She's going to... She's going to...

18
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,748
She's going to say IT...

19
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,116
Oh yeah!

20
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,584

Takahashi!

25
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,476
You dozed off again, you brainless twit!

26
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,011
No! I didn't!

27
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,171
I'm so sorry!

28
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,550
I'll forgive you this once.

29
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,118
And now, everyone!

30
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,109
We have a new student transferring
to our school today.

31
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,616
My name is Hanoko Tanaka.
It's very nice to meet you.

32
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,325
What a beautiful girl!

33
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,169
Ms. Tanaka's grade point average

34
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,272
at the last school she attended
was extremely high.

35
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:57,232
I expect her to continue to distinguish herself in
the same fashion here at the Spartan Institute.

36
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:02,478
And I sincerely hope you will all do your
very best to keep up with her example.

Hanoko Tanaka - 10,000 Pts

41
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,657
Awesome!

42
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,980
That honor student is so gorgeous!

43
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,384
All done!

44
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,058
Very good. Now you know how to factor.

45
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,693
You did a good job.

46
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,388
Thank you for teaching me.

47
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,127
It's no trouble.

48
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:09,132
I'm just not very good at math.

49
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,374
Hanoko, can I ask you something?

50
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,381
What?

51
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,117
You've only just come to this school.

52
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,415
Why do you help me with my homework?

53
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,746
Why are you so nice to me?

54
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,855
Who else would help me?

55
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,204
Could you be...

56
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,671
Kekko...

57
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,411
Mayumi, are you still awake?

58
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,207
Yes!

59
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,315
I'll be back tomorrow to finish your lessons.

60
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,492
You look strange. What's wrong?

61
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,272
Nothing at all!

62
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:30,982
Grading Notes
- Mathematics -
Junior Class

63
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:35,084
Principal, our success is beyond
our wildest expectations!

64
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,333
It's fantastic!

65
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,836
Tanaka has stimulated the other students,

66
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,037
and test scores are rising rapidly,
oh revered one!

67
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,538
Of course, of course...
and test scores are rising rapidly,
oh revered one!

68
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,095
Of course, of course...

69
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,464
It's to be expected.
I AM a genius, you know.

70
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,581
And how is the problematic
Ms. Takahashi doing?

71
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,415
Uh... Um... Oh, where is it?

72
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,388
Wait one second! Let me take a look at it!

73
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,324
Mayumi Takahashi...

74
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,393
What? She's still at the bottom
of her grading class?

75
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,596
In fact, she's doing worse than ever before.

76
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,689
And her grades are actually getting worse!

77
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,400
I guess there's been no improvement!

78
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,569
None at all? Not even a little
itsy bitsy increase?

79
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,939
That's just not possible! Teacher Ben!

80
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,874
Yes sir!

81
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,809
Summon Hanoko Tanaka at once.

82
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,950
Your grades dropped THAT much?

83
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,919
Yes. I don't know what to do.

84
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,756
I'll be punished again, I know it.

85
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,992
What can it be?

86
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,195
I don't understand this. You are studying.

87
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,497
So what's the problem?

88
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,625
Don't you have any idea why
you can't concentrate?

89
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,623
Mayumi?

90
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,853
I know what it is. It's her!

91
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,435
Mayumi?

92
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,471
Mayumi?

93
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,874
Mayumi!

94
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,020
Everything's A-Okay!

95
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,094
There we go!

96
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,865
Oh, Principal, the Total Tune-up
has been completed!

97
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,002
Fantastic! Push the button, Ben!

98
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,469
Yes sir! Right away!

99
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,701
That's where I thought it was!

100
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:09,604
I'll do it myself! I can't resist!

101
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,152
Poke and listen for the "click."

102
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,036
We did it! We really did it!

103
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,901
The Tune-up worked!

104
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,245
All right! Hanoko Tanaka, a.k.a.
Tougenkyou Unit #1...

105
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,179
What is your prime directive?

106
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,252
To improve all students who perform
below expectations.

107
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,454
Yes, that much you already knew.

108
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:52,754
But what do you do NOW if the targeted
student doesn't improve?

109
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,496
Punish them and punish them.

110
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:00,166
Endless perpetual punishment until
their grades improve.

111
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,398
I am the ultimate punishment machine,
Tougenkyou #1.

112
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:10,209
Exactly. You're an android developed
for the purpose of

113
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:14,646
encouraging students into producing
better grades.

114
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,751
But, I made a fundamental error
when I designed you.

115
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,120
Because of your great beauty,
certain students can't study,

116
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,122
and consequentially, still get bad grades.

117
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,751
That error has now been corrected!

118
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,963
Go forth now and punish them.

119
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,200
Do whatever you wish to those
students who fail to perform!

120
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,868
I expect nothing less than success!

121
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:42,809
Oh, Principal, thirty years of research
has finally paid off!

122
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,979
Yes, yes. I'm a genius!

123
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,651
Tougenkyou #1, you've been given all
the additional powers and skills

124
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,778
necessary for your new task.

125
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,090
Your target is Mayumi Takahashi.

126
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,558
Go forth, Super Punishment Android!

127
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,339
What, really?

128
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,540
No, really!

129
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,142
Miss Tanaka?

130
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,610
Miss Tanaka, please leave Mayumi alone!

131
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,140
What's that?

132
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,351
What do you mean? I wasn't doing anything.

133
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,842
Well, what were you going to do then?

134
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:32,058
Yuka, please stop.
We weren't doing anything.

135
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,794
Don't be such a bitch.

136
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,261
If you'll excuse me.

137
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,238
Why did you...

138
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,207
That new student.
There's something wrong with her.

139
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,608
Don't you feel it?

140
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:55,314
I think you'd be better off not
being so close to her.

141
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,544
What? What're you talking about?

142
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:02,488
Are you jealous because we're getting
along or something?

143
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:07,860
Hey, I'm not jealous!
I'm just worried about you.

144
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,593
The fact is, since she came to this school,
your grades have gotten consistently worse!

145
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,101
But...

146
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,966
I am NOT jealous.

147
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,172
I wish I had big breasts like yours.

148
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,507
Mine aren't...

149
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,142
My shoulders are always stiff
because of these things.

150
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,745
My designer is a pervert.

151
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,813
What?

152
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,440
Oh, nothing...

153
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,086
Hanoko, you... You do have
such big breasts.

154
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,021
Are you HER?

155
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,089
What're you talking about?

156
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,624
I mean Kekko Kamen.

157
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,959
You're Kekko Kamen, aren't you?

158
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,519
That's why you help me, right?

159
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,964
I'd prefer seeing your answers to
listening to this silly babble.

160
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,084
I think I'm probably right...

161
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,381
Shut up.

162
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,791
What's the matter?

163
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,895
All your answers are wrong!

164
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,522
What?

165
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,457
You really are a moron.

166
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,536
You're so cruel.

167
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,773
Here it comes, you pathetic little twit!

168
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:12,301
You're not Kekko Kamen!
How can you be like this?

169
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:17,139
Because she's Super Punishment Android
Tougenkyou #1, that's why!

170
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,285
What?

171
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:26,792
Those luscious tentacles course with
tantalizing tidbits of electricity!

172
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,862
How's that, Mayumi Takahashi?
Do you like that?

173
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,329
No, I don't!

174
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:05,188
Whips! Electricity! Massaging tits!
Three forms of attack at once!

175
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,935
What an irresistible set-up!

176
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:14,840
Yes! I've studied this extreme
combination for over thirty years.

177
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,367
Her grades will improve by
this method... Or else!

178
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,437
Stop it!

179
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,225
Chigusa...

180
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,129
Cease and desist with this vicious cruelty!

181
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,067
What excellent timing!

182
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,370
You, too, will be a victim of Tougenkyou #1!

183
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,907
She's certainly got enough extra
tentacles to handle you!

184
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,576
Teacher Ben, peel off her clothes!

185
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,178
Yes sir!

186
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,373
It's my pleasure!

187
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,551
Oh no...

188
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,798
That's Kekko Kamen!

189
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,066
Kekko Kamen!

190
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,626
Huh? Where is she?

191
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,444
And now, for all of you,
Spread-Eagle Jump!

192
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,239
She's great!

193
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,443
Oh, what a feeling!

194
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,359
The defender of Love and Justice...

195
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,224
Kekko Kamen is here!

196
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,264
Tougenkyou #1!

197
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,233
You've sown much evil in the name of
improving this girl's grades!

198
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,770
Worse than that, you've betrayed her trust!

199
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:56,106
Even though others might, Kekko Kamen
shall never forgive that!

200
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,022
There're too many bodies in here.

201
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,491
Let's take this outside, you
breast-fixated robot!

202
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,325
All right.

203
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,225
Yuka, take care of Mayumi.

204
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,069
Yes ma'am!

205
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,090
Can you escape from my twisted
tentacle technique?

206
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,327
Come on!

207
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,241
Hey, hey! My electrical cables will shock you!

208
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,127
It's not over, not by a long shot!

209
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,177
Not there!

210
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,247
She must have a weakness, but what?

211
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,090
She's got to find a way to counterattack!

212
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,388
And this rain doesn't help either.

213
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,094
Kekko Kamen's only human.

214
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,221
If this fight goes on too long,
she'll be at a major disadvantage!

215
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,167
Come, Kekko Kamen!

216
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,136
Let me take you to heaven!

217
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,244
What is her weakness?

218
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,862
That's it!

219
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,329
That's got to be it!

220
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,468
Your weak point...

221
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,867
This is it!

222
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,465
What?

223
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,411
Here I go!

224
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,539
The secret "Switch Off" technique!

225
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,031
Did she kill her?

226
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,186
I should've known what those
perverts would do.

227
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,622
It's only logical they'd put her
switch on her private parts.

228
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,325
Mayumi.

229
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,223
Yes ma'am?

230
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,130
I hope you continue to do your best.

231
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,830
Yuka, please take care of her.
As always, I'm on your side.

232
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:48,532
On the other hand, I'm a little embarrassed.

233
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,033
Good-bye!

234
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,276
Thank you, Kekko Kamen!
