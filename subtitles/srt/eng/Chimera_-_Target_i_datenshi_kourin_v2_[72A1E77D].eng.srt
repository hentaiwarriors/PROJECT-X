1
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,010
Here!

2
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,810
Happy Birthday!

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,180
Happy Birthday!

4
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,150
Thanks!

5
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,650
How time flies!

6
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,840
Now, blow them out!

7
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,850
Here I go!

8
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,920
Hey, that big shot gangster is here.

9
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,950
It's a pretty sad state
of affairs in Hong Kong...

10
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,790
...when a bastard like
him becomes so important.

11
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,860
Oh, John Roy.

12
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,790
No one in Hong Kong can
stand up to his Ron Tai Group.

13
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,260
Say, who is he talking to?

14
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,900
I'm not sure, but her name
is Rei, or something like that.

15
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,370
I heard she's John
Roy's right-hand man.

16
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,080
With beauty like hers, she
must've seduced him pretty easily.

17
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,980
You know, she's only after his money.

18
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,910
I hear you.

19
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,480
Looks like even
cold-blooded Roy is falling for her.

20
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,190
Man, she's so beautiful.

21
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,750
Hey, don't even think
about coming on to her.

22
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,880
Or you'll be floating in Victoria Bay.

23
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,090
I know, I know.

24
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,290
Nobody knows anything about Rei.

25
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,730
Brave as an angel, sensitive as a devil.

26
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,060
She's that kind of woman...

27
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,120
Rei, why don't we split and
go somewhere, just you and me?

28
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,750
I'm sorry, Boss, but I can't tonight.

29
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,150
I see, that's too bad.

30
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,760
But if you have plans
already, I understand.

31
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,590
We'll make it some other time.

32
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,150
We'll make it some
other time, is that it?

33
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,020
That's enough!

34
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,190
Get lost!

35
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,070
Rei...

36
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,740
I met you for the first time in this town.

37
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,280
You came from
nowhere, you were just walking...

38
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,460
Where's the stuff?

39
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,770
The purest heroin, 999.

40
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,050
From the very moment
you appeared before me...

41
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:42,590
...I saw the perfect beauty in
you, in your eyes, in your lips.

42
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,290
Shit.

43
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,760
I can't believe this is
happening to John Roy.

44
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,490
No good.

45
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,100
W-What?

46
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,570
It's very well made,
what don't you like about it?

47
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,240
Listen, Mr. Wang, do you
know what the real one is like?

48
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,570
This is a joke!

49
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,280
I only deal with fakes that
are better than the real ones!

50
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,120
If you want to do business with the
Ron Tai Group, get the product right!

51
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,080
You hear me?

52
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,580
Yes, I'll get it right next time.

53
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,600
Hey, you!

54
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,970
Sung, what the fuck
were you doing to Mr. Roy?

55
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,730
Stop it!

56
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,830
But, sir...

57
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,840
Kid, why are you trying to kill me?

58
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,840
I know some people
are after me for the reward.

59
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,040
I don't want money, just revenge!

60
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,050
Revenge?

61
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,960
It must've been at least
two days since his death.

62
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,530
What's going on,
doesn't he have a family?

63
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:33,230
His father used to be a pretty
good technician, but he got into drugs.

64
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,530
Well, the rest is the usual story.

65
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,200
You guys killed my dad with drugs!

66
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,540
That's why my mom...

67
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,550
Then she got the easiest
job in Hong Kong, you know.

68
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,250
She must've been an addict, too.

69
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,560
You made her, you Ron Tai
bastards forced drugs into my mom!

70
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,260
That's why you're my
enemy, it's for my mom and dad!

71
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,500
Boss, what are you
going to do with the kid?

72
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,970
You may think it's
funny that I'm being so calm.

73
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,340
But I think he can turn out to be
useful, depending on how we train him.

74
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:27,160
Rei, he's just like I was at his
age, dirty, hungry and living for hate.

75
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,190
I'm the same.

76
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:35,350
No, I think you're too
young to think about a successor.

77
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,290
Yes, you're right.

78
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,700
But, I'm getting old.

79
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,870
It's just that there was another
boy who tried to stab me with a knife.

80
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,500
It was more than ten years ago.

81
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,410
If I didn't remember that boy,
I wouldn't have kept Sung alive.

82
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,890
By the way, the way you
dropped his knife was amazing.

83
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
I was just desperate to protect you.

84
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,730
I knew you've had some
training, but now I'm convinced...

85
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,990
...you're not just an able assistant...

86
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,530
...but a good bodyguard as well.

87
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,640
I want to show you something,
will you accept my invitation?

88
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,130
Sure, I'll accept it today.

89
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,150
It's a nice place.

90
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,720
The windows are bulletproof, to
match the lifestyle of the Ron Tai Group.

91
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,160
Rei, look at these.

92
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,200
How are they?

93
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,700
Beautiful!

94
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,170
It's just so real, maybe
better quality than the real ones.

95
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,910
I see, your
assessment is very accurate.

96
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,180
Now we can do business with them.

97
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,820
I started in the slums, and
finally got into the Ron Tai group.

98
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,520
Drugs, prostitution, counterfitting...

99
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,960
I did everything to gain power.

100
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,730
But, what is this
emptiness in my heart?

101
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,600
Boss, when is the next deal?

102
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,840
Oh, tomorrow night at
2300 Victoria Pier and...

103
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,920
Rei!

104
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,630
You're already my life, Rei, I love you!

105
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,030
No!

106
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,800
Why?

107
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,870
Why, Rei?

108
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,230
I'm sorry, Roy.

109
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,210
I'm still...

110
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,950
If you are having your period...

111
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,620
...I don't want to see
you until tomorrow night.

112
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,620
Rei!

113
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:02,170
Rei, you're either an
angel or a you're a devil!

114
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,410
Boss, my mouth is exhausted.

115
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,830
Yes, understood.

116
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,460
Hey, stop here.

117
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,740
I'm driving tonight, okay, Boss?

118
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,750
But...

119
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,350
Boss, that's not safe.

120
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,510
Yeah, one woman isn't enough.

121
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,420
Don't worry, Rei is the
strongest and closest one I have.

122
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,520
Rei, do we have a little time?

123
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,960
Thank you.

124
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,960
I'm sorry for bringing
you here so suddenly.

125
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,630
Are you a christian?

126
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,960
Do you believe in God?

127
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,830
Believe in God?

128
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,910
No, I just...

129
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,200
I just did so many things
to get into the fast lane.

130
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,410
That's all.

131
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,560
It's time.

132
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,000
The Japanese Mafia isn't very punctual.

133
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,000
You smoke, Rei?

134
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,120
It's not like you said...

135
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,420
Rei!

136
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,630
Rei, are you all right?

137
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,400
Rei, that's...

138
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,340
Rei.

139
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,010
Rei!

140
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,580
I did a basic dressing, but if you
move, you'll start bleeding again, Boss.

141
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,690
Rei?

142
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,220
Rei, what's going on?

143
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,020
Who's that?

144
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,400
It's me.

145
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,200
You?

146
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,100
What are you saying?

147
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,600
It's me dying with you.

148
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,340
What?

149
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,880
You mean you're going to kill me?

150
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,840
Why?

151
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,610
Are you helping that Sung kid?

152
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,220
Sung?

153
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,110
Yes, he pulled the trigger of my heart.

154
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,490
But he has nothing to do with this.

155
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,990
Why, then?

156
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:25,470
Do you remember
the scar on your tattoo?

157
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,770
What?

158
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,630
You are...

159
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,310
You killed my parents on my birthday...

160
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,990
...because my father, a
detective for the Hong Kong police...

161
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,490
...never took your bribes.

162
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,790
Then, it is you...

163
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,160
Since that day, I have been
carrying the cross of revenge.

164
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:13,110
No, it can't be true,
that was a boy, not a girl.

165
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,150
You are a woman, your
breasts are warm and real.

166
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:23,680
They're not fake,
I know you are a real woman!

167
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,810
Then, but...

168
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,980
It was a boy.

169
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,570
You are, you are...

170
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:18,380
Man and woman, and something
in-between, that is what I am.

171
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,520
A hermaphrodite, I understand now...

172
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,790
It's all about revenge.

173
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,260
Then why did you
protect me from Sung?

174
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:43,090
I don't know, maybe because
I've spent a long time with you...

175
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,670
...and wanted to kill you myself.

176
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,800
You'll be the first
suspect if I'm found dead.

177
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,920
That's why that body looks like yours.

178
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,390
Yes, a top ranking member of
the Ron Tai Group, John Roy...

179
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,390
...and his men are all
going to be killed by an enemy.

180
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,990
What happened, Uncle Wang?

181
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,390
You killed Sung, too.

182
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,600
Brave as an angel,
and as sensitive as a devil.

183
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,000
You are amazing.

184
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,770
Rei, are the clothes
I was wearing in this room?

185
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,650
Yes.

186
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,080
Could you get
something from my jacket pocket?

187
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,130
Please, take it.

188
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:22,330
I was going to leave the
organization after tonight, and be with you.

189
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,700
Rei, did you know that
all angels are androgynous?

190
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:36,210
You are my angel,
the fallen angel Lucifer.

191
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:45,290
Rei, as my last wish will
you take me inside of you?

192
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,230
It's so warm...

193
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,960
Thank you, Rei.

194
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:06,470
You made me feel like a human
being for the short time I've known you.

195
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,440
Good-bye, John Roy.

196
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,370
I loved you, too.

197
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,350
I'm happy to be
able to die with you, Rei.

198
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,820
I'm sorry, it's just a double.

199
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,300
You arranged it, just like the real thing.

200
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:02,470
I've been dealing with fakes for a
long time, I deserve to die like this.

201
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,500
The two bodies found at the
explosion were allegedly those of...

202
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,810
...John Roy of the Ron Tai
Group, and his assistant Rei Pikwa.

203
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:51,510
John Roy supposedly had
connections with organized crime.

204
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,720
All of his associates
were also found dead.

205
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,420
The police are still
investigating his background, but so far...

206
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,730
Hello?

207
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,860
Congratulations, I
suppose your game is finished now.

208
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,990
That's very impressive,
and it makes me proud of you.

209
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,900
It was perfect.

210
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,770
Now, will you join my game?

211
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,940
And if I say no?

212
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,880
The evidence of your double
will be reported to the police.

213
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,520
Well, that won't happen, will it?

214
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,910
That's right.

215
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,790
I sent you a gift, it
should be at your door by now.

216
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,690
Test it well and get used to it.

217
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,630
Your code name is Chimera.

218
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,130
It suits you very well, don't you think?

219
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,340
The chimera is a
creature from Greek mythology...

220
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,850
...with the head of a lion, the
body of a goat, and the tail of a snake.

221
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,910
It is a creature with
complex mix in one body.

222
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,140
However, there is
one chimera that is bigger.

223
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,160
Hong Kong was created
from the shadows of history.

224
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,930
A city of chaos with
the essence of the East...

225
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,990
...and the West is the
biggest chimera man ever made.

226
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,040
You will rule the world
of shadow in this city...

227
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,110
...as a reborn chimera with a lost past.

228
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,920
Let's start the new game!

229
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,720
Your first target is the
master of the Rose Garden.

230
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,570
Well, it's getting fun just now.

231
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,390
I'll wake you up.

232
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,240
Who are you?

233
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,010
A new woman?

234
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,760
You came back to me.

235
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,660
I'm so happy.

236
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,370
Please, wait!

237
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,770
Where are you?

238
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,780
Please, don't leave me alone again.

239
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,710
Please.

240
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:11,780
It's you.

241
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,060
Thank you, you really did come back.

242
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,420
This silencer sucks!

243
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,660
It jammed!

244
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,600
Did we get her?

245
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,040
Be careful.

246
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,440
You depend on guns too much.

247
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,510
I see that you're a real professional.

248
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,450
You name?

249
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,050
Why do you ask?

250
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,050
I want to take it with
me to the River Styx.

251
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,420
It won't help you.

252
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,460
I know.

253
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,680
I'm losing my strength.

254
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,510
What's that sound?

255
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:01,390
Is it raining again?

256
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,740
What is this serene, calm feeling?

257
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,420
This is a feeling I haven't had for years.

258
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,750
Rain?

259
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,950
No, this is...

260
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,760
This is...

261
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,040
Are you awake?

262
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,950
Don't move too quickly.

263
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,540
Are you surprised?

264
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,650
My brother found you
unconscious and half-dead.

265
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,720
How long have I been sleeping?

266
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,720
For three days.

267
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,230
I was so worried that
you wouldn't wake up again.

268
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,200
My name is Yung.

269
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,860
My brother is Ron.

270
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,130
I'm Rei.

271
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,240
Hi, Brother!

272
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,440
When did he...

273
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,980
Rei, let me
introduce you to my brother.

274
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,250
This is my brother Ron.

275
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,530
He told me that you took care of me.

276
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,250
Thank you.

277
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,760
You can stay with us
until your wounds have healed.

278
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,770
Then, Rei is going to
be with us for a while!

279
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,000
Brother, did you have dinner yet?

280
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,000
It's ready, so let's all eat together.

281
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,110
Sorry, Yung, I have to go out again.

282
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,010
I just dropped by to check on you guys.

283
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,540
I'll be home pretty late.

284
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,020
Don't forget to brush
your teeth before bed.

285
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:14,030
He's always like that,
he still treats me like a kid.

286
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,490
Don't be so upset, Yung,
I'll eat in place of your brother.

287
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,530
Really?

288
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,230
Thank you, it was delicious.

289
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,540
What's wrong, Yung?

290
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,550
You're very pretty,
you look like my mom.

291
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,540
Your mother?

292
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,750
Yeah, but she died when I was a baby.

293
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,920
I don't remember my dad,
I was raised by my brother.

294
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,500
Do you want to see my mom's picture?

295
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,030
Yes.

296
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,270
She's so beautiful,
she's a lot prettier than I am.

297
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,310
Oh, yeah?

298
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,950
That's the only picture of my mom.

299
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,280
But, you're a lot younger than my mom!

300
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,290
Oh, is that a compliment?

301
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,790
Is this your dad?

302
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,290
I don't know, my brother won't tell me.

303
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,030
Really...

304
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,040
You can walk already?

305
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,090
It wasn't a big deal.

306
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,320
Also, your treatment was very good.

307
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,660
Did you bring a doctor here?

308
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,100
No, the bullet went clean through,
and I know these things pretty well.

309
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,600
I feel sorry for Yung,
but I should be going.

310
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:10,600
If I stay here too long, it will
bring you and Yung some trouble.

311
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,840
You didn't say anything...

312
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,110
...but you saw my body, didn't you?

313
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,280
Yeah.

314
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,880
Not surprised?

315
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,120
I'm used to seeing strange things.

316
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,630
Are you a woman or a man?

317
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,130
That's a mystery to me, too.

318
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,530
I'm giving this back to you.

319
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,310
There's some extra
space in the recoil spring.

320
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,000
You should take care of it.

321
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,140
Who are you?

322
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,140
We're in the same business.

323
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,080
I happen to have a restaurant also.

324
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,250
Yung doesn't know
about my side business.

325
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,480
I won't ever tell him about it.

326
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:01,560
I saved you knowing what you do.

327
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,830
Relax and get some rest now.

328
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,060
Good night.

329
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,330
Good night.

330
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,550
Damn good...

331
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,950
Your gun may be in perfect condition,
but your technique is almost olympic.

332
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,470
It's thanks to you
that I've almost recovered.

333
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,260
This is a pretty good shooting range.

334
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,630
I'm a freelancer, I need to have
this kind of facility to train myself.

335
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,730
Otherwise, I can't
survive in this business.

336
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,900
It's such a competitive business.

337
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,640
You always wear sunglasses.

338
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,390
I don't like to have my eyes seen.

339
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,650
You have...

340
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,820
...nice eyes.

341
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,850
Where are you from
and where are you going?

342
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,050
I don't know, but...

343
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,120
But?

344
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,190
It's my fate, I just follow it.

345
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,510
Oh?

346
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,650
It's a different chain, is this Yung's?

347
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,050
It must be Ron's.

348
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,260
Did you remember?

349
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,040
As you already know,
this is a soundproof room.

350
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,210
In here, nobody will interrupt us.

351
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:09,950
Now you know that Yung and I are
the sons of the Rose Garden's master.

352
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,150
My old man was sane
when this picture was taken.

353
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,520
He was a high ranking
member of the organization.

354
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:23,820
But he was a good family
man to me, Yung, and my mother.

355
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:28,070
I had already started my career
as a hit man for the organization.

356
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,210
But Yung was just a kid
and knew nothing about it.

357
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,940
But when my old man went nuts...

358
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,870
...the organization gave him
drugs and women to shut him up.

359
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:44,880
Then Rose Garden turned into a dead
mansion, filled with insanity and lust.

360
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,680
I knew he deserved
to be killed someday.

361
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,590
But, I should have
been the one to do it!

362
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,730
Do you know why he went crazy?

363
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,670
Since my mother died,
since she was gone forever...

364
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,670
Since then, my old man
wasn't the same person.

365
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,670
Please, don't leave me alone again...

366
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,230
I understand now.

367
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:17,420
I left the organization
and raised Yung by myself.

368
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,180
You understand?

369
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,690
How hard it is to be free from
any group and keep your business?

370
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,690
I have two questions.

371
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,930
We aren't strangers, ask anything.

372
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,730
Why did you cut the
family photo Yung has?

373
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,170
He doesn't need any
memories of his father.

374
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,430
I am his brother and his father.

375
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,940
If you wanted revenge,
why did you save me?

376
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,150
What's the point of taking
revenge on a half-dead body?

377
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,920
Why did you sleep with me?

378
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,860
I thought it was just two questions.

379
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,930
Let me introduce you to Chiney.

380
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,630
She is a survivor
from the Rose Garden.

381
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,140
Her brain is fried from drugs...

382
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,840
...but she can entertain
both men and women, you know.

383
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,950
Let her entertain you for a while.

384
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:36,260
You have a little bit, enjoy your playtime.

385
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,860
You will finish this whole
thing by pulling the trigger.

386
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,130
Say, Brother...

387
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,070
Did Rei really leave us?

388
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:51,440
Yes, she recovered from her wounds...

389
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,210
...and must have her
own problems to deal with.

390
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,550
Did she say she
would come here again?

391
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,720
What's her phone number?

392
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:02,380
She didn't say anything and I
didn't ask, I have to go to work now.

393
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,220
Yung, it's time for school.

394
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,420
I know.

395
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,230
How could you leave us like that?

396
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,470
You're awful, Rei.

397
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,250
Oh, did you come already?

398
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,580
Well, I didn't.

399
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:42,900
You can't just enjoy yourself,
you've got to make me feel good, too.

400
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,040
That's great!

401
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:02,040
Amazing, how did you do that?

402
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,090
The hunter is becoming the hunter.

403
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,290
How is she keeping up that energy?

404
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,740
I envy you.

405
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,150
I wish I had a body like yours.

406
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,480
We're going to do it again and again!

407
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,850
You're going to have to
take me to heaven again!

408
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,020
Shit, why?

409
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:55,630
You bastard, you have both
and you can enjoy it either way!

410
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,260
I can't stand it!

411
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,840
You pay for it!

412
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,190
You don't have to
envy anybody now.

413
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,620
That's it!

414
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,950
I wanted to keep you
alive for a little longer, but...

415
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,630
Don't move!

416
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,970
What's in your left hand?

417
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,900
It's hers, I was going to put it on.

418
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,680
I can't move smoothly if I don't wear it.

419
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,970
You're a guy, you
should know what I mean.

420
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,140
You're very cautious
despite the fact you're going to die.

421
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,980
You won't give up untill the last minute.

422
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,190
Brother!

423
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,220
Brother, what have you done to Rei?

424
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,790
Get out, Yung, it's
none of your business.

425
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,090
None of my business?

426
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,600
What's going on, Ron?

427
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,730
I'm not a little kid anymore!

428
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,740
I even know what your real job is!

429
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,740
So, since when have you known?

430
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,180
I always thought
something was going on.

431
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,150
And when you brought Rei
to our house, I was convinced.

432
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:24,750
A professional hit man doesn't
need a family, it just gets in the way.

433
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,790
Shut up!

434
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,260
Listen, Yung, I'll tell
you why I'm going to kill her!

435
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,770
She killed our father!

436
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,370
Please, no, Ron!

437
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,270
What a waste!

438
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:08,100
You knew what was going
to happen and trapped the gun?

439
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,100
You've only been
pretending to be fooled?

440
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,240
That's a Chimera.

441
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:21,370
You are a quite a
woman, no, not a woman.

442
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,240
But not a man, either.

443
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,310
You are a devil.

444
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,120
Now kill me.

445
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,330
I wasn't ordered to kill you.

446
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,670
I was just trying to protect myself.

447
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,840
You're such a professional.

448
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:51,640
Rei!

449
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,640
Did you really kill my dad?

450
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:06,190
If so, if so, please
don't kill anybody anymore!

451
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,360
Good bye...

452
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,040
Yes?

453
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,520
It's been awhile, I'll tell
you the next target.

454
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,490
I am Rei, she-male sniper.

455
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,250
My code name is Chimera.
