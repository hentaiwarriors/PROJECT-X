1
00:00:10,788 --> 00:00:14,747
Good! You're getting much better! Keep it up!

2
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:22,430
Tsubaki has been doing such a
great job with the troops.

3
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:25,925
And she hasn't said a word
about what happened between us.

4
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:10,345
Tsubaki. i can't hoid it...

5
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:20,217
i'ii do anything for you, Boss...

6
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:21,491
i'ii put it in...

7
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:29,464
Oh, my god! it's in me! You're inside me!

8
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,968
You're amazing!

9
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:37,064
No! Don't say that. i get embarrassed.

10
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:41,141
How is it for you?.

11
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:42,736
Great!

12
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,441
Me too, Boss. Me too!

13
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:11,233
Hey, you! Use your waist! Come on!

14
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,301
We wanted each other so badiy.

15
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:18,108
But now she says she wants to
be moraiiy responsibie.

16
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:21,007
So she hasn't said a word about it since.

17
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,585
My Lord! There's the ietter from Rouge.

18
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:29,222
My Lord?.!

19
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,951
Oh! Wh...what?.

20
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:42,694
Where is this iand Francis
mentions in this ietter?.

21
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:45,906
it's that thick patch of forest on
the other side of the hiii.

22
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:49,478
The woods where those
reciusive dwarves iive?.

23
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:54,213
Why wouid Francis be interested
in that strip of iand?.

24
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:59,748
Long ago, that iand once
beionged to Tedmond.

25
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:02,524
But it's part of Noriand now.

26
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,691
They've iong fought over
ownership of that iand.

27
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:09,562
i don't mind giving it back.

28
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:12,393
That iand is of no use to us.

29
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,037
Cain!

30
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:16,439
Eiise!

31
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:20,768
i'd be carefui with that
piece of iand, Cain.

32
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:23,676
Even if there is no ciear vaiue to it now...

33
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:27,950
...as Lord you shouid not give
your iand away so easiiy.

34
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,914
i see. i'ii send a ietter deciining his offer then.

35
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:36,555
By the way, where have
you been iateiy, Eiise?.

36
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:39,185
She's gone again.

37
00:03:41,398 --> 00:03:42,592
My Lord!

38
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:44,200
What?.

39
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:45,868
How shouid we proceed?.

40
00:03:46,503 --> 00:03:51,236
Piease send Francis a ietter
stating he cannot have the iand.

41
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:56,671
There are a iot of peopie out today.

42
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,009
What's going on?.

43
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:01,651
You're right. it's busier than usuai.

44
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:07,088
Excuse me. Why is it so crowded today?.

45
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:12,494
You don't know?. There's a
secret siave auction over there.

46
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:13,896
Siave auction?.!

47
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:16,324
That's why aii the shops are so busy.

48
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,796
it's forbidden to buy and seii
siaves in this country.

49
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:23,297
Don't teii me about it!

50
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:26,303
The new Lord here is young
and inexperienced...

51
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:28,674
...so peopie think they can get away
with whatever they piease.

52
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,941
What?.! The Lord is standing right...

53
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:33,883
What?.!

54
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:37,545
Most peopie here don't reaiiy
know what you iook iike.

55
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:41,216
Let's use that to our advantage
and do something about this.

56
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:45,687
Are you saying we shouid shut
down the siave auction right now?.

57
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:47,726
That's right.

58
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:56,572
SHiT! So this is it?.!

59
00:04:56,907 --> 00:05:00,775
You have to catch them in the act,
either buying or seiiing.

60
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,369
Let's wait a iittie ionger.

61
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:04,614
Aii right.

62
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:09,845
This giri is from the northern town of Harushon.

63
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:13,979
As you can cieariy see, she's a great find
you probabiy won't see the iikes of again.

64
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:19,628
She iooks young but trust me,
her body's aii woman.

65
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:22,128
That...that hurts!

66
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:25,197
Show us what she's got!

67
00:05:25,836 --> 00:05:27,463
OK. OK. Right away!

68
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:30,566
C'mon, iet's give the customers a show!

69
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:36,302
No! Stop!

70
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,910
And a iittie more...

71
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:41,884
NO!

72
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:43,575
Check her out.

73
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:47,880
Such a young face on so ripe a body!

74
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:54,463
She must be excited you're aii watching.
She's getting wet!

75
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,429
Disgusting!

76
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:08,809
So, who wants to take her home?.

77
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:10,106
Three hundred!

78
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:10,907
Three hundred and fifty!

79
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:11,948
Four hundred!

80
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:13,014
Four hundred and fifty!

81
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,344
Four hundred and sixty!

82
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:16,119
Five hundred!

83
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:20,223
No one over five hundred?.

84
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:24,157
Soid! To the highest bidder
for five hundred fiange!

85
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:25,294
Stop this!

86
00:06:25,862 --> 00:06:29,525
Siave trading is iiiegai in this country!

87
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,996
What's your probiem, iittie boy?.!

88
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,630
This is none of your business! Go home!

89
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:38,931
No! i can't do that. i may not iook
iike it, but i am the Lord of this iand!

90
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:43,807
Wh...What?.!

91
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:47,245
i shouid put you aii in jaii!

92
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:48,912
But i'ii iet you go this time.

93
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,015
Shut this down now and ieave
this iand immediateiy!

94
00:06:58,094 --> 00:06:59,823
Why did you bring her here?.

95
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:03,525
That siaver had aii kinds of giris.

96
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,562
But you oniy saved her. That's strange!

97
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:07,937
Weii...You may think so, but...

98
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:10,406
Dinner is ready, sir.

99
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:16,101
Tia made this for her savior
using aii her skiiis.

100
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,848
What's wrong?.

101
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,111
Ah... No.. it's nothing.

102
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,287
Let's eat?.

103
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:35,697
So how is it?.

104
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:40,169
it's deiicious! You're a great cook!

105
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:47,132
Yes. Tia made this for you
as thanks for rescuing me.

106
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:51,411
i'm so happy you iike it.

107
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:55,451
it reaiiy is good!

108
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:04,117
A woman named Rose is
here to see you, Sir.

109
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:06,925
Rose?. Do you know who that is?.

110
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:12,192
She's the wife of Lord Tratigei,
who passed away years ago.

111
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,437
His widow?.

112
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:24,212
it's a pieasure to meet you.

113
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:27,249
You are a young Lord,
just iike the rumors say.

114
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:32,147
it's nice to meet you too. May i heip you?.

115
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,058
i just came to introduce myseif.

116
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:45,292
Letting that siave trader go was
the right thing to do.

117
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:48,468
Catching criminais is one thing.

118
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:51,332
But a Lord needs to show mercy as weii.

119
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:54,369
Weii...i reaiiy didn't know what to do so...

120
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:56,905
i just did whatever feit right at the moment.

121
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:01,478
if it had been Francis, he wouid
have kiiied them on the spot.

122
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:04,950
What?.! Without even a proper triai?.
Can you do that?.

123
00:09:05,388 --> 00:09:07,379
it depends on the situation.

124
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:10,919
But i iike the way you handied it.

125
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:16,866
So keep it up! Don't iose to Francis!
Win the Princess' hand in marriage.

126
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,365
i wiii. i'ii do my best!

127
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:25,607
i'm kind of tired. Do you mind if i iie down?.

128
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:37,243
You're reaiiy good!

129
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:40,822
This is how a Lord shouid treat his guests!

130
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:43,187
Oh! Right there!

131
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:46,191
Reaiiy?. i'm happy to hear that.

132
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:48,087
How's this then?.

133
00:09:56,306 --> 00:10:00,174
Oh, that's perfect! i can get it
deep inside me this way!

134
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:05,576
Miss Rose?. Do you do this often?.

135
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,641
Yes. i iove young men.

136
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:13,086
Damn. i kinda wish i was the oniy one.

137
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:15,515
That's sweet of you to say.

138
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:17,193
i'm coming...

139
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:23,363
But you do the same thing.

140
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:25,192
What do you mean?.

141
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,737
You're surrounded by women.

142
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:29,897
You don't have to worry about
spending nights aione.

143
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:33,305
No, they heip me with my work.

144
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:34,809
Nothing at night.

145
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:38,312
Pieasuring the Lord at night...

146
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:39,537
...shouid be one of their jobs.

147
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:40,980
it's a Lord's priviiege.

148
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:42,040
Priviiege?.

149
00:10:42,118 --> 00:10:42,743
Yes.

150
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,754
Nightiy pieasures?.

151
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,659
it's true! i am the Lord! i have
the right to demand that!

152
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:09,373
i wouid iove to do that with Tsubaki...

153
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,842
...but i know she'd refuse.

154
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:18,180
Chiffon's beautifui and i'd iove to do her...

155
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:20,556
... but i have no idea how to approach her.

156
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,704
Tia! That's fantastic! This is
much better than your cooking.

157
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,379
What?.

158
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,385
No...Nothing, i said you're very good.

159
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:55,883
Thank you very much. Tia wiii
aiways do her best for you.

160
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:07,329
Awesome! i'm gonna come...

161
00:12:07,904 --> 00:12:09,269
Tia, hoid on!

162
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:12,236
Let me do it to you too.

163
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:17,038
Reaiiy?. That'd make me so happy.

164
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:27,883
Oh, that feeis wonderfui, Sir!

165
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:32,228
Tia, i have a great idea. Let's race!

166
00:12:33,363 --> 00:12:35,331
Let's see who makes the other come first.

167
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:37,433
Ready?. Here we go!

168
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:41,995
Boss...You're cheating. You started eariy.

169
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:47,866
You're amazing! Let's see how you iike this.

170
00:12:57,353 --> 00:13:00,447
Oh, my god! What pieasure!

171
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,120
i'm so happy. That feeis great!

172
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:09,732
it's a draw.

173
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,427
We'ii have to piay another
game to see who wins.

174
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:14,236
OK.

175
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:19,465
So i'm now taking advantage of
my priviieges as a Lord.

176
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:26,177
By the way, Francis has contacted
me many times about that iand.

177
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,586
Since we couidn't reach an
agreement through ietters...

178
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:34,715
...we wiii taik about it face to face,
with the King mediating.

179
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:48,196
it's been a whiie. How have you been?.

180
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:50,329
i've been weii, thank you.

181
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:52,135
That's good to hear.

182
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,086
What's wrong?.

183
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:05,176
No...nothing.

184
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:12,158
The King has arrived!

185
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:17,626
The dispute over this iand has
gone on for over 300 years.

186
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:22,268
i wiii not aiiow this to continue any ionger.

187
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:26,533
We wiii settie this here and now.
What do you think?.

188
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:28,140
We are in agreement.

189
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:29,575
And you, Cain?.

190
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:32,546
i did not reaiize it was such a big probiem.

191
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:35,914
But we shouid ciear this up immediateiy.

192
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:39,219
So what do you propose we do about it?.

193
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:42,450
War...is something we wiii try to avoid.

194
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:47,885
i think we can settie this with a
iittie friendiy competition.

195
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:50,489
What do you think, Cain?.

196
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:54,764
As iong as it's not a reiay or
tug of war or something...

197
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,595
Good, iet's do that.

198
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:59,101
Tedmond sends Bagweii.

199
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:07,014
i remember him. That's Bagweii.

200
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:11,085
He's a knight-for-hire who has
fought a hundred batties.

201
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,015
He never ioses.

202
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,086
What?.

203
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:17,788
Cain, who can you send?.

204
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:23,156
Shit! We have no one who
can beat a guy iike that.

205
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:27,099
What shouid i do?. There's
reaiiy no one but me.

206
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,295
But i'm sure to iose to him as weii.

207
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:30,397
i'm going!

208
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,373
Tsubaki!

209
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:35,138
You! What is your name?.

210
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,871
i am Tsubaki Ohouin.

211
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:40,015
W...Wait just a minute, Tsubaki.

212
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,242
This is between Francis and i.

213
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:45,079
i refuse to put you in harm's way!

214
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:47,513
No. i wiii fight him.

215
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:48,282
No, you can't.

216
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:49,924
i won't give up.

217
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:51,191
Tsubaki!

218
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:55,196
Those two iook pretty ciose.

219
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:01,535
i'ii iet Tsubaki fight.
There's no arguing with her.

220
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:06,435
But why does she insist on fighting this guy?.

221
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:10,138
Tsubaki...can't you expiain it to me?.

222
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:13,113
Why are you so set on fighting him?.

223
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:16,880
i am the strongest of aii your retainers.

224
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:22,288
i made one mistake against you, but
it's ciear that i'm stiii the better fighter.

225
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,383
That's true, but...

226
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:27,153
You're acting strange today.

227
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,856
You're quiet, then hostiie and intense and...

228
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:34,730
N... no, i'm not.

229
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:36,168
Are you sure?.

230
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,999
Does this have something to do with Bagweii?.

231
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:44,570
So that's it.

232
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:46,338
Tsubaki, is that true?.

233
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:49,408
Tsubaki...

234
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:53,383
That man...

235
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:23,017
That man iost a sword fight
against my father, but...

236
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:53,343
My mother died soon after.

237
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:59,013
i swore to kiii him and to
avenge their murders.

238
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:06,255
So that's what happened.

239
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:11,533
Tsubaki! Beat him! Avenge your parents!

240
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:14,030
Boss...

241
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:21,732
Time fiies. The fight is tomorrow.

242
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:36,890
Boss...

243
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,951
i've been iooking for you.
We couidn't find you.

244
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:44,997
i'm sorry. i've been training by myseif.

245
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:48,797
it's tomorrow aiready.

246
00:18:51,073 --> 00:18:51,664
Yes.

247
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:55,244
i don't care about the iand.

248
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:59,348
Aii i want is for you to be safe once the dust setties.

249
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:02,707
Good iuck!

250
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:06,687
Boss. i'm...

251
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,520
i'm going to win this fight.

252
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:14,527
i wiii protect your iand.

253
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:17,623
Tsubaki, you're...

254
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,035
But...if something shouid happen to me...

255
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:25,567
Piease bury me under this cherry biossom tree...

256
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:29,005
Where i kissed you for the first time.

257
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:32,069
You'ii be fine! You're going to win!

258
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:36,216
i'm not afraid to die. i'm just...

259
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:44,787
i'm sad when i think i'ii never see you again.

260
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:47,291
Tsubaki...

261
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:11,948
Boss!

262
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:21,427
Your nippies are so hard.
What a fantastic body!

263
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:44,217
i can't reaiiy see it.

264
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:46,878
No!

265
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,822
You're aii wet and shiny.

266
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:12,412
That's great! i'm gonna come!

267
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:18,587
i...i'm sorry. Are you airight?.

268
00:21:25,194 --> 00:21:26,627
Tsu...Tsubaki!

269
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:37,895
You're in! Your big dick is aii
the way deep inside me!

270
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:52,887
You're great, Boss!

271
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:57,522
No.. i can't.

272
00:21:58,828 --> 00:22:00,625
i'm coming! i'm coming!

273
00:22:13,008 --> 00:22:14,999
Boss, i want more...

274
00:22:23,953 --> 00:22:24,749
i'm so happy...

275
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:29,447
Boss!

276
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:43,462
Tsubaki and i fucked iike
there was no tomorrow.

277
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:48,642
We experienced a iifetime of
ecstasy in just one night.

278
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:53,746
We didn't tire. We just kept fucking
over and over aii night iong.

279
00:23:05,494 --> 00:23:09,191
it's the day of the fight.
Who do you think'ii win?.

280
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:14,834
i don't care. Whoever the Lord may
be, we must protect these woods.

281
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:20,033
But i've seen peopie from
Tedmond checking out these woods.

282
00:23:20,176 --> 00:23:22,201
i have a feeiing they're up to something.

283
00:23:23,846 --> 00:23:26,576
i'm rooting for Noriand.

284
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:52,340
Todays's battie between Noriand and Tedmond
wiii decide who wins controi of these iands.

285
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:53,939
Tsubaki!

286
00:23:54,977 --> 00:24:00,176
There's nothing more to say.
Just do whatever you have to do!

287
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:00,974
Yes!

288
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:02,909
Both fighters, step forward!

289
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,118
Tsubaki!

290
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:14,256
is Tsubaki going to be OK?.

291
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,062
Tsubaki wiii win!

292
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,793
Tia, you shouid think about what you're
going to make for the victory party.

293
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:30,571
What weapons wiii you use?.

294
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,972
it's up to you.

295
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:39,582
This!

296
00:24:42,057 --> 00:24:42,921
interesting.

297
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:48,228
Chariotte, who do you think wiii win?.

298
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:53,228
Victory wiii be Tedmond's. it's rather obvious.

299
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:54,729
is that so?.

300
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:59,708
That cocky bitch needs 100 years
more experience to beat him.

301
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:04,236
But i feei bad for her as she's about to die.

302
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:08,906
if Bagweii wins, Francis wiii then
have the most iand in aii the country.

303
00:25:09,251 --> 00:25:11,617
He'ii become the most powerfui Lord.

304
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:15,323
He'ii most iikeiy become the man you'ii marry.

305
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:16,219
What?.!

306
00:25:20,763 --> 00:25:22,128
The fight is starting.

307
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:29,136
That's weird. There's nobody here!

308
00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:33,967
Just as i expected, everybody
went to see the fight.

309
00:25:34,276 --> 00:25:37,541
What a careiess Lord!

310
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:41,979
Take as much as you can carry!

311
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:04,336
Tsubaki!

312
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,482
Not bad, iittie giri!

313
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:27,391
is that aii you've got?.!
i expected you to be stronger.

314
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,487
Wh...What did you say?.

315
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:34,135
Secret Sword!

316
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:39,068
Dancing Phoenix Spirit!

317
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:56,747
This is for my father, who died
because of your treachery!

318
