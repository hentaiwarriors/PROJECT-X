1
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,270
Princess, I feel like I'm in heaven.

2
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,620
Hurry! Splash your life inside of me right now.

3
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,990
Give me your vigor...

4
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,960
Maya... Are you there?

5
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,440
Come over here.

6
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,110
Y- Yes...

7
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,140
Have you been watching us there?

8
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,310
Yes...

9
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,050
So cute... come to me.

10
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,880
Yes.

11
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,230
I will give it to you too.

12
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,620
There, Maya...

13
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,990
Yes...

14
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:44,805
<i>MAYA</i>

15
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,640
<i>IMMA YOUJO MAYA</i>

16
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,560
If you're a dead body, why don't
you just lay dead on the ground?

17
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,260
I'm too hungry to be a dead body.

18
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,510
I'm Shinbei, a foot soldier
of Katsuyori Abe. And you?

19
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,900
I'm Jyurota, a vassal of
Nobutsuna Mochizuki!

20
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,340
So then we are enemies.

21
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,210
Let's not bring it up. It's not
worth fighting in such a place.

22
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,650
But if you really want to fight,
let's do after we eat the rice ball.

23
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,560
We can't fight on an empty stomach anyway.

24
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,730
Is that all you want to say?!

25
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,500
Hey!

26
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,160
Eat!

27
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,000
So long!

28
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,140
Abe and Mochizuki don't mean
anything to us anymore.

29
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,340
For us, there's no worth in fighting.

30
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,880
See you again if I have a chance.

31
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,950
Hey! Wait! Hey Jyurota!

32
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:40,080
What do you want now?

33
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,750
Do you have any idea where to go?

34
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,925
Not particularly.

35
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,330
I see! I see! I'm glad to hear that.

36
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,570
Have you ever heard about Lord Takeda
in Kai, over those mountains?

37
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,570
Lord Takeda?

38
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,330
Yeah, I've heard he is very powerful now.

39
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,340
People are saying he could
become the next Shogun.

40
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,940
Lord Takeda in Kai...

41
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,640
He might buy my services for a good price.

42
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,350
All right then, let's hurry up and go.

43
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,780
We can reach Kai soon after we
cross over these two mountains.

44
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,920
Excuse me, young men. Are you
planning to cross this mountain?

45
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:40,045
Yeah, we are.

46
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,520
Don't do that.
Stay away from this mountain.

47
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,190
No man has ever crossed this mountain.

48
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,590
What do you mean by that?

49
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,860
A demon comes out at night on this mountain.

50
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,890
She captures and eats
the men who cross here.

51
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,130
A demon?

52
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,410
Are you saying a demon
exists in these days?

53
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:06,840
Hey old lady, don't try to trick us.

54
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,910
I'm not trying to trick you.
This is the truth.

55
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,945
All the men who went to this
mountain have disappeared...

56
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,380
...as if they were spirited away,
and they never came back again.

57
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,120
I'm telling you. Go down to the
base and take another route.

58
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,030
Damn it, I don't care about a
demon or men being spirited away.

59
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:27,860
I don't have time to deal
with such a worthless rumor!

60
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:30,830
I'm in a rush. Hey Jyurota, let's go!

61
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,430
Damn! Weird old crow.

62
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,595
Wait little girl!

63
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,360
Let's have fun together!

64
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,500
You better wait for me.

65
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,610
Nooo! Let me go! No!

66
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,280
Don't resist little girl!

67
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,910
I'll make you feel good right now.

68
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,890
No!

69
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,820
Hurry up and get her clothes off!

70
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,360
I know that!

71
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,300
What's wrong, Jyurota?

72
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,260
Hey!

73
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,900
This is more than we expected.

74
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,810
That tattoo! I can sell her
for a very high price.

75
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,280
Look there, girl.

76
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,160
His thing can take you to heaven.

77
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:07,220
Women go crazy over it.

78
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,730
I'll let you suck it with your mouth first.

79
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,680
Oh... This is so good!

80
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,480
What are you doing?

81
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,890
Let her go!

82
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,565
Who are you?

83
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,070
Who cares. Kill him!

84
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,240
If you let her go now, I won't kill you!

85
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,185
I guess you have some skill...

86
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,320
...but if you kill me now, you'll
end up killing this girl too.

87
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,690
If you don't care, go ahead and kill me.

88
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,090
Coward!

89
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,300
Bandits don't have any honor!

90
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,100
Why are you hesitating? Come on!

91
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,180
If you won't do something, I will...

92
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,710
Shinbei!

93
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,550
They must be the bandits around here!

94
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:27,260
Hey, Jyurota. That demon, the old lady
was talking about, might be them.

95
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,470
We won't cross the mountain until
tomorrow if we keep standing here.

96
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,710
Oh, you're awake?

97
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,620
Don't come near me! Stay away!

98
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,660
And we're the ones who saved her life.

99
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,090
She is still scared. Forgive her, Shinbei.

100
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,730
If you say so... you're the one
who got injured by helping her.

101
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,560
What?

102
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,730
It's just a small cut.

103
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,070
I guess my sword skill was
not as good as I thought.

104
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,370
Oh, please excuse me.

105
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,040
I didn't know that you were
the the ones who saved me...

106
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,780
Don't worry about it, um...

107
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,085
My name is Maya.

108
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,240
I work at the palace nearby.

109
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,550
Please come and let me treat your injury.

110
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,055
My master won't be happy
if I allow the people who...

111
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,620
...saved my life to leave,
without showing my appreciation.

112
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,290
Well, I appreciate it, but we have
to cross this mountain tonight.

113
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,390
Oh, then can you at least have dinner with us?

114
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,600
The Princess will be so glad to have visitors.

115
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,230
Dinner?! Princess?!

116
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,800
Hey, Jyurota!

117
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,875
Don't be rude to Miss Maya!

118
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,650
W- What are you talking about Shinbei?

119
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:44,745
What do you mean, "what"?

120
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,340
Lord Takeda isn't going to run away.

121
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,470
Well... but...

122
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,750
You are so impudent.

123
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,890
How far is the palace?

124
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,490
We are almost there.

125
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,260
Hey... The palace can't be so big,
being in the middle of nowhere.

126
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,630
Here, please come inside.

127
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,100
This is good.

128
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,275
My master will be here soon.

129
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,640
Only you and your master live in this palace?

130
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,310
Yes, my master is the daughter
of a nobleman and his mistress.

131
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,910
She was sent to live on this
mountain for political reasons.

132
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,260
I am Akina, the master of this palace.

133
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,210
I heard that both of you saved my servant.

134
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:53,040
Thank you very much.

135
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,930
I would like to show a little appreciation.

136
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,270
Please stay here and relax overnight.

137
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,320
I never expected I could meet such
a beautiful princess in this area.

138
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:08,920
What luck!

139
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,520
I will take the princess.

140
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,430
What?

141
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,960
You fool! They've been hiding on
such a secluded mountain, all alone.

142
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,060
That means they haven't
had a man for a long time.

143
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,330
You don't mean...

144
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,740
Why don't you take Maya.
Don't you like her?

145
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,740
W- Well...

146
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,840
All right! So we're in agreement!

147
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,480
Princess, I'm coming for you.

148
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,950
See you later.

149
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,490
Princess Akina, I won't
let you sleep tonight!

150
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,390
Hey! Wait, Shinbei!

151
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,950
Ouch...

152
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,500
May I wash your back?

153
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,420
Miss Maya.

154
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,970
Jyurota! What is wrong?

155
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,700
Is your wound hurting?

156
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,200
I guess the hot water made my wound reopen.

157
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,200
Oh, your cut...

158
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,810
Miss Maya.

159
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,460
Jyurota...

160
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,640
Miss Maya.

161
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,140
I see the moon has graciously
hidden behind a cloud.

162
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,720
Oh... Who is it? Is anybody there?

163
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,965
Cats don't live on this mountain.
It must be cold outside.

164
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,130
Why don't you come inside, and have
sake to make yourself warm, Shinbei.

165
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,170
Ahhh. You've got me.

166
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,500
I can't fool you, Princess Akina.

167
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,520
It's really cold outside.

168
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:14,540
Oh! Sake?

169
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,320
Huh? You don't have sake cups here.

170
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:19,150
Oh! I'll go and get some!

171
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,920
No need to do that. The cup is right here.

172
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,910
Here, Shinbei, drink up now.

173
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,965
Oh, yes! Suck everything.

174
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,060
It's dripping deeply inside of me!

175
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,110
Princess Akina!

176
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,020
Jyurota...

177
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,210
Miss Maya.

178
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,650
Jyurota...

179
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,750
How big and strong it is!
Please give it to me. Please.

180
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,080
Well, It's my turn.

181
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,090
This is too good, Princess...

182
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,340
P- Princess!

183
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,820
It's still hard like this... Now, Shinbei...

184
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,330
Princess Akina.

185
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,570
Have you been living with the
Princess all your life?

186
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,660
Yes.

187
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,710
Don't you feel lonely,
just the two of you being here?

188
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,710
Don't you ever feel like leaving this mountain?

189
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,670
I can't leave this mountain.

190
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,390
That's my fate.

191
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,690
Fate?

192
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,580
Is that something to do with this tattoo?

193
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,250
Is that why you can't be free from the Princess?

194
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,990
Maya...

195
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,700
Jyurota, I like you.

196
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,230
So... please leave this mountain!

197
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,630
You have to get out of here
as quickly as possible!

198
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,240
Maya! Wait.

199
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,170
Maya! I like you too...

200
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,250
Damn it...

201
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,440
Stop it!

202
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,560
<i>It can't be...</i>

203
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,170
A- Are you...

204
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,940
Shinbei, is that you?!

205
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,740
Jyurota...

206
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,510
Get away from here... A monster...

207
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,020
A monster?

208
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,530
I guess you finally found
out who I am, young boy.

209
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:46,200
This is a palace of cobwebs
to capture men like you.

210
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,875
I absorb the life-energy of
the men who visit here.

211
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,900
Then, I turn the men into spiders
after taking their life-energy.

212
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,510
Come to me. It's your turn.

213
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,190
Let me be fulfilled by your young vigor.

214
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,870
M- Maya!

215
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,540
Escape from here now!

216
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,340
Maya...

217
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,280
Please, go now!

218
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,550
What happened to you, Maya?

219
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,580
Don't come near me!

220
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,290
Maya, take him now.

221
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,860
No. I'm... I'm...

222
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,265
What are you going to do?

223
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,990
Do you think you can leave with this man?

224
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,800
You know very well that you
will never be able to do that.

225
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,170
L- It's...

226
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,300
Maya, give me the spear!
I will take care of this monster...

227
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,770
No!

228
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,490
The... tattoo!

229
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,980
Please, Princess Akina...

230
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:23,960
You can do anything to me!

231
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,300
Just don't hurt Jyurota... Princess Akina!

232
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,260
Oh, there, there. You are getting so big.

233
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,560
Maybe it's because you
have Maya's young vigor.

234
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,940
But Maya is in love with this man,
and is trying to leave you.

235
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:36,280
And she even aimed a spear at me...

236
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,150
...the person who raised her after
she was abandoned on the mountain.

237
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,720
Yes, just like me...

238
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,450
I was left on this mountain.

239
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,025
I'm the child of a noble's mistress.

240
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,360
I didn't even know I was being abandoned.

241
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,930
They took me out from the house and
separated me from my foster parents.

242
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,590
I had to move to this mountain alone.
But that was not everything...

243
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:30,100
The men who were supposed to
guard me took advantage of me...

244
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,390
They raped me over and over.

245
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,370
When I came to, I was walking
on the mountain by myself.

246
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,100
And then...

247
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,320
I saw eyes staring at me in the darkness.

248
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,050
The eyes asked me,

249
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,590
"Do you want to take revenge
against all the men in the world?"

250
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,560
I nodded, and made a deal with it.

251
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,100
I made love with the demon.

252
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:12,530
It was a mysteriously erotic moment.
As if I was in another world.

253
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,810
And I...

254
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,150
I gained the magical power
to take men's life-energy.

255
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,220
I turned all the men who
raped me into spiders.

256
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,050
Then I turned all the men
who visited here into spiders.

257
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:37,000
And one day, I found you on the mountain.

258
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,370
I wanted for you to succeed me.

259
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,130
To continue my revenge against men.

260
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,510
I placed the tattoo of the forest
demon on your back, and raised you.

261
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,670
How can you do this to me?

262
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,180
Look Maya. I will show you what a man is like!

263
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,160
Absorb the life-energy from Maya
that she just got from him.

264
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,420
If you really like Maya, you
must be able to take anything.

265
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,640
<i>N- No. I can't let her do this.</i>

266
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,170
<i>How can I reach there?
I need to get that spear.</i>

267
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:45,120
You are taking it pretty well, but
I wonder how long you'll last?

268
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,720
How is it? Aren't you feeling good inside of me?

269
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,640
You don't have to hold it in.

270
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,910
Let your life pour out, inside of me.

271
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,680
Here, suck it. Here... Here...

272
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,220
That's good. Yes that's it!

273
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,490
Maya, did you see it?

274
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,870
The man that you love just splashed
lots of his life inside of me!

275
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,785
See? Now you must understand
what a man is like.

276
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,250
They will take any woman
just as long as it's a woman!

277
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,450
What?!

278
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,170
Damn it! Get off of me!

279
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,770
You bastards! Trying to kill me!

280
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,560
You bastard!

281
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,570
Why? Why do men take
everything away from me?

282
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,170
Maya! Maya!

283
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,470
Maya!

284
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,320
Maya, the spear! Give me the spear!

285
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,480
Jyurota!

286
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,210
Maya! Stop!

287
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,350
Jyurota...

288
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,600
Maya!

289
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,700
I'm glad, Jyurota...

290
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,440
Maya!

291
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,290
Please don't die, Maya.

292
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,730
It's time to for me to go...

293
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,190
What are you talking about?

294
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,960
But, I'm happy.

295
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,470
The demon on my back is
gone, and I'm clean now.

296
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,180
You helped me, Jyurota.

297
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,880
Maya.

298
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,740
Can you hold me again before I die?

299
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,120
Maya...

300
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:18,530
After that, the girl who had the demon
woman's tattoo on her back...

301
00:40:18,565 --> 00:40:20,035
...became the demon.

302
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,330
Now, she captures men crossing
this mountain and eats them.

303
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,800
On this mountain?

304
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,140
And is the girl who became
the demon is good looking?

305
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,285
She becomes young every time
she takes a man's life...

306
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,650
...and she has been living for a few
hundred years on this mountain.

307
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,855
That sounds good!

308
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,520
I can let her take me!

309
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,420
Well, let's punish her with
the swords in our pants!

310
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,760
Then, I'll go first.

311
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,190
Hey, I'll go first!

312
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,900
Even now, men will never learn.
