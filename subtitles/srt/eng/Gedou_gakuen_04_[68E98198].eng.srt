1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,200
You, too, will give a
bit of your blood...

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,900
for the resurrection
of the demons!

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,810
What's happening?

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,980
What began for Masao Sera with
the great Himalayan earthquake,

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,510
now continues in the
violence of "Nightmare Campus."

6
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,700
It's all going as we planned.

7
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,430
Appearing suddenly,
the mysterious...

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,800
and handsome young man,
Shuichi Kusanagi,

9
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,170
and the campus
doctor, Dr. Mikogami,

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,830
have taken control of the school
and are driving the gangs out.

11
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,710
Masao and his gang
are the main targets.

12
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,580
Besides this, a strange
effect gave the...

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,490
martial arts club
superhuman abilities...

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,120
and their fight with Masao
and his friends grew severe.

15
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,560
STOP IT!!!

16
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,100
Amidst the tumult, Masao lost
the last of his reservations...

17
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,910
and allowed the demon lord
Esedess to fully join with him.

18
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,520
I follow the ancient
link of destiny...

19
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,080
and stand upon
the earth once more!

20
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,970
Guess you're on our side now.

21
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,140
But then,
as though to mock them...

22
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,950
Kusanagi and Mikogami
appeared in their true forms.

23
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,620
We'll be taking
your friend as well.

24
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,560
Wait!

25
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,980
Seeing the two of them left
Masao shaking with fear.

26
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,980
Our enemies... The Gods?

27
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,060
When the ancient seal of
the Gods is opened...

28
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,230
the earth will once again
be covered by the fires of hell.

29
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,070
Evil spirits will dominate...

30
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,370
and men's souls
will rot with evil.

31
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,910
The earth will be drowned
in an ocean of blood...

32
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,410
and the flames will rise
up to scorch the heavens.

33
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,750
Civilization will
lose all reason...

34
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,760
and human society will
collapse beyond recognition.

35
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,790
But do not be saddened by
this, children of man.

36
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,090
Rather than destruction,
it shall be a beginning.

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,000
New life will be brought
to your decrepit world.

38
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,430
But it shall be life born in
pain, and all living things...

39
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,700
will be crucified on
the cross of fate.

40
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,370
Amidst this chaos, the true
nature of the world...

41
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,140
will be revealed in whole and
its true form shall be restored.

42
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,840
When this happens, man will,
for the first time...

43
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,820
be freed of the yoke of the old
gods and regain self-determination.

44
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,080
Many have tried,
but none can escape...

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,020
the destiny that
is called evolution.

46
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,060
The king of the underworld,
awakened from his long sleep...

47
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,100
tempts mankind towards chaos.

48
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,130
Here, human history ends.

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,170
A new age of
life is beginning.

50
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,920
Stop it! Stop it, please!

51
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,870
I still don't understand.

52
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,840
Why are you still doing
this to Akira Mido?

53
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,430
He's already fallen into our
trap. There's no threat now.

54
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,270
We hold his fate in our hands.

55
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,720
I know we're using him in
another feint against Esedess...

56
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,950
but why supply
him with those women?

57
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,890
Isn't it time you told me?

58
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,620
What exactly is this plan
supposed to accomplish?

59
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,130
It seems to me you're uselessly
trying to stimulate him...

60
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,900
for the sake of
your own amusement.

61
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,730
Kusanagi!

62
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,740
Forgive me!
I spoke carelessly!

63
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,410
Understand this: A low-level
God like yourself...

64
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,240
doesn't need to know the plan.

65
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,520
All you need concern yourself
with is hunting them...

66
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,110
just as you've been doing.

67
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,690
Make Esedess suffer utterly
and then bring me his head!

68
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,520
Yes, my lady!

69
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,290
Yes... I need them even
more than I need you.

70
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,990
Their young, vibrant lives!

71
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,280
Stop it!

72
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,620
Save me, Masao!

73
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,050
Where...?

74
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,050
Father!

75
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,390
Mo... ther...

76
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,640
Ah, young man. Still not dead?

77
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,580
Then I'll keep on killing you.

78
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,720
Just like this one!

79
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,820
Aquifel!

80
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,930
Sleep in eternal
darkness, Esedess!

81
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,460
Taste the benevolence
of the Gods!

82
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,450
Thanks to you, the gang sweep
has been a spectacular success.

83
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:28,120
We pray that decency will soon
be returned to this campus.

84
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,280
We want all of you to help us.

85
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,260
Let us fight together,
for the future of our campus!

86
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,430
Miss Someya.

87
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,470
Why don't you accept my baptism?

88
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,770
He'll only bring you pain.
You're being deceived by him.

89
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,510
Who are you people?

90
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,680
We are they
who speak the truth.

91
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,520
If you wish to know the
truth, then come to us.

92
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,520
We will remove any
doubts you may have.

93
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,430
So, you're still conscious.

94
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,440
You apparently deserve
your title of demon lord.

95
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,410
You monster!

96
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,910
This warm pulsation is a
feeling we Gods lost long ago.

97
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,720
Now, let your warm
life force flow into me.

98
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,700
Just kill me!
Why humiliate me like this?

99
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:53,870
I desire a strong man, like you.
And like the other young man.

100
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,270
Damn it, what are you up to?

101
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,710
You want to kill
we demons because...

102
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,180
we broke free
of the seal, right?

103
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,690
We Gods created that seal.

104
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,320
Only we could have broken it!

105
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,620
That... That's insane!

106
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,100
YOU were the ones
who broke the seal?

107
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,130
Then what was the
point of the war?

108
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,230
That long, terrible war!

109
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,690
You cursed us by burying us
in the cold, dark earth...

110
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,500
for what seemed
like an eternity.

111
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,510
And now you finally allow
us back into the light...

112
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,520
simply so you
can amuse yourselves?

113
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,070
Answer me, God!

114
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,320
You wish to know the truth?

115
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,150
More than anything!

116
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,810
Then I will tell you.

117
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,350
It can't be...!

118
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,590
Don't.

119
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,600
You can't go back,
now that you know the truth.

120
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,780
Knowing what you do,
choose life or death.

121
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,270
If you wish to live...

122
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,720
Yes... That's the way,
demon lord Aquifel.

123
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,700
Faithful servant of the Gods.

124
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,670
Masao! Masao!

125
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,370
Shut up, you little shit!

126
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,720
Masao?

127
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,520
Masao, what are you doing?

128
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,470
At this rate they'll
take over the campus.

129
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,130
You're playing into their hands!

130
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:16,970
I'm scared. That she'll...
That she'll kill me again!

131
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,740
I think of Akira, and...!

132
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,740
Bullshit! You're the demon
lord Esedess, right?

133
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,760
Pathetic!

134
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,430
Just cowering in there!

135
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,000
They're planning
to expel the gang...

136
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,900
at tomorrow's campus assembly.

137
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,940
The odds are bad,
but we're gonna fight them!

138
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,100
We'll take some of them with us!

139
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,780
Masao?

140
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,120
Yuuko...

141
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,150
Hi.

142
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,990
What happened? You're hurt!

143
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,730
Oh, I see.

144
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,860
Yeah. Pretty pathetic, huh?

145
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,170
But I understand how Abe feels.

146
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,510
The campus has changed.

147
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,140
It was almost better when
they were fighting all the time.

148
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,710
If you don't do something...

149
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,880
I can't do it.

150
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,990
Stop it! Masao,
get a hold of yourself!

151
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,190
What?
Is something wrong, Yuuko?

152
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,770
Please, go back to
being strong. Help me!

153
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,170
Otherwise, I'll...

154
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,680
I'm afraid I'll change, too.

155
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,180
Yuuko...

156
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:15,990
Make love to me.

157
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,250
I'm sorry.

158
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,560
Masao!

159
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,890
It's all right.
Just hold me like this.

160
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,170
I thought you'd come.

161
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,630
What's wrong? Come in!

162
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,880
Stop it!
What are you doing?

163
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,880
What's the problem?

164
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,550
You came because you
have doubts, didn't you?

165
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,320
I'm going to remove them!

166
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,220
Take my baptism and
become my soul slave!

167
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:57,960
No!

168
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,630
Did that little demon
give you this scar?

169
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,130
It will never heal clean.

170
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,570
That little coward
drove you here.

171
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,510
So long as you carry that scar,
he will never make love to you.

172
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,580
That's it, isn't it?

173
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,640
He couldn't return
your love, could he?

174
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,470
No!

175
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,280
Wretched creature.
Your words reject me...

176
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,010
but your body
is much more truthful.

177
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,460
So, this is Esedess'
beloved woman?

178
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,590
She'll make a fine diversion.

179
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,530
I'm glad you came, Miss Someya.

180
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,700
Now you belong to us.

181
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,370
Akira!

182
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,810
No!

183
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,280
Her love juices
taste like our own.

184
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,290
No!

185
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,420
As I thought.
Allow me to fully awaken her.

186
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,130
Masao, forgive me!

187
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,460
Well, I'm going.

188
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,070
You're really doing this?

189
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,130
Yeah.

190
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,940
It's impossible! Even if
Esedess could fight...!

191
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,180
If I don't come back,
get outta town. Got that?

192
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,860
What? I thought you'd turned
chickenshit and weren't coming.

193
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,770
Will you let me come with you?

194
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,710
No backing out, okay?

195
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,680
Right.

196
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,820
We are the outsiders.

197
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,880
The ones who have turned away
from the "decent" path.

198
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,260
No matter who the enemy is,
there's no excuse for running.

199
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,920
As long as we live,
this world is ours!

200
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,160
Now, let's take back our
campus from those lousy Gods!

201
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,830
Go get 'em, Boss!

202
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,840
- We'll slaughter 'em!
- Keep at it!

203
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,100
There's nothin'
to be scared of!

204
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,800
You're the demon
lord Esedess, right?

205
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Because of the importance
of the announcement...

206
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,450
to be made at today's
campus assembly...

207
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,580
all students are
required to attend.

208
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:57,220
Anyone absent without reason
will be punished severely...

209
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,560
for failure to appear!

210
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,800
Repeat, because of the
importance of the announcement...

211
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,030
to be made at today's
campus assembly...

212
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,440
all students are
required to attend.

213
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,980
Anyone absent without reason
will be punished severely...

214
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,720
Outta the way! Yuuko!

215
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,660
Yuuko!

216
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,330
Dammit, move! Out of my way!

217
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,570
Uh-oh, Kusanagi's got
'em all brainwashed!

218
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,700
Ladies and gentlemen!

219
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,080
There is only one reason I
have called you together today.

220
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,950
It was to reveal a truth
which must be told.

221
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,390
We of the student council
and the discipline squads...

222
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,290
have been working hard to
clean up this campus...

223
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,130
and restore its
tarnished name!

224
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,570
You all know which group is
responsible for ruining it!

225
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,110
It is the group we refer
to as the outsiders!

226
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,970
I believed sincerely
that our duty was...

227
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,670
to find a way to expel these
disruptors of our academic life!

228
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,310
However, in the
course of doing this...

229
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,320
we discovered
a shocking truth!

230
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,690
It is a truth which seems
to defy common sense...

231
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,060
but, as the truth.
It must be faced!

232
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,560
To confess this truth,
I have brought a witness:

233
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,390
Akira Mido!

234
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,730
Akira!

235
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,840
I stand before you all because
I must confess my shame!

236
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,680
Because I must confess it for my
best friend who stands here now.

237
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,410
It's something
I deeply regret doing.

238
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,020
When I saw that my friend,
presumed dead in the...

239
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,110
great Himalayan quake,
had returned safely...

240
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,350
I was naturally overjoyed.

241
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,860
But he wasn't the
friend I remembered!

242
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,690
Ever since he returned...

243
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,030
strange things have
occurred on this campus.

244
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,040
And, against my better
judgment, I became involved.

245
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,040
And now...

246
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,870
Akira!

247
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,800
Look at me!
This horrible form!

248
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,390
He began with me and
gave many other students...

249
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,230
similarly hideous
bodies and powers...

250
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,770
so that he could
make the school his own!

251
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,900
Masao Sera! He is...

252
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,470
a demon!

253
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,280
Demons... Demons... A demon...

254
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,770
Yes! Drive them
from the campus!

255
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,000
Careful, Masao.

256
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,770
Shit, there's no end to them!

257
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,010
I'll kill that son of a bitch!

258
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,720
Don't! It's too dangerous!

259
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,790
What?

260
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,650
So, you reveal your
true form at last, Esedess!

261
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:50,820
Kill him! He isn't human!
Killing him isn't a sin!

262
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,080
Kill him!

263
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,890
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

264
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,160
Sorry, Masao.
You did that to save me!

265
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:03,070
Forget it! They were going
to try to kill us eventually!

266
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,620
Fight, you lowly worms!

267
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,220
Shit!

268
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,920
You've served your purpose.

269
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,750
Akira!

270
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,760
Guys, clear a path!
I'm taking him down!

271
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,260
Gotcha! Okay, guys!
Full power!

272
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,940
Come on, Masao!

273
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,280
Right!

274
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,620
What?

275
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:12,300
What's wrong? Try and breach
this wall of light to strike me!

276
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:18,640
You can't! Even the demon lord
Esedess is no match for me!

277
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,610
Fear me, demonic creatures!
Fear the light of my holy power!

278
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,600
We're in trouble!
Masao, do something!

279
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,260
Back! Back to your
eternal darkness!

280
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,720
In the name of justice,
we fight by your side!

281
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,260
Kano!

282
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,430
Asshole! Just had to wait
for the climax, didn't you?

283
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,440
Yuuko!

284
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,840
Damn you!

285
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,080
Look! Look! So hard,
even though she's unconscious.

286
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,920
KUSANAGI!

287
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,960
Masao...

288
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,590
Yuuko!

289
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,330
What's wrong, Masao?
Don't you want to kill me?

290
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,070
Follow me and I'll show
you something interesting.

291
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,750
Follow Masao!

292
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,850
They're trying
to slow us down!

293
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,230
Why don't you fight THESE?

294
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,530
Kusanagi!

295
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,220
Out of my way!

296
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,250
There you are!

297
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,550
Quite a fix, Esedess.

298
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,820
Try as you might,
you can't move in there.

299
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,830
Observe!
My magnificent form!

300
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:31,170
A demon like you may find it
difficult to gaze upon my glory!

301
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,110
Now bow at my feet...

302
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,200
and beg forgiveness for
your hideous form, Esedess!

303
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:48,520
Sacrifice your soul
and praise me with joy!

304
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,460
Do that and this woman's
doubts will be cleared away.

305
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,460
She has now accepted
the love of the Gods.

306
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:00,190
Her body can never
accept a demon like you.

307
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,100
I'll tell you why, Esedess.

308
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:08,630
She is one of us!
One of the Gods!

309
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,750
You're lying!

310
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,810
Why are you so surprised?

311
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,510
This is only the truth, Esedess.

312
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,150
I will say this in
her defense, though:

313
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,360
She wasn't lying in
order to get close to you...

314
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:31,020
because she didn't even
suspect the truth herself!

315
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,900
Yuuko!

316
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,510
It seems she's chosen to be
with her own kind...

317
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,110
rather than with a
filthy "thing" like you.

318
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,240
Tell me, do you want this?

319
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,460
Yes! Yes!

320
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,460
You son of a bitch!

321
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,130
Behave.

322
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,170
Esedess, she's chosen
me instead of you.

323
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,180
Accept the truth!
Although, the funny thing is...

324
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:28,210
the thing that made her
your greatest weakness...

325
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:31,620
wasn't even her
godly blood, was it?

326
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,560
What's wrong? Are you crying?

327
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,960
Accept the truth, coward!

328
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,970
Well, let me show you something
even more interesting!

329
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,800
She'll prove she does this
willingly! Now start!

330
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,420
This is her true face!

331
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,660
Moan for me,
like you did last night!

332
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,380
What the...?

333
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,580
That scream...

334
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,810
Cry! Scream, Esedess!

335
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:52,730
Ma... sa... o...!

336
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,110
Masao!

337
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,620
Shut up! Shut up!

338
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,720
KUSANAGI!!!

339
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:50,090
Impossible... How could
a demon... have beaten me...?

340
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,770
Yuuko...

341
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,140
No!

342
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,780
Please, stay away...

343
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,780
Yuuko...!

344
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,120
Please...

345
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,470
Miss Someya.

346
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,070
Come.

347
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,810
Doctor!

348
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,640
Yuuko!

349
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,480
Train yourself more, young man.

350
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,810
No, wait!

351
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,330
Yuuko! YUUKO!!!

352
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,590
What's that?

353
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,720
Masao...

354
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,370
Something's changed inside him.

355
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,980
Masao, you're not...!

356
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,480
You're not going to destroy
the world again, are you?

357
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,550
Say you won't!

358
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:03,160
You aren't the old Esedess!
You're Masao Sera, right?

359
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,560
So, please! Please!

360
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,110
When the ancient seal of
the Gods is opened...

361
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,280
the earth will once again
be covered by the fires of hell.

362
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,120
Evil spirits will dominate...

363
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:38,420
and men's souls
will rot with evil.

364
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,960
The earth will be drowned
in an ocean of blood...

365
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,460
and the flames will rise
up to scorch the heavens.

366
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,790
Civilization will
lose all reason...

367
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,800
and human society will
collapse beyond recognition.

368
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,840
But do not be saddened by
this, children of man.

369
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,140
Rather than destruction,
it shall be a beginning.

370
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,040
New life will be brought
to your decrepit world.

371
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,480
But it shall be life born in
pain, and all living things...

372
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,750
will be crucified on
the cross of fate.

373
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,410
Amidst this chaos, the true
nature of the world...

374
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:13,190
will be revealed in whole and
its true form shall be restored.

375
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,890
When this happens, man will,
for the first time...

376
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,870
be freed of the yoke of the old
gods and regain self-determination.

377
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,130
Many have tried,
but none can escape...

378
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,070
the destiny that
is called evolution.

379
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,110
The king of the underworld,
awakened from his long sleep...

380
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,150
tempts mankind towards chaos.

381
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,180
Here, human history ends.

382
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,220
A new age of
life is beginning.
