1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,820
l'm Kenta Ochiai.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,880
lt's hard to admit, but l've never had any luck with girls.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,230
But ever since Suwatee and her friends moved in, my life's changed!

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,130
l got to *BEEP* Kaori AND Misao, one right after the other!

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,310
lt seems like there's an endless supply of girls to *BEEP* *BEEP*!

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,140
Suwatee is sweet, and Shuree is a nosy loudmouth.

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,870
But l'm turning into some kind of animal!

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,750
No! No, no, no, no!

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,180
That's not the way it should be.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,490
Love is a natural, beautiful thing!

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,280
Then a new girl stepped into my love life.

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,020
The girl who landed right in front of me is Chisato Sugita.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,860
Ah, l feel destiny again!

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,310
Can Can Bunny

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,210
Can Can Bunny
Extra 2

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,490
Welcome!

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,990
Chisato, are you feeling better?

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,630
Sorry. l haven't been sleeping much lately.

19
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,310
This comic is almost exactly like ''X-2''.

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,360
Did you write it, Chisato?

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,840
Do you watch X-2, Kenta? l'm a huge fan!

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,350
Space Detective X-2!

23
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,740
<i>An otaku girl?</i>

24
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,910
Be quiet, Shuree!

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,010
Ah, um... nothing!

26
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,780
Have you shown this to a publisher?

27
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,420
No, l'd be embarrassed to show it to someone l didn't know.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
lt just so happens that l'm working part time at Shudansha, the comic publisher.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,260
Chisato, l'll introduce you to the editor.

30
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,340
Amazing! l'm so lucky l met you, Kenta!

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,970
<i>How fortunate, Kenta.</i>

32
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,200
<i>A girl who thinks she can count on you!</i>

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,820
Good! Go, Mars!

34
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,310
Don't give up, Venus!

35
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,820
<i>Five more girls...</i>

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,290
<i>Kenta, l wish you would realize how l feel about you.</i>

37
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,650
What is this? What's going on?

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,010
This... this can't be!

39
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,180
Suwatee!

40
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,380
The Northern Emperor Shibi!

41
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,520
Suwatee, do you know why l am here?

42
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,500
Yes, it's because l stole the stars.

43
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,720
l'm really sorry.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,270
You must return the seven stars before the full moon,

45
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,970
or else become my one thousandth wife.

46
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,550
Furthermore, lf you use the star to touch a human man,

47
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,310
you will lose all memory of him.

48
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,650
But...

49
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,560
lt's been awhile since l enjoyed a virgin like you!

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,730
Yes! Then l'll pick up the manuscript tonight. Yes.

51
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,660
What do you think, Chief?

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,730
The art and plot are fine, but...

53
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,400
Well...

54
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,680
Chisato, you're a big Space Detective X-2 fan, aren't you?

55
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,010
Yes.

56
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,810
Lots of people are following that trend in comics.

57
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,710
lf you want to be a star, you need your own style.

58
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,220
l see.

59
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,050
The deadline for our New Manga Competition is soon, but...

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,990
...you could enter a finished copy of this one.

61
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,160
Chief!

62
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,760
But still, it's such a surprise to see Kenta bring a girl here all of a sudden!

63
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,870
But l...

64
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,440
You're such a nice guy.

65
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,900
<i>But, it is one of your best qualities.</i>

66
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,480
l'm not going to enter the contest.

67
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,390
With exams next year, if l stop going to class, my mom will kill me.

68
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,630
But if l cut back on how much l sleep, it'll be like it was earlier today.

69
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,900
But, since having Aya see it, l'm feeling better.

70
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,370
Thank you for your help, Kenta.

71
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,270
Chisato, wait a minute!

72
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,010
Kenta?

73
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,830
You're awfully quiet. What's wrong?

74
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,930
Come on, tell your cousin.

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,570
Wait a minute, okay? lt's a mess.

76
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,430
Okay, come on in, Chisato.

77
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,440
Okay.

78
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,640
lt's not a great room, but...

79
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,580
<i>What, is this girl with you?</i>

80
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,370
Be quiet!

81
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,500
Did you say something?

82
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,050
Oh, it was nothing!

83
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,210
Anyways, please use this
room as often as you want.

84
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:38,920
But...

85
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,440
Hey, Kenta, are you back?

86
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,290
Well, well, a girl, you old wolf.

87
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,460
So? How many times have you done it?

88
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,290
Saiki!

89
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,270
Get out of here!

90
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,460
Yeah, yeah, sure.

91
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,990
But first look at this!

92
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,500
Ta da!

93
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,040
What's this?

94
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,010
l'm the lead actor. Come and see me!

95
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,940
Are you stupid? Only kids are interested in that kind of thing.

96
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,700
X-2! Wonderful!

97
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,910
Okay then, this poster is a present for Kenta's new girlfriend.

98
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,350
Wow! Really?!

99
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,460
Space Detective!

100
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,450
X-2!

101
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,190
So, you'll be there!

102
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,690
Now listen...

103
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,860
See you, Kenta! Have fun doing it!

104
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,160
Just hurry up and get out!

105
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,570
Our Earth is turning round in space.

106
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,530
The Earth is like a blue pearl in space.

107
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,940
A spaceman said this beautiful Earth is for you and for me.

108
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,280
ln this way...

109
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,080
That's a pretty lame disguise!

110
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,150
Kenta...

111
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,420
This imagery allows us to see the Earth as...

112
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,600
Jeez, she's been hard at work for three hours!

113
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,730
l'm sorry, Ma'am.

114
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,000
lt was all my idea.

115
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,370
l just wanted to give Chisato time to write her comic.

116
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,140
So, please don't tell her mother.

117
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,940
Don't worry. lt's no problem.

118
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,140
lt's so sweet of you to want to help.

119
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,750
But l feel a little jealous of Chisato.

120
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,820
When l see a happy couple, l can't help wanting to tempt the man a little.

121
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,690
Are you okay?

122
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,130
T-That's pretty tempting!

123
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,340
Oh, good grief!

124
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,460
l can't believe how much he gets laid!

125
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,240
Hey, what's with you?

126
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,210
You're acting so weird. What's up?

127
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,540
Nothing, really.

128
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,520
That's so good, Kenta.

129
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,920
Right there... deeper!

130
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,500
So good! That's it!

131
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,200
Not yet...

132
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,000
l think l'm going to come!

133
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,580
Pull out!

134
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,380
Please! Squirt it on me!

135
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,120
So much! There's so much!

136
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,260
Chisato, what's up?

137
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,260
Kenta!

138
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,410
All the comics you wrote got thrown away?

139
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,350
Mom found them while l was at school.

140
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,020
l had most of the new one in my bag,

141
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,080
but the deadline is so close.

142
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,890
l don't have time to both study and re-draw the missing parts.

143
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,000
You helped me so much, Kenta.

144
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,600
l'm really sorry. l feel-

145
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,500
Heads up!

146
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,310
Sorry!

147
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,310
Kenta!

148
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,370
Chisato, l'll help you!

149
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,680
You've worked so hard. lf we work together, we can do it!

150
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,410
Kenta!

151
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,330
Chisato, l've finished drawing that part.

152
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,930
Then fill in the colors.

153
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,270
Okay, sure.

154
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,400
What's with her?

155
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,170
She's determined to finish the comic.

156
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,570
He's going to exhaust himself.

157
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,440
He won't quit.

158
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,150
Good morning, Kenta!

159
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,190
l'm the first one here.

160
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,920
Were you here all night?

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,900
Yes, well...

162
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,190
You sure have stamina.

163
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,560
These days it's hard to find a man like that.

164
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,970
Aya!

165
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,130
So energetic!

166
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,460
That's so good, Aya!

167

l can't hold on!

170
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,340
<i>Kenta!</i>

171

Shuree, how's Kenta doing?

172
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,190
Come on. There's nothing you can do.

173
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,660
Shuree, l... l...

174
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,760
Let Chisato take care of him for now.

175
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,630
l'm sorry, Kenta. lt's my fault you're sick.

176
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,800
He'll be fine in no time. He's just tired.

177
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,030
Nurse...

178
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,940
He just needs to rest.

179
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,280
Kenta...

180
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,440
Seiryuka Hospital

181

<i>Kenta, l promise you l won't give up!</i>

This is the comic for the contest!

185
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,150
That's fantastic, Chisato!

186
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,120
Hey, did you stay here with me all night?

187
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,360
Working on the manga, of course.

188
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,620
Thank you.

189
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,590
That's the best medicine l could get.

190
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,800
Suwatee, forget about Kenta,

191
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,600
and let's go home. Okay?

192
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,710
What about the promise Suwatee made to the Northern Emperor Shibi?

193
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,940
Alright you guys, what did you mean by that?

194
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,890
They told me everything.

195
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,370
Hurry up and tell Kenta it's over and return the stars!

196
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,480
Suwatee.

197
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,540
With the star l can make love to Kenta...

198
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,080
...but, l wouldn't remember any of it!

199
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,430
l thought if Kenta would treat me like a woman,

200
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,590
l would be able to leave everything.

201
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,330
But, l don't want to forget about Kenta!

202
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,260
l love him, but we can't be together!

203
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,670
l don't want to become Emperor Shibi's wife!

204
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,910
No! No! l just want to die!

205
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,640
Suwatee, calm down!

206
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,170
No, let go of me! l want to die!

207
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,620
Suwatee!

208
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,910
No!

209
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,550
Stop!

210
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,640
Suwatee, l wish Kenta would realize how much you love him.

211
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,580

X-2! X-2! Where are you?!

219
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,140
Saiki, you idiot! You hurt your back?

220
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,470
Probably did it screwing some girl!

221
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,440
Who are you guys?

222
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,340
We're Saiki's friends.

223
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,320
Saiki's friends?

224

You're Chisato, aren't you?

228
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,390
You're a big X-2 fan, right?

229
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,560
Saiki, you bastard. You set us up.

230
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,400
Here's hoping Kenta doesn't screw up.

231
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,190
Are you feeling okay, Chisato?

232
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,300
You haven't slept much lately.

233

Kenta, you're paying for your fun.

319
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,610

That's not the point.

Who's that beautiful woman?

You're supposed to be invisible.

332
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,470
People with strong spiritual sense can see me.

333
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,130
What happened to Chisato?

334
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,870
Uh, she's no one special!

335
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,160
Oh, now l remember. You were my nurse.

336
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,910
l'm really just a student.

337
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,470
My name is Haruna. Haruna Sakamoto.

338
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,310
This is a beautiful garden.

339
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,850
Yes, my grandfather said there used to be a church here before the war.

340
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,860
A friend of his looks after the garden now that he's passed away.

341
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,260
Don't you have any...

342
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,200
Relatives? No.

343
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,760
Hey, Haruna!

344
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,530
Yes, Uncle Okamura?

345
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,470
How's it going? Did you find your lost necklace?

346
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,770
No, l'm still looking.

347
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,600
Okay, good luck.

348
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,570
l have to go have another test now.

349
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,180
Excuse me, l need to keep looking for my necklace.

350
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,540
Okay, see you.

351
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,520
You know, Shuree...

352
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,720
What?

353
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,280
Now that l think of it, you really are quite beautiful.

354
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,050
Stupid! What are you saying all of the sudden?

355
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,190
Like you don't say that to every girl you meet!

356
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,160
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

357
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,750
l thought l'd dropped it here.

358
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,020
Help me...

359
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,580
Help me...

360
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,620
Help me...

361
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,500
Help me...

362
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,190
Help me!
