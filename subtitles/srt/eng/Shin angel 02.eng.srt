1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,343
Shizuka!

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,845
Kousuke, you can do whatever you want to me.

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,307
Please, be gentle.

4
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,036
Oh, it feels so good!

5
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,922
More! More! Lick me more!

6
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,808
Oh, it's so good, Kousuke.

7
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,149
Do you like it, Shizuka?

8
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,777
Yes, it feels so good.

9
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,116
Oh, fuck me!

10
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,159
Hurry, Kousuke!

11
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,080
There, Shizuka...

12
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:23,250
Kousuke! Kousuke! Kousuke!

13
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,047
Shizuka!

14
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,507
Let's fuck!

15
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,808
New Angel 2
.

16
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,853
New Angel 2
Flying Angel

17
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,371
Man, I was so close to having sex with Shizuka.

18
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,342
Atami!

19
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,471
Yamada, don't scare me like that!

20
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,474
I got a premium video.

21
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,017
A premium video?

22
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,603
Hold back! Can't you see this?

23
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,104
Yes, Sir.

24
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:30,150
There! "Make Me Come,
You Pervert - Special Edition!"

25
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,657
What the fuck is this?!

26
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,621
Sorry! Wrong tape.

27
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,792
I went sky diving in my father's helicopter recently.

28
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,295
Sky diving? You?

29
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,880
Now that's something hard to imagine!

30
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,759
Okay, so let's see this
"pervert" tape already!

31
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,353
What's wrong, Atami?

32
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,231
There was a girl here just a minute ago!

33
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,191
She's going to jump and commit suicide!

34
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,527
What's she doing over there?

35
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,654
Stop! Don't be stupid!

36
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,155
Don't come any closer!

37
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,575
Are you going to kill yourself?

38
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,034
I want to die alone.

39
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,289
But why? What horrible events have driven you to this?

40
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,541
College entrance exams?
Family problems?

41
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,502
Did your boyfriend tell you that
your vagina has a bad odor?

42
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,716
It's none of your business!
I hate my life!

43
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,184
Keep away from me!

44
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,936
Hey, Yamada!

45
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,948
Are you really sure you're going to kill yourself?

46
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,117
Yes...

47
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,119
What a waste.

48
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,539
What a waste, you slamming into that hard ground

49
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,374
and dying with your brains splattered all over.

50
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,044
Hey, if you're going to die,

51
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,795
you probably won't have to
worry about birth control, right?

52
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,298
How about this?

53
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,091
Since I don't have any
luck with women,

54
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,551
would you let me have sex with you before you die?

55
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,012
Please, let me into your tunnel of love!

56
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,851
Well, I'm going to die anyway.

57
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,522
All right...

58
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,565
What? Really?

59
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,070
Playing with myself and watching girls' panties...

60
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,112
Underpants!

61
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,533
Playing with myself and watching girls' panties...

62
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,378
Playing with myself and watching... Why?

63
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,339
You know, you could be right.

64
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:03,470
It might be a good idea to help
someone less fortunate before I die.

65
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,849
I'll just lie down here like a doll.

66
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,308
You can do whatever you want to me.

67
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,663
What?

68
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,500
You may die soon, but you're
feeling good right now, aren't you?

69
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,276
Hey, even though sex makes you
feel like you want to live forever

70
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,736
why are you in such a big hurry to die?

71
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:46,949
I see.

72
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,450
I guess you're not going to say anything.

73
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,285
Then, I'll have to use my secret weapon to make you talk!

74
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,879
Oh, that feels so good!

75
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,976
Very good! Really good!

76
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,927
Wonderful!

77
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,655
Okay, the reason Miki Ochiai wants to kill herself is this:

78
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,410
There's this boy she's been in love with
ever since she started school here.

79
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,746
His name is Kunihiko Kawamura.

80
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,666
Although it embarrassed her terribly,

81
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,462
she finally got up the nerve to
slip a love letter into his locker

82
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:29,551
but the very next day, she found her letter in the trash.

83
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,847
What?! Are you saying there was
a letter in my locker yesterday?

84
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,767
How could you tear up that letter and throw it away?

85
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,729
Couldn't you imagine how she'd feel?

86
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,105
That's right!

87
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,690
I don't know of anything about that sort of letter.

88
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,484
You bastard! You're lying!

89
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:50,906
Have you gone nuts? I've never
received a love letter in my life!

90
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,366
Can't you understand that, you moron?

91
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,578
Kousuke, there's something's fishy here.

92
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,955
I think there's more going on here than meets the eye.

93
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,456
Hey, look out!

94
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:03,502
I took my eyes off Miki for just a second and she vanished!

95
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,712
I told you to watch her!

96
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,465
Sorry, I was concentrating on my tape.

97
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,843
This new tape I got is really stimulating.

98
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,052
New tape?

99
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:16,139
Hey! Looking for Miki is the most important thing.

100
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,100
That's right. Let's go!

101
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,521
Someone who's tried to commit
suicide once might try it again.

102
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:27,025
He hasn't read your letter, so he doesn't how you feel yet.

103
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,569
Don't die, Miki.

104
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,863
I have no choice except to kill myself.

105
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,823
Good bye, me!

106
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,201
Good bye, my enjoyable educational experience!

107
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,454
There she is!

108
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,874
Miki, stop! This is stupid!

109
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,920
Miki, listen! I just talked to Kawamura

110
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,214
and he said there was nothing in his locker.

111
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,924
Impossible!

112
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,885
Somebody must have taken your letter

113
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,429
and shredded it before
Kawamura ever saw it.

114
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,098
Kawamura doesn't know that you're in love with him.

115
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,683
Give it another try!

116
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,811
You're just telling me this to stop me, aren't you?

117
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,605
It's no lie!

118
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:09,401
Stop trying to trick me into
feeling better! I really love him!

119
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,113
She's not going to listen.

120
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,406
I'll stay here and keep an eye on her.

121
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,783
You better hurry and find
Kawamura, Kousuke.

122
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,918
Why's he in such a rush?

123
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,214
Who tore up that love letter? Damn!

124
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,675
How many times do I have to say this?
I'm not lying.

125
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,594
There was no letter in my locker!

126
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,932
Even if I did see a letter, I'm not
some monster who'd just rip it up!

127
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,143
I don't care! There's a girl out there trying to kill herself.

128
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:48,106
Come on! Please! You're the only person who can save Miki.

129
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,234
Miki?!

130
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,445
It's a girl named Miki Ochiai who's trying to kill herself.

131
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,241
Miki Ochiai?!

132
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,409
Hey!

133
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,620
What's the matter?

134
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:07,960
How could this have happened?!
She hasn't read my letter!

135
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:13,841
What's that, Kawamura?
You mean you love Miki too?

136
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,471
Don't come any closer!

137
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,516
I'm also in love with someone who doesn't know it yet.

138
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,018
I'll tell him someday too

139
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,772
but even if it breaks my heart,
I won't regret it,

140
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:32,150
and I can't imagine trying to kill myself.

141
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:37,322
Just being in love is wonderful enough, isn't it?

142
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,785
And besides, you really haven't told him you love him, so...

143
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:45,664
Shut up! I know Kawamura hates me!

144
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,044
Idiot!

145
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:56,383
I can't believe Ochiai loves me too.
Ah, twisted destiny!

146
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,885
Kawamura...

147
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,928
Hurry up, let's find her!

148
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,346
All right! This way!

149
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,602
What the hell did you do to me?

150
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:11,565
Kawamura is mine!
I won't let Miki Ochiai have him!

151
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,862
Oh, no, what the hell?

152
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,073
Shizuka!

153
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,753
Kousuke! Kousuke!

154
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,550
Kousuke, wake up!

155
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,181
Shizuka...

156
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,058
What happened?

157
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,728
Oh, where's Miki?

158
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:56,944
I'm so relieved.

159
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,906
Idiot!

160
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,705
That was too close.

161
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:12,709
Damn! I've got to catch that girl.

162
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,837
Which girl is that?

163
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:19,633
I don't know all the details yet, but
there's another girl who loves Kawamura.

164
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,722
Watch Ochiai, Shizuka! And tie
her up tight so she can't escape!

165
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,777
Damn! Where'd that girl go?

166
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,154
Meow! Come here, little boy.

167
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,614
Bitch!

168
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,825
Hey, wait!

169
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,038
I'm a bit of a pervert myself.

170
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,626
Would you mind sticking your thing inside me?

171
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,985
Ah! Hurry up and fuck me!

172
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,196
Why are you doing this?

173
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,907
Where'd you hide Kawamura?

174
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:30,913
I'll tell you, but you have to put
your thing into my deep, wet spot.

175
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,502
Please...

176
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,886
What the hell?

177
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,305
Still, it feels so good.

178
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,021
Why did you tear up Miki's love letters to Kawamura?

179
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,900
I won't tell unless you fuck me.

180
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,027
I see. All right, if you say so.

181
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,947
I guess I'll have to make you tell me the whole story.

182
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,367
How about this?

183
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,259
Oh, oh, delicious!

184
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:38,146
I didn't want to do this.

185
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:42,484
I'm sorry, but you might try to kill yourself again.

186
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:46,363
Just be patient until Kousuke brings Kawamura.

187
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,493
Yamada! Don't you think that tying
her up like that is a little perverted?

188
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,204
Is this too crazy?

189
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,123
Yamada, watch her carefully.

190
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,624
Sure!

191
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,129
I wonder if it was a good idea to ask Yamada to watch her?

192
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,465
It's like leaving a wolf to protect the sheep.

193
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,594
Anyway, the most important thing is to find Kawamura.

194
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:19,897
What a perverted scene! A woman,
wearing just a slip, all tied up.

195
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,462
Ah, it's coming deep inside of me!

196
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,716
Ah, it feels so good.

197
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:52,513
Okay, how about it?
I've screwed you like you wanted.

198
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,809
Ah, I feel like my pussy's going to burst.

199
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,269
Oh, Kawamura!

200
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:00,687
You bitch!

201
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:04,149
Where'd you hide Kawamura? Tell me!

202
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,571
Oh, good. More. More!

203
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,573
If you don't tell me...

204
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,036
Please, don't stop! I'll tell you!

205
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,711
Where's Kawamura?

206
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,676
He's in the gym warehouse.

207
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,473
Oh, I'm coming!

208
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,686
Gym warehouse? I see.

209
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,698
Damn!

210
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,909
Wait for me!
I'll get Kawamura to you.

211
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,084
Shizuka!

212
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,295
Kousuke, I was looking for you.

213
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,842
What? What are you doing like that?

214
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:14,219
Well, standing fu...

215
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,638
I mean, I was taking a piss back there.

216
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,766
Is there anything back there?

217
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:20,559
No! No!

218
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,019
You sound like you were doing something wrong.

219
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:27,065
Ah, I don't have time to do this.
Did you find Kawamura?

220
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:30,611
Yes, I think he's in the gym warehouse.
How about Miki?

221
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:34,489
Yamada's watching her right now, not that I trust him.

222
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,408
Why don't you go and see how they are doing, Kousuke?

223
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,035
I'll go to the warehouse.

224
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:39,912
Okay!

225
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:53,842
Kawamura?

226
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,512
Kawamura?

227
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:03,936
Where are you, Kawamura?

228
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:06,688
Hey!

229
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,107
He's not here.

230
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,235
Who are you?

231
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,655
That's not important.
I know where he is.

232
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,283
Come with me. This way.

233
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,339
Oh, what a perverted scene this is!

234
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,466
Oh, it feels so good! I'm coming!

235
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:38,929
What a mess. I see it all now.
It's just like Shizuka said.

236
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,515
Hi, Atami.

237
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:44,810
Let me go!
Why are you putting me here?

238
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:50,440
Because you didn't listen to a word
I said. Kawamura loves you.

239
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,317
I can't believe that.

240
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,405
Kawamura will get here soon, just be patient.

241
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,700
Liar!
Everything you say is a lie, you liar!

242
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:04,454
Let me die right now. Let me die!

243
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,665
You want to die that badly...

244
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,717
She's fainted.

245
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,802
I guess I over did it a little.

246
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,069
What the hell is this?

247
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,990
The boy in that picture's your boyfriend, isn't he?

248
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,035
He raped me, you know.

249
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:54,296
What are you talking about? I know
you engineered the whole thing.

250
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,217
I'll tell the school board that he raped me.

251
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,427
Then the school will kick him out.

252
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,638
If you want to keep him from being expelled,

253
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:06,558
tell Miki Ochiai to give up on Kawamura.

254
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,976
I know what you're up to!

255
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:14,691
If you even try it, you bitch,
I'll make sure you regret it!

256
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:20,531
Miki's out of her mind from the
shock having her heart broken.

257
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:26,537
The least you could do is have
compassion for a fellow student!

258
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:31,166
And don't think I'll go easy on you
because you're a girl, you bitch!

259
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,210
Where'd you hide Kawamura?

260
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,172
Hey, time's running out!

261
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,475
Where am I?

262
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,146
I remember. He tied me up, and...

263
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:59,778
The rope's untied now.
Now I can finally die.

264
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:08,662
Help me!

265
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:22,134
Oh, no! What's going on?

266
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:28,140
I asked Yamada's father to make
the same thing as the school locker.

267
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,936
I see.

268
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:38,358
I really appreciate it. I can kill
myself by falling from here now.

269
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,867
Do you think I'm still lying even though
I am doing such a thing?

270
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:52,581
For the last time, try telling
Kawamura about your feelings again!

271
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,627
If you really love him, your life is worth the gamble!

272
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:02,174
Kawamura's waiting for you on the ground.

273
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:07,221
Can't you feel his eyes?
Can't you hear him calling?

274
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:22,569
This is weird. Kousuke told me to take Kawamura to the

275
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:26,448
schoolyard and to watch the skies but I don't see anything.

276
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:28,742
Miki!

277
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:37,084
Miki! I love you! I didn't know you gave me a love letter!

278
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,919
Kawamura!

279
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,757
Kawamura!

280
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,218
Miki!

281
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,387
I hear him! I hear him!

282
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,765
I can hear Kawamura!

283
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:58,063
Miki, I love you. Please don't die!

284
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:10,033
I don't want to die.
What shall I do?

285
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,703
Shout out how you feel now.

286
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:14,663
How I feel...

287
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,756
Playing with myself and watching girl's panties...

288
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:27,885
Playing with myself and watching girl's panties...

289
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,595
Playing with myself and watching girl's panties...

290
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:33,140
I love Kawamura!

291
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:39,313
I don't want to die before
I tell him I love him.

292
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:43,442
I really love Kawamura!

293
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,977
Miki...

294
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,438
Kawamura...

295
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,024
Man, was I scared.

296
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,734
Kousuke...

297
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,694
How's about you give me a booby prize?

298
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:29,947
Kousuke!

299
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,742
Still, I am glad you're safe.

300
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:36,995
Shizuka, I can't breathe.

301
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,047
I got off just by looking at a woman's underpants.

302
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,468
Thanks, Dad!

303
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,371
Seifuku o nuide

304
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:23,542
Kami no ribbon hodoke ba

305

00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,134
Betsu na onna no ko

00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:36,513

Hanarete ite mo, ima

00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:07,002
Sugu, pinchi wakaru no

00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:11,757
