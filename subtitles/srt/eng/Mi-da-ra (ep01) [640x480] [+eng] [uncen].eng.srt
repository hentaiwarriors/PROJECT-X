1
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:15,892
Until that day...

2
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:19,090
Until that day,
everything was fine.

3
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,300
Maybe I was just resisting
an urge that existed inside me...

4
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,945
But now...

5
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,797
Yumi!

6
00:00:57,673 --> 00:01:01,973
The Yumi I saw in the video
was under the control of a man.

7
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:06,611
The things that he was
doing to her were cruel.

8
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:14,523
- No, please!
- But I was powerless to stop it.

9
00:01:14,523 --> 00:01:15,691
NO!!!

10
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:19,928
- Because I really did want
to have sex with her.
- No!

11
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:25,127
I couldn't deny the feelings
I was hiding inside of me.

12
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:29,433
And as if to provide
the proof of this...

13
00:01:30,706 --> 00:01:35,166
...the man in the video was
none other than myself.

14
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:42,040
I wonder which one is the real me.

15
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:45,586
You smell nice.

16
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,957
Okay, now let me see.
Let me see... everything.

17
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:53,159
Stop it!

18
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:54,661
Stop it, please!

19
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:57,056
- Master...!
- Big Brother...

20
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,669
Didn't I tell you not to resist?

21
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:03,900
Until that day,
everything was fine.

22
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:06,201
But, Master...!

23
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:10,807
Look at that!

24
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,282
- But my heart has been swept by...
- Such a pretty little sheen it has.

25
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:16,308
...these feelings for a long time now.
- You were worth all the money
I paid for you!

26
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,418
If I had just suppressed
these feelings...

27
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,754
...which hurt so much
to keep inside me...

28
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:27,523
...perhaps our peaceful days
would have continued.

29
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:32,256
I'm changing, little by little.

30
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:37,705
Little by little,
ever since that day.

31
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,664
In my heart...

32
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:41,738
In my body...

33
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:53,881
So inexperienced...
Just the way I like them!

34
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:56,220
Master, please stop!

35
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,055
If you don't, I'll...!

36
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:05,165
I'll lose my mind...!

37
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:09,931
We're just getting started.
You're going to be my special pet.

38
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:19,513
Yes...

39
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:21,815
...Big Brother...

40
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:37,462
What Does Big Brother Want?

41
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:40,462
This is Yukio Hashiba.

42
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:43,505
And that's his daughter Yumi.

43
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:46,200
Yukio, this is my son.

44
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,167
Yuuto Sanada.
How do you do, sir?

45
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:53,680
Yukio Hashiba.
It's a pleasure.

46
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:56,684
Go on, Yumi. Say hello.

47
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:05,090
I'm... Yumi Hashiba.

48
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:17,965
The beach is nice
in the spring, isn't it?

49
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,940
Yes, it is.

50
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,676
Yumi?

51
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,104
Y-yes?

52
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:29,583
I know you must still love
your late mother a lot...

53
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:36,917
I think remembering her is
really important for you to do.

54
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,152
But even as you treasure
your feelings for her...

55
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,325
...it's all right to accept
having a new family, isn't it?

56
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,199
No matter what,
I want you to think of me as family.

57
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:57,604
I'm also an only child...

58
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:00,147
I always wanted a big brother.

59
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:04,408
Could I maybe...
call you "Big Brother"?

60
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,584
And... I can just call you Yumi?

61
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:10,382
Big Brother...

62
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:12,416
Yumi.

63
00:05:12,494 --> 00:05:14,223
Big Brother...

64
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:15,524
Yumi...

65
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:18,223
Big Brother.

66
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:22,502
Big Brother, it's morning!
Time to get up!

67
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:27,741
Breakfast is ready!

68
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:34,008
Morning.

69
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:35,208
Morning!

70
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,013
Mom's away again?

71
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:38,712
Yeah. Business trip.

72
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:41,187
She phoned and said
she'd be home tomorrow.

73
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:53,734
Sorry you have to do all this
for me every day.

74
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:56,930
No prob.
I like doing stuff like this.

75
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:02,936
In the end, we became a family.
Five years have passed.

76
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:08,512
Looking back, I've loved Yumi
since the moment I first saw her.

77
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:15,988
And my feelings for her have matured
over these last 5 years.

78
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:19,417
But I never let Yumi know
how I feel about her.

79
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:22,930
And I've been tormented by
these feelings day after day.

80
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:27,025
I'm visiting her grave today.

81
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,599
Huh? Grave? Whose?

82
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:33,834
Who do you think?

83
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:38,505
Oh. Right. Your real mom's.
Sorry, I forgot.

84
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,947
It's okay.

85
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:42,415
So, is Yuki...

86
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:46,880
I mean, is Dad going with you?

87
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:48,752
He has a meeting at the office.

88
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:50,724
He said to meet him there.

89
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,721
He'll be going back to the office
and spending the night in a hotel.

90
00:06:56,264 --> 00:06:57,424
I see.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,629
5 years ago, I was full of hope.

92
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,337
I thought everything was
going to work out perfectly.

93
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:09,935
But, as the years
rolled by so quickly...

94
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:13,503
...life for us changed radically.

95
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:17,352
And our parents' relationship...

96
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:20,055
...isn't what it once was.

97
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,545
I'm off!

98
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:23,648
Sure. Take care.

99
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:30,959
Well, I should get going, too.

100
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:35,827
Shall we go?

101
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:37,565
Right...

102
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,164
I can't forgive my mother.

103
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:41,676
Want to get something to eat?

104
00:07:41,676 --> 00:07:46,079
Oh, no.
I have to make dinner.

105
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,248
Yuuto!

106
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:53,818
Oh, sorry.
What were you saying?

107
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:55,722
Penny for your thoughts.

108
00:07:55,791 --> 00:08:00,319
You look like
something's bugging you.

109
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:05,355
Both my parents will
be away tonight, so...

110
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,260
...you're afraid Yumi
will be all alone?

111
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:10,804
You really worry about
your sister, don't you?

112
00:08:10,872 --> 00:08:15,002
Oh, well. Let's just call it
an early night tonight.

113
00:08:15,844 --> 00:08:17,675
I'm really sorry.

114
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:25,751
Forgive me, Kaori...

115
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:30,019
But the truth is...
My real feelings are...!

116
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:33,890
Well, I'd better get back to work.

117
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:36,157
Sure. Oh, Dad?

118
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:37,493
Hm?

119
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:41,332
Once in a while...
Can we all eat together?

120
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,795
Together, as a family?

121
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:48,665
Yes, of course.
Well, see you.

122
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:02,755
How long...
How long can this family last?

123
00:09:03,758 --> 00:09:08,388
How much longer
will I be Yuuto's sister?

124
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,928
Our parents' divorce is
a question of "when," not "if."

125
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:19,770
That's why I want to spend
every second I can with Yumi...

126
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:22,366
...before the end finally comes.

127
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:27,004
Whoops!

128
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,447
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.
Hm...?

129
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,756
This isn't mine.

130
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:36,724
It's yours now.

131
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:47,094
I'm home.

132
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:51,533
Yumi isn't home yet?

133
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,275
There was no label on it.

134
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:58,402
A strange feeling filled my body...

135
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:24,369
Isn't there anything
recorded on it?

136
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:28,671
And now for the last girl
of the day, gentlemen.

137
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:30,973
Have a look at this one!

138
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,144
The item for sale
is a virgin of rare beauty!

139
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:41,314
Okay, 4000! 4500! 4700!

140
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:44,792
This girl is our
finest offering today...

141
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:46,588
...and she's worth a high price!

142
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:47,992
No other bids?

143
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:52,227
Right! 4800! 4850!

144
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:56,298
Y-Yumi?

145
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:01,376
- Wh-where is this?
What's going on?!

146
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:02,177
- 6000!
- Wh-where is this?
What's going on?!

147
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:03,075
- 7000!
- Wh-where is this?
What's going on?!

148
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:05,914
- 7000! Do I hear higher?
- Yumi... Yumi isn't a thing to be sold!

149
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:07,541
- 7500!
- Yumi... Yumi isn't a thing to be sold!

150
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:11,019
No other bids?
All right, 7500...

151
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:11,786
Ten thousand!

152
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:12,343
What?!

153
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,589
Ten thousand! Ten thousand?!

154
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:17,353
All right, ten thousand!
I have ten thousand!

155
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:22,021
Ten thousand, ten thousand,
any higher bids? Ten thousand!

156
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:30,128
Impossible... Impossible!
That voice... That man is... He's...!

157
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:35,341
No other bids.
Sold for ten thousand!

158
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:39,814
Ten thousand... My God...

159
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:42,044
It's me! No, it can't be!

160
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:45,245
I wouldn't buy Yumi
like a THING!

161
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,748
Hm... What's your name?

162
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:49,658
- It's Yumi, sir.

163
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,192
- It's Yumi, sir.
- Don't touch her!
Don't touch my little sister...!

164
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:53,626
- I see. A pretty name.
- Don't touch her!
Don't touch my little sister...!

165
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:56,865
Thank you, Master.

166
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:57,854
Y-Yumi...!

167
00:11:57,932 --> 00:12:00,127
I think I like you.

168
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:10,970
Welcome home, Master!

169
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:17,382
Hello, Nobuhiro.
I acquired a fine thing today.

170
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:23,686
Oh, she's lovely.
An excellent deal, Master.

171
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:26,219
The preparations are set?

172
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:29,695
Yes, sir. Enjoy yourself
to your heart's content.

173
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:38,670
Now, then...

174
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,469
Y-yes...?

175
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:41,440
Strip.

176
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:43,170
Wh-what's he...?!

177
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:45,875
Didn't you hear me?

178
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:47,005
I... I did.

179
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,744
- Then be quick about it.
- Yumi, don't! Stop it...

180
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:52,883
Y-yes, sir.

181
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:56,984
This... This isn't what I want!

182
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:09,162
- Y-Yumi...
- Are you pleased, sir?

183
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:14,403
What are you saying?
You still have some clothes on.

184
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:17,033
Surely...
just this is all right?

185
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:21,805
- Oh, dear... The girl seems to be a bit slow.
- Stop it! Stay away from her!

186
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:26,448
I own you, understand?

187
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:28,222
Y-yes, sir.

188
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:30,916
Do you remember
what I paid for you?

189
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:32,892
Y-yes, sir.

190
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:35,730
You have two choices:

191
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,927
Either pay the full price
to me right now...

192
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,130
...or else devote yourself to me,
body and mind.

193
00:13:43,338 --> 00:13:45,636
Which will it be?

194
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:49,375
I can't... pay you the money.

195
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:53,945
Then you only have
one choice, understand?

196
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:56,043
Yes, sir.

197
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,854
- So beautiful...
- So beautiful...

198
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:10,031
I suddenly realized that,
bit by bit,

199
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:15,526
I was beginning to feel
like the man in the video.

200
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:19,733
What he saw, I was seeing.

201
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:23,503
What he thought, I was thinking.

202
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:27,882
If I didn't control myself...
if I didn't stop this...

203
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:30,578
...I was going to
turn into him completely.

204
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:40,317
I felt her.
So soft, so smooth...

205
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:43,262
The sensation of what he touched
was transmitted to me.

206
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,356
I was beginning to lose myself...

207
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:51,228
Oh, you feel so wonderful.

208
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:53,536
You almost seem to cling
to the palm of my hand.

209
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:55,940
I really can pick them, can't I?

210
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:04,819
But there are more essential parts
to test, aren't there?

211
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:07,014
Wh-what's he saying...?!

212
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,188
Stop it!

213
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:16,562
No...! Stop it!

214
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,068
Stop it...

215
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,729
NO!!!

216
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,801
STOP IT!!!

217
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,484
Big Brother!

218
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:51,399
Sorry I'm late.
I'll get dinner started right now.

219
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,799
S-sure!
Welcome home, Yumi!

220
00:15:57,005 --> 00:16:00,304
Wh-what on Earth...?

221
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:04,338
Sorry for the wait.
Dig in!

222
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:07,343
Let's eat!

223
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:12,820
Hey, this stuff's great!

224
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,490
Really? Well, eat all you want.

225
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,617
Great! More, please!

226
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:21,657
Our peaceful life together.

227
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:27,224
But if the feelings I held for Yumi
were ever released...

228
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:30,835
...this happiness
would crumble away.

229
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:34,108
And now there's
this video tape which...

230
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:37,134
...seems to reveal what I keep
buried deep in my heart.

231
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:47,144
It was going to destroy
the peaceful life I shared with Yumi.

232
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:50,022
What was it, exactly?

233
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:53,083
Why did it have to exist?

234
00:17:01,402 --> 00:17:02,266
It's morning...

235
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:08,740
God, your expression
is so forced!

236
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:11,978
Oh, morning, Big Brother.

237
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:15,272
Morning.
Nice to see you, Ruri.

238
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,284
Pardon the visit.

239
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:19,053
Morning, Big Brother.

240
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:22,420
Morning.
What's with the uniforms?

241
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,323
It's kinda dorky to wear them
after graduation.

242
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:27,224
Graduation pictures
for our scrapbooks!

243
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,423
Big Brother, can you get
a two-shot of Ruri and me?

244
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:37,070
Okay, here we go!
What does a mouse like to eat?

245
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:38,967
- CHEESE!
- CHEESE!

246
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:45,608
Okay, Yumi, you
take the next one.

247
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:46,871
Huh?

248
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:49,473
Get a two-shot of
me and Big Brother!

249
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:50,915
Ruri...?

250
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:57,916
I wish I was as
straightforward as Ruri.

251
00:17:57,992 --> 00:18:00,187
What's wrong? Take it!

252
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:02,229
Oh, s-sorry.

253
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,234
- Why do I feel so strange?
- Sorry, I've gotta run.

254
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:09,431
Oh, darn it. Is it a date?

255
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:12,402
No, no, it's not that.

256
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:14,498
I'll just bet it isn't.

257
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:17,078
I'll hang out with you
next time, okay?

258
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:18,807
That's a promise, right?

259
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:26,220
C'mon, let's not do this.

260
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,422
Just relax.

261
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,617
He doesn't have anything
like that in here.

262
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:35,520
I'd be more worried
if he didn't have one!

263
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:37,928
Let's look for it while
we have the chance!

264
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:42,365
There, you see? Suspicious goods
found almost immediately.

265
00:18:43,237 --> 00:18:44,465
Looks like he watched it
all last night...

266
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:47,133
...and just sort of
tossed it to the side.

267
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:50,333
No label, either.
It's GOTTA be...

268
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:56,372
Ruri, let's just stop!

269
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,816
Huh? Why?

270
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:59,318
Because!

271
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:01,218
Let's watch it together.

272
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:04,452
Count me out!
You can watch it by yourself.

273
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:07,221
Jeez...

274
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:11,764
Ruri, I have to buy
some groceries for dinner.

275
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,631
Can you mind the house
for me while I'm gone?

276
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:17,364
Sure. Take your time.

277
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,824
What exactly was that video?

278
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:43,720
I returned to the park
where this all began.

279
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,338
I couldn't find
any clues there, until...

280
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:55,308
Looking for something?

281
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:03,213
You... The girl from yesterday.

282
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:05,985
Am I?

283
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:09,045
The video...
You dropped it, right?

284
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:11,023
I'd like to return it.

285
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,026
That isn't necessary.

286
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:16,188
I said it was yours now,
remember?

287
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:18,962
So, it WAS you!

288
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:24,300
Why did you give me that...
that... disgusting thing?!

289
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:26,705
Is it really?

290
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:30,111
It's a magic video tape.

291
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:34,514
It has the power to show its owner
what will make him happy.

292
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:39,348
Make me happy?!
That thing will just destroy people!

293
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,621
Yes, if it's misused,
it can become...

294
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,091
...a cursed video which
will invite disaster.

295
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:51,757
So don't let anyone else
view or touch it.

296
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,992
Otherwise...

297
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:57,636
Otherwise... what?

298
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:14,746
Yumi, no!
Don't touch that video!

299
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,392
Now then, Ruri...

300
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,451
...do you understand
what this service involves?

301
00:21:22,563 --> 00:21:24,690
Yes, Big Brother...

302
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:28,627
I've memorized the methods
and theories of service.

303
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:32,662
I lack practical experience,
so I'm just an amateur...

304
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,232
...but I wish to devote myself
to being the best I can be!

305
00:21:36,777 --> 00:21:40,304
Very well said.
Then let us begin.

306
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:43,179
Yes, sir. If you'll excuse me.

307
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:56,430
I see. You're a novice,
but you have been practicing.

308
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,954
I like that.

309
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:01,030
Thank you... sir...

310
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:08,743
Okay, you're tolerably good.

311
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:11,112
Don't be so monotonous!
Use your tongue!

312
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:12,346
Synchronize your licking!

313
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:14,143
Yes, sir!

314
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:22,453
Hmm... Not bad.

315
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:30,765
Concentrate!
Your tongue-work's getting sloppy!

316
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:32,164
Yes, sir!

317
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:37,838
Big Brother... Big Brother...
I've always...!

318
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:38,964
Nobuhiro?

319
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,268
Yes, sir?

320
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:43,242
Lick Ruri's cunt!

321
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:44,576
Huh?!

322
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:46,614
M-me, sir?

323
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:48,249
Be quick about it!

324
00:22:48,249 --> 00:22:49,409
As you command, sir.

325
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:50,575
No!

326
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:53,586
He can't do that!
It can only be Big Brother!

327
00:22:54,355 --> 00:22:56,118
Oh God!

328
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,460
It feels so good...!

329
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:09,099
Big Brother... Big Brother...!
I'm going to...!

330
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:15,436
Fool! Who told you
to stop?! Continue!

331
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:17,812
P-please, Master!

332
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:18,546
What?!

333
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:23,745
I want you! I want IT!
I want YOU inside of me!

334
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:28,852
Then pay attention!
Now continue!

335
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:32,623
Y-yes, Master.

336
00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:37,458
Nobuhiro, Ruri is proving
to be unsatisfactory.

337
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:40,167
Stick yours into her.

338
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,532
What?!

339
00:23:42,103 --> 00:23:43,161
But, sir...!

340
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:44,670
Just do it!

341
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:46,832
As you command.

342
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:50,435
No, please! Anything but that!

343
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:56,016
No! I want my first time
to be with the Master!

344
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:57,506
I told you not to stop!

345
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:01,489
I'm ready, Master.

346
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:02,289
Hurry up!

347
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:04,382
No! NO!!!

348
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:19,262
Well done!

349
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,535
She's close to coming!

350
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:49,894
Big Brother...! Big Brother...!

351
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,042
I'm coming! I'm coming!

352
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:57,408
Master, I can't hold it anymore...!

353
00:24:58,412 --> 00:25:01,575
I'm ready to come, too.

354
00:25:24,004 --> 00:25:26,802
Yumi! Yumi, are you home?!

355
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:30,670
Yumi!

356
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:32,312
Ruri...?

357
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:40,650
Oh, no!

358
00:25:43,624 --> 00:25:45,524
Ruri, what did you see?

359
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,028
Was it the same thing I saw?

360
00:25:50,998 --> 00:25:52,933
I'm home!

361
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:56,270
What's going on?
Why's the door wide open?

362
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,670
Ruri? Are you in here?

363
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,178
Ruri? That's strange...

364
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,690
Is that... Big Brother's...
porn video?

365
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,696
That's the videotape
of happiness.

366
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:26,927
But don't let
anyone else watch it.

367
00:26:27,434 --> 00:26:29,766
Otherwise...
