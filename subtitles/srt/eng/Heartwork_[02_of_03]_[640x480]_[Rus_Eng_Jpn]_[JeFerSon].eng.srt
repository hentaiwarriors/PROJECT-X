1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,500
l'm always thinking of you.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,240
l know nothing is going to happen.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,970
But l'm still thinking of you always.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,010
l know my thoughts will never reach
you.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,310
They shouldn't reach you.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,580
Always and forever.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,260
You don't realize it.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,960
Since our paths never cross each other.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,760
But still l expect something to happen.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,730
Expectation?

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,700
Hope?

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,340
lf my wish comes true,
should l be hopeful?

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,710
Are you aware of me?

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,540
l'll be waiting for you always.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,880
On this same path.

16
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,560
l'm still sleepy since you called
me out this early in the morning.

17
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,930
All right.

18
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,270
You better use protection.

19
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,410
Now...

20
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,670
What do you wanna do?

21
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,120
What are you doing?

22
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,090
Give me some money if
you want it that bad!

23
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,520
How shrewd you are.

24
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,870
This is a freebie.

25
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,600
You wanna kiss me?

26
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,330
You idiot! What are you thinking?

27
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,710
You make me sick.

28
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,090
l haven't seen you for a long time

29
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,330
Hey Kumi. Good morning.

30
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,500
What do you mean hey? Hozumi!

31
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,500
Don't worry.

32
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,870
lt's not like l'm gonna
lose anything, right?

33
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,700
By the way...

34
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,040
What's going on with you and Asakura?

35
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,580
Did you do it with him?

36
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,450
Oh boy. Nothing happened
between you two.

37
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,750
He's my type, so can l tease him a bit?

38
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,100
Go ahead if you want to...

39
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,570
l want Asakura, but
l want you too, Kumi.

40
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,570
Enough!

41
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,710
You don't like me?

42
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,010
No, l...

43
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,550
Alrighty, l guess l'll
attend class for once.

44
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,590
Wait for me.

45
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,120
Hey, you shouldn't bring manga to
class.

46
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,560
How many times do l have to tell you?

47
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,600
Sorry we're late.

48
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,660
Ah, Sakatsu.

49
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,360
Are you feeling better now?

50
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,370
Yes.

51
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,170
Really? Then have a seat.

52
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,790
Asakura.

53
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,190
Well umm... This isn't mine.

54
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,370
Hey, hey, it's not mine.

55
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,840
Matsui...

56
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,710
Come to the teacher's
office during lunch break!

57
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,290
l did a very bad thing.

58
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,360
lt's not good to lie, you know.

59
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,920
Sakatsu...

60
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,210
l came here to see
what's going on, but it's boring.

61
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,380
Really?

62
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,570
Hey, is that a real gun?

63
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,900
What?

64
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,810
No, l was just wondering.

65
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,350
Ah, l knew you would be here.

66
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,340
Oh, it's you, senior!

67
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,980
Somebody told me
you were here this morning.

68
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,950
So l was looking for you.

69
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,590
What the hell, senior!

70
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,060
Now l have to tell Asakura to
keep his mouth shut from now on!

71
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,730
Oh, he wasn't your customer.

72
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,330
Sorry about that.

73
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,840
Are you okay?

74
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,110
She's fine.

75
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,150
She's always like this.

76
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,070
l better get going.

77
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,550
Thanks, Sakatsu.

78
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,990
lt looks like he's gone.

79
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Let's do this thing, shall we?

80
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,070
Stop it!

81
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,670
Kumi?

82
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,710
This is just wrong!

83
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,710
You wanna join in?

84
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,580
Let's go, Yu.

85
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,240
Yu!

86
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,540
What do you wanna do?

87
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,050
l wanna do it.

88
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,630
Stop...

89
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,770
What's this?

90
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,780
Here we go.

91
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,120
l can't hold it, Sakatsu.
l'm gonna come.

92
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,660
Call me Hozumi.

93
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,290
Hozumi...

94
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,000
lt's Yu's cock juice.

95
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,480
Lick it up.

96
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,770
Ouch!

97
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,700
lt hurts!

98
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,610
lt's not fair.

99
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,320
l wanna shoot it inside you.

100
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,850
Kumi always liked you.

101
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,750
Liked me?

102
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,550
So she doesn't like me now?

103
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,490
Grandma, it's gonna melt
if we don't hurry.

104
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,430
Fireworks?

105
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,490
l knew something bad might happen.

106
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,130
Curse...

107
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,670
lt's a curse!

108
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,410
Nanmaida, nanmaida, nanmaida...

109
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,690
Do you have any regrets about all this?

110
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,720
Why should l?

111
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,690
l'm glad you chose to do this with us.

112
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,970
But l get jealous very easily.

113
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,700
So...

114
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,550
l chose to do this on my own.

115
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,070
l don't care what everybody else
thinks...

116
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,680
...but it wouldn't be bad for
all three of us to be together.

117
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,020
l'll never have sex for money again.

118
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,520
l'll only do it with you.

119
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,560
l wanna have a baby soon.

120
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,070
What?

121
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,030
Stay with me forever and ever!

122
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,610
Okay.

123
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,840
l'm sorry, l fell asleep.

124
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,890
We were watching you sleep.

125
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,180
You looked real cute, Kumi!

126
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,600
Matsui! Do you know what you just did?

127
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,410
l'm running because l know what l did!

128
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,020
Hey you! Come with me.

129
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,390
l'm talking to you!

130
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,720
You're coming with me, right?

131
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,350
Yes.

132
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,930
What's up, Yu?

133
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,470
Matsui, you...

134
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,800
l'm taking you all, as hostages.

135
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,890
l was told he was a
normal college student.

136
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,320
Even a person who seems normal can
suddenly change into a psychopath.

137
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,220
l don't want you to cause any trouble...

138
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,730
Chief, you better listen to this!

139
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,870
What is it?

140
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,910
There's been gunfire.

141
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,280
ls it that gun?

142
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,110
l'm not positive, but
one person has been killed.

143
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,480
The suspect took the hostages
and confined himself in a room.

144
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,320
Find out the number of hostages,
and get some back up!

145
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,420
But we're dealing with just one suspect!

146
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,330
l don't want to think about it...

147
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,700
But if it's that gun,
more people are gonna die.

148
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,480
Shit! l wanna do it before l get caught.

149
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,050
l can't get it up.

150
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,830
Matsui, stop doing this
and give yourself up.

151
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,560
What did you say?

152
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,840
This all started because you...

153
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,760
l got a great idea.

154
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,880
Yu, take your clothes off!

155
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,810
What!

156
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,980
Looking good there.

157
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,950
What are you planning to do, Matsui!

158
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,580
Those are fresh panties.

159
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,090
You should be happy.

160
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,390
Kikuchi! Nakamoto!

161
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,790
Get over here!

162
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,930
lt's all his fault.

163
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,770
Keep doing it until he dies!

164
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,200
l'm sorry.

165
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,070
l'm sorry, Asakura.

166
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,380
You too.

167
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,920
What a weird chick.

168
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,390
Go, go, go!

169
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,770
Find out what you can
and get back to me.

170
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,100
Where's the rest of your team?

171
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,190
Over there.

172
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,170
Hey Misaki!

173
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,490
Suck my cock.

174
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,490
No!

175
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,290
Then l'll kill him.

176
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,310
Nevermind.

177
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,320
No!

178
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,140
No...

179
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,580
Wake up!

180
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,790
Yu!

181
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,550
Yu!

182
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,800
l heard it's a very popular store.

183
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,200
Oh, then why don't the
three of us go there?

184
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,710
l'm sure you two will love it.

185
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,780
Then call me or e-mail me
the day you guys are free.

186
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,540
l'll let you know what day
is best for all of us.

187
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,340
You can't choose a path
where everyone can be happy.

188
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,510
Everyone knows that.

189
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,360
You don't choose a path for others.

190
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,770
But you choose it for your own good.

191
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,110
You choose the path
that is best for you.

192
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,450
You feel it's right, but in
your mind you feel it's wrong.

193
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,820
But you still have to
keep on making choices.

194
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:48,760
You can't go on living
without making any choices.

195
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,480
Things you can grab hold of.

196
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,520
Things you can obtain easily.

197
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,690
You lost those things by
choosing your own path.

198
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,560
Calm scenery.

199
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,020
Quiet everyday life.

200
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,130
Ordinary words.

201
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,630
What do you wish for?

202
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,070
What did you wish for?

203
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,840
Sight that's laid out in front of you.

204
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,910
ls that what you wished for?

205
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,810
But l'm afraid that's reality.

206
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,990
You regret it after losing something.

207
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,650
Or are you blaming someone else?

208
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:51,860
You're the one who screwed things up.

209
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,690
lt was all your fault.

210
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,860
