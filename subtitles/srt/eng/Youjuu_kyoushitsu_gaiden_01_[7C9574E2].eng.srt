1
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,470
You usually don't see a storm this
concentrated at this time of the year.

2
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,710
It's strange.

3
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,810
It's been going on for ten days now.

4
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,850
I get the feeling something
terrible is brewing.

5
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,110
Don't scare me like that, Muneto.

6
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,550
It's like the end of the world.
I've got a bad feeling about this.

7
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,790
Kayo...

8
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,200
I don't want to go home, Muneto.

9
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,160
Captain O.

10
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,530
Analysis results?

11
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,540
The world-wide climatic disturbances
should be improving in the next 24 hours.

12
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,630
However...

13
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,700
However?

14
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,140
We're detecting substances in the rain...

15
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,270
which indicate the growth
of a Demon Beast life form.

16
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,180
What?

17
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,740
Look at the data we gathered from the
last time the Demon Beast appeared.

18
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,860
Probability of a new appearance?

19
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,740
72%. We believe there's the strong
possibility that proto-Demon Beast matter...

20
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,270
found in the asteroid belt was
somehow diverted to the Earth.

21
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,940
How long will it take to grow from its child
form into a full-grown Demon Beast?

22
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,350
From the start of life functions,
we estimate 69 hours.

23
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,050
I'm initiating a search
and destroy mission.

24
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,990
Select a strike team at once!

25
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,780
Yes, ma'am!

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,160
Mother... My life... Mother!

27
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,360
Whew! It's so steamy!

28
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,990
That rain finally cleared up
and now we get this heat!

29
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,690
You just can't win either way!

30
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,380
Ash...

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
ASH!

32
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,340
Wait, please!

33
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,620
That was Ash! But it couldn't be!
Am I seeing things now?

34
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,900
Muneto?

35
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,240
What's wrong?
Didn't you buy anything?

36
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,450
Come on, what's wrong?

37
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,280
Could you please leave
me alone for a while?

38
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,750
Silly Muneto.

39
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,860
I can't do anything
to fight the Demon Beast!

40
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,490
I don't have what it
takes to be an I MO agent!

41
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,930
I can't even protect Kayo, the girl I love.

42
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,710
I don't have the power
to do anything at all.

43
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,970
Enough of that!

44
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,600
Ash!

45
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,970
Nothing ever comes of despair.

46
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,110
Everything my sisters and I know comes from
our training to destroy the Demon Beast.

47
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,150
But what we need... is the power that
comes from protecting the one you love!

48
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,480
My sisters don't know what
that sort of power is like.

49
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,990
Ash!

50
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,000
Just once. Show me the joy
you give Kayo when you love her!

51
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,400
As though she were here
with you instead of me!

52
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,330
That's all I wanted from you.

53
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,770
Ash!

54
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,740
BB! Dee! Move out!

55
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,370
Sis!

56
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,010
Ash...

57
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,980
Sis!

58
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,040
Muneto...

59
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,140
Muneto!

60
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,410
Sis!

61
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,840
ASH!

62
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,990
M... Mother!

63
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,210
Mother-r-r-r...

64
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,480
A-A-A-A-A-ASH!

65
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,420
Sis!

66
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,020
Ash! You can't die!

67
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,050
But Ash was... She was...

68
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,920
Sis...

69
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,870
Captain O.

70
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,880
Agents BB and Dee, reporting for duty.

71
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,450
Sis?

72
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,990
Ash was the greatest warrior...

73
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,590
the Interplanetary Mutual
Observation Agency ever had.

74
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,690
That remains true even now.

75
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,670
And now we need her once again.

76
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,790
But... She's... She's...

77
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,340
She was killed along
with the Demon Beast!

78
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,740
Which means we have to resurrect her.

79
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,800
Captain O!

80
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,210
There's a strong probability that a new
Demon Beast has come to life on Earth.

81
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,440
No. I should say we're certain of it.

82
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,780
A new... Demon Beast?

83
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,140
I have come to the conclusion
that Ash is the only warrior...

84
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,090
who would have any chance against it.

85
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,220
You can't bring somebody back
from the dead!

86
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,450
We have a duty to avenge her!

87
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,720
Please, send us out after it!

88
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,860
You two would have
no chance against it.

89
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,030
What's that?

90
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,730
Spermia, which we recovered
from Ash's body after she died.

91
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,280
"Spermia"?

92
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,310
A sort of embryonic cell nucleus.

93
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,680
The genetic sequences containing
Ash's individual personality and memories...

94
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,220
which we cultured from her cells.

95
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,410
Ash's?

96
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,850
It contains all of
Ash's combat memories.

97
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,690
While we were studying the secrets
of the Demon Beast's life functions...

98
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,390
after we killed it before, we removed
Ash's body from inside it...

99
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,860
and learned enough to create this
proto-nucleus: The spermia cell.

100
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,820
What do you mean?

101
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,400
Rudolf Steiner, a famous Earth scientist
active during the early 20th century...

102
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,140
theorized the existence of the spermia
of space creatures which might survive...

103
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,200
while encased in dead organic cells,
which would fall to Earth.

104
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,640
He believed that people who were
born and died on other worlds...

105
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,310
might leave behind spermia which
would then drift through space...

106
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,940
fall to Earth, and be reborn.

107
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,020
You mean people could be reborn from
meteor material or something like that?

108
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,560
Most people who carry these
sleeping memory sequences...

109
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,090
within their brains will never
awaken their old memories.

110
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,190
However, these memory sequences
can be concentrated by certain life forms...

111
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,600
allowing the possibility to
resurrect the old personality.

112
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,660
You mean the Demon Beast?

113
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,770
Exactly. And there's also the possibility
that the activation of the old personality...

114
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,970
in the mind of a human
could produce a new being...

115
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,340
with power nearly as great as
the Demon Beast's.

116
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,070
Then you mean Sis really
can be resurrected?

117
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,580
Someone on Earth has
the same spermia root as Ash.

118
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,210
If you implant this memory spermia into
them, and assuming no rejection occurs...

119
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,660
the old and new personalities
within them may merge...

120
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,590
to produce a being with
extraordinary abilities.

121
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,590
But, that person...

122
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,090
We'd never be able to find her!

123
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,390
Listen.

124
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,000
I saw her! I saw Ash!
I thought she was dead!

125
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,660
Has she been sent down here again
without you telling me?

126
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,500
Muneto?

127
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,200
Explain this to me!
What's going on?

128
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,140
She acted like she didn't
even recognize me!

129
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,940
I can't stand not knowing!
What's going on?

130
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,210
BB, Dee. Do you understand?

131
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,050
That person he saw carries
Ash's spermia root.

132
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,730
Ash, the I MOA's greatest
and most highly trained warrior.

133
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,930
This, along with her old memories,
should be enough to revive her.

134
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,800
Sis!

135
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,580
Your mission is to resurrect something
more than this holographic image of her.

136
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:03,310
However, the person Muneto saw knows
nothing of the spermia she's carrying.

137
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,850
She has her own memories,
of her own experiences on Earth.

138
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,580
We're only one step away from the
complete rebirth of the Demon Beast.

139
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,090
However, you cannot forcibly destroy
this woman's current personality.

140
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,630
It could very well kill her!

141
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,640
I know this is hard for you, but there's
no other way to fight the Demon Beast.

142
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,270
Once she's resurrected,
give this equipment to Ash.

143
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,840
It will tap into her body's
power to help protect her.

144
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,780
Remember, this will only work for Ash.

145
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,850
If either of you tries to use it, it'll drain
your life energy in less than a minute.

146
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,650
BB, moving out!

147
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,690
Dee, moving out!

148
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,680
May your mission be successful.

149
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,720
Mother... Mother...

150
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,500
Man, this run tonight was a wash-out!

151
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,400
We had the home-court advantage
and she still made mincemeat out of us!

152
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,210
Dammit! I haven't seen
Cat's Eye race in three days...

153
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,370
and I'm starting to get
withdrawal symptoms!

154
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,670
Ohhhh!

155
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,410
I guess we need turbochargers, too.
Three minutes was all we needed!

156
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,580
Oh, God! Oh, Miki!
Oh, Great Cat's Eye!

157
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,750
Bless us with your presence!

158
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,980
Hm?

159
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,200
What's this? Oh, it's cute!

160
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,230
What is it?

161
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,530
Ew, it's gross!

162
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,040
It's so cute!
It's still just a baby!

163
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,710
Emi, drop it.
It's a dirty little bug!

164
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,940
Tsugiko? Oh, you don't understand.

165
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,000
Butterflies start out as caterpillars
when they're babies.

166
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,780
Never mind.
Just chuck the damned thing!

167
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,050
Hello? What? Cat's Eye?

168
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,790
Just be a good boy. You might get
run over if you crawl around here.

169
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,480
What, again? And I was
enjoying myself tonight, too!

170
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,150
I get tingly just seeing her!

171
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,930
Faster! Fast as the wind!

172
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,890
And once again I only get
a quick glimpse of her.

173
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,320
Definitely gotta save up for a turbo.

174
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,570
Ohhh, if I could see her
up close just once...

175
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,580
If I could joyride with
Miki, I could die happy!

176
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,640
I just don't get how she can go so fast...

177
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,450
Wha... What the...

178
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,320
Hey! Stop it!

179
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,000
What's...

180
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,840
Mother! Mother, where are you?

181
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,060
Mother! Mother!

182
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,330
BB... Dee...

183
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,100
It's been a while, Muneto.

184
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,540
Where's Kayo?

185
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,050
She said she felt sick and went
in the next room to lie down.

186
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,450
I couldn't quite get what
the Agency told me before.

187
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,820
Can you really bring Ash back to life?

188
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,950
We have to bring her back.

189
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,590
That's why we came.

190
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:34,060
Anyway, can you tell us anything else
about that girl you saw who looks like Ash?

191
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,060
Just that her name's Miki,
though she goes by...

192
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,470
the name Cat's Eye to all
the bikers around here.

193
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,940
She's got a huge following of girl bikers.
That's all the guys at the bike shop knew.

194
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,940
A lone wolf, huh?

195
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,820
Sis would have been like that if she
was born and grew up on Earth.

196
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:57,320
I've been looking for that Miki girl
at that bike shop ever since I saw her...

197
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,660
but she hasn't come back there.

198
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,490
I see. The guys at the bike
shop may be hiding her.

199
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,060
Hm. She's apparently been attracting more
and more girl riders as groupies lately.

200
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,930
They said it was getting
to be a real pain for her.

201
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,170
I hope we're in time.

202
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,100
Dee?

203
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,970
The Demon Beast...
may have been reborn.

204
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,780
What? Captain O never said
anything about that to me!

205
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,180
Shh! You weren't to be briefed
on it until we both got down here.

206
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,120
Headquarters doesn't want Kayo under
any more pressure than necessary.

207
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,760
Kayo!

208
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,920
Kayo!

209
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,330
No. No!

210
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,760
Kayo, what's wrong?

211
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,430
Get away from me!

212
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,460
Kayo...

213
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,510
Mother!

214
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,170
No! I hear it! I hear it!

215
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,940
Dee! Tranquilize her!

216
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,140
Mm!

217
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,950
Kayo!

218
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,920
The Demon Beast has been reborn.

219
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,930
What did you say?

220
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,190
It's a voice only Kayo can hear.

221
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:14,830
The horrible birth cries which are carried
back to the womb which first bore it!

222
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,290
Kayo!

223
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,630
It's been secretly reborn somewhere.

224
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,730
HQ estimates that we have a little time
before it reaches full maturity.

225
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,070
But it's still just an estimate!

226
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,180
The news! If anything unusual happens,
it's bound to show up on the news!

227
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,150
And now for the final news for today.

228
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,160
The rapid surge in the activities
of girl cycle gangs in the city...

229
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,160
and out to the suburbs has
become a real problem.

230
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,420
They all wear a yellow cat's eye insignia
on the backs of their riding suits.

231
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:54,430
This is the mark of Cat's Eye, the lone wolf
rider these girls seem to worship like a god.

232
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,070
At the least sight of her,
these self-proclaimed followers...

233
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,480
will ride after her to try and join
Cat's Eye, causing accidents as they do.

234
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,570
And this mania seems to be spreading.

235
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,120
We managed to capture some
footage of the elusive rider.

236
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,080
Her name is Miki.

237
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,990
Outside of that, this mysterious
highway star remains an enigma.

238
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,560
Sis!

239
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,790
The girls' frenzied racing
in and out of the city...

240
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,930
is ruining the sleep of
the local community.

241
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,900
40 of these so-called "teams"
have been confirmed...

242
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,870
although the actual number of them
may be much higher.

243
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,470
Authorities are calling on
Cat's Eye to end the noise...

244
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,070
and say they are close to
taking her into custody.

245
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,130
BB! Dee!

246
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,740
We have to try and catch her.

247
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,750
Now that the Demon Beast has been
reborn, we don't have a moment to lose!

248
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,950
BB! Dee! Take me with you!

249
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,990
Stay with Kayo. That's your duty!

250
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,920
BB... Dee...

251
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,970
Looks like Emi's home.

252
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,010
Emi!

253
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,140
Emi!

254
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,280
Emi?

255
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,320
Emi!

256
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,160
Help!

257
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,000
Help me!

258
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,340
Mother!

259
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,350
Mother!

260
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:02,030
Mother! Where are you? MOTHER!

261
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,060
MOTHER!

262
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,070
Give me strength! MOTHER!

263
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,810
Namae mo Shiranai mama
I may not have known your name

264
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,110
Koi o Shiteita
but loved you anyway

265
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,490

Even at those times

I thought fate was against me

I had no warning of it

but I met you anyway

269
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,740

Maybe it's that feeling of calm

270
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:55,210

00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,150

and calmly meet you again

273
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:11,890

I know I'll see your

274
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,160
