1
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:28,201
It's been a while, Cain.
How have you been?.

2
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,999
Fine, thank you. I'm pleased to see...

3
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:36,207
...you have returned safely.

4
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:37,611
Thank you.

5
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:43,412
Charlotte, you're now more
beautiful than ever.

6
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:48,817
Cain, how has your time as a Lord been?.

7
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:53,622
I haven't been very sucessful
in my role as Lord.

8
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:56,090
Is that so?.

9
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,478
I'll go and prepare some tea.
It will just be a moment.

10
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:14,877
Thank you. But I simply came by
to tell you that I've returned.

11
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:58,358
Money means nothing to us.
These woods are all we live for.

12
00:01:59,263 --> 00:02:01,322
What a stubborn race you are!.

13
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:07,697
By joining us you would profit
beyond your wildest imaginations.

14
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:13,105
I understand though. Unfortunately,
you leave me no other choice.

15
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,478
Stop!. You are in Norland now.
I won't allow this.

16
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:23,319
You...You're...

17
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:24,813
Tsubaki Ohouin.

18
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:31,651
Whoa there!. OK. It's only a matter
of time now anyway.

19
00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:34,887
When I become King, I'll burn you
and your woods to the ground.

20
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:38,967
Then your buried treasure will be mine.

21
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:50,172
What did he mean by
"buried treasure"?.

22
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,623
The dwarves won't admit it, but there's
definitely buried treasure in those woods

23
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:10,261
If we had that treasure, we could
strengthen our forces.

24
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:13,059
..and most likely turn the tide
of this war in our favor.

25
00:03:13,937 --> 00:03:17,600
Ann, what do you think?. Are they
really hiding treasure?.

26
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:20,666
Um...Well...

27
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:24,905
I have read several old texts that
mention hidden treasures.

28
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:27,141
But there's no way to tell if
they're true or not.

29
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:30,445
Who cares if it's true or not?.!.

30
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:32,814
Have a look for yourself
what we'll be facing!

31
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:35,783
How are we going to defend
ourselves against huge tanks?.!

32
00:03:36,193 --> 00:03:38,058
This could be the last straw.

33
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:43,032
If the dwarves have hidden treasure,
they should help us out.

34
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,427
Isn't it the Lord's job to convince them?.

35
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:52,068
Hey, I haven't seen Tia around.
What happened to her?.

36
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,146
She's been gone for the last three days,
for personal reasons.

37
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:58,779
Personal!?.

38
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,283
Yes. And she might
not be coming back.

39
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:04,386
She's not the issue here!

40
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:07,481
You have to make a decision!

41
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:10,451
Yeah...Buried treasure...

42
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:12,487
Boss!

43
00:04:20,537 --> 00:04:23,563
Charlotte. So you're in here.

44
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,907
Father...

45
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:28,002
You look bored. Do you want to go hunting...

46
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:29,345
...Iike we used to?.

47
00:04:29,513 --> 00:04:31,344
Definitely! But father...

48
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:35,409
What do you think of the war
between Norland and Tedmond?.

49
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:40,419
Just thinking about it gives me a headache.

50
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:45,651
Either Francis or Cain will succeed me as King.

51
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:48,891
For that reason, I must remain neutral.

52
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,000
That is why I cannot get
involved in that matter.

53
00:04:54,738 --> 00:04:55,705
That's true.

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,340
But that will all be over soon
enough, Charlotte.

55
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:04,642
Your twentieth birthday is approaching.

56
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:05,748
Yes.

57
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:11,351
Cain has exceeded every expectation
in his role as Lord.

58
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:16,215
But Norland is the underdog in this war.

59
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:19,924
At this rate, it looks like Francis will win.

60
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:24,089
Charlotte, you do not have
a problem with that?.

61
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:30,734
As per the arrangement, I will marry whoever
has been the better Lord of his land.

62
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,302
This not a personal matter. It is
for the best of the country.

63
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:37,713
Really?.

64
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:48,684
I'm home!

65
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,593
Tia, what happened to you?.
You're all covered in dirt.

66
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:54,887
Where have you been
in this time of crisis?.

67
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:59,265
Don't pick on me! You don't know
what I've been doing!

68
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:04,834
I was trying to lend a helping hand
by spying on the Tedmond.

69
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:06,275
What!?.

70
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,736
Look at this.

71
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:12,871
I see. They're deploying their troops
along the Eastern valley front.

72
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,910
This is great! Now we know all
about their military installations.

73
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:20,885
Now we know where to strike. It will
be quick and less dangerous.

74
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:24,782
They belive they've already won the war.

75
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:30,894
They spend their nights drinking and
having sex, so their security is very lax.

76
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:32,759
Tia, I really appreciate this.

77
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:38,036
It's nothing compared to the kindness
you've shown me.

78
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:40,309
Let me handle this now.

79
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:42,837
I'll create a strategy that will win this for us.

80
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:44,075
I trust you, Tsubaki!

81
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:44,977
Yes.

82
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:55,758
First, we have to rescue the
prisoners from the jails.

83
00:06:56,293 --> 00:07:01,560
Than we'll attack the armory
and take as many weapons
as we can. We'll burn the rest.

84
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:05,260
Our primary targets will be their tanks.

85
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:21,680
Quickly, everyone. We're
here to rescue you!

86
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:47,600
You! Sandra...

87
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,940
Well look who's here. The young
Lord from next door.

88
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,846
We've got to stop meeting like this.

89
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:01,483
Bring her too, Tsubaki.

90
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,701
Tsubaki, there are no tanks here.

91
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,061
There's nothing more we can do then. Let's
get out of here before they notice anything.

92
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:24,441
What?. Norland's army?.

93
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:25,403
Yes.

94
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:29,514
Those peasants?.! They're still trying to resist?.

95
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:31,448
We'll put an end to that soon enough.

96
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,142
Oh, you're finally awake?.
You've been asleep for three days.

97
00:08:56,946 --> 00:09:00,177
But please get some more rest.
You were hurt pretty badly.

98
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,913
Most people would have died
from wounds like yours.

99
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:05,851
Why did you save me?.

100
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:11,120
My Lord will not alow anyone to suffer,
no matter what the circumstances.

101
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:13,820
It's natural to want help people.

102
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,701
Well, eat up and get some more
sleep. You need to heal.

103
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:41,217
Hey, I heard you'd woken up.

104
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:45,485
I didn't ask you to save me, so
don't expect me to thank you.

105
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:49,621
As a prisoner, I have a right to
food and proper care.

106
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,062
You're right. Good. Since
you feel that way I guess
you'll be leaving soon.

107
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,333
The truth is that I really don't
have the time to punish you.

108
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:04,271
Normally we'd put you on trial but...

109
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:07,046
...if you promise to never loot another town...

110
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:10,643
I will use my authority to simply banish you.

111
00:10:13,056 --> 00:10:16,082
Are you trying to show me mercy?.
How sweet!

112
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:20,785
I may be a woman but I'm a bandit leader!

113
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,761
I have my pride!

114
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,233
I'm not afraid to die.

115
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:32,263
You should end this now.
Justice will be served.

116
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:36,543
Otherwise you'll come to regret
it someday, Sir Lord!

117
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,245
If you want to kill me, do it now.

118
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,867
W...what?.

119
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,995
You fool! What the hell are you doing?.!

120
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:03,330
Listen to me! You bandit bitch!

121
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:08,134
You just spoke of your pride...as a bandit leader.

122
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:10,445
I may be young but I am
the Lord here.

123
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:12,708
I have my pride
as well...as leader of these people.

124
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:17,677
You don't know what justice is.
Humans don't live for justice.

125
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,716
Justice exists FOR humans.

126
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:28,058
It's not just an ideal. Everyone
can live peacefully.

127
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:32,266
There is such a thing as true justice.
As a Lord, I truly believe that!

128
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:35,235
If you die, do you think
people will be happy?.

129
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:38,769
Are you only happy by making
other people unhappy?.

130
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:42,774
That's not true, is it?.
There's just no way!

131
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:56,682
Damn! Damn you! There's no
other Lord quite like you.

132
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,020
No. There was one before.
You're the second.

133
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:03,423
Second?.

134
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:09,196
You're just like my father.

135
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:12,741
Your...father?.!

136
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,817
My father was a great Lord,
who was loved by his people.

137
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:36,588
But he was too kind and trusting of others.

138
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,169
He was betrayed by his closest
and most trusted aide.

139
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:03,984
My father was made a prisoner by
his own people and died in jail.

140
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:07,489
My family was split up and we
were banished from the land.

141
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:10,830
I was very young and sold to slavery.

142
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:14,634
I bounced from place to place and
ended up in this business.

143
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:24,071
But I loved my father.

144
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:27,683
As a Lord, he was too honest.

145
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:33,145
But he put his people, his family...
me... ahead of himself.

146
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:37,487
I don't know a human being alive
who's greater than he was.

147
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:40,895
Sandra...

148
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:18,961
You poor thing...

149
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:44,221
That feels weird. My whole body's tingling...

150
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:47,723
Awesome! You taste so good!

151
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:52,697
Don't worry! Relax and enjoy this!

152
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:59,264
Wow! This is great! I'm so hot!

153
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:04,546
I'm coming!

154
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:28,165
How's this?. Feel good?.

155
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:30,230
Fantastic!

156
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:37,106
This feels amazing!

157
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:39,607
Not yet...

158
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,079
If you keep that up I'm going to...

159
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:57,160
Damn! You came a lot!

160
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:06,166
How's this, Sandra?. Feel good?.

161
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:07,505
You're awesome!

162
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:12,246
For me too! This is the best!

163
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:20,755
So deep... In me! Rubbing my... back walls!

164
00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:24,482
More! More!

165
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:32,930
So hot! My body is...burning up!

166
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:39,939
That's it! I'm gonna come! I'm gonna come!

167
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:41,637
Good. Let's come together!

168
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:57,693
I'm coming!!

169
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:34,690
Shortly thereafter...The day of the final battle arrived.

170
00:17:34,864 --> 00:17:36,923
We had taken our prisoners
back and stolen their weapons...

171
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,969
So that boosted our military strength, but...

172
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,502
...we were still overpowered by the enemy forces.

173
00:17:46,742 --> 00:17:51,270
Norland's back was to the wall.

174
00:17:57,253 --> 00:17:58,777
So it ends with a bang!

175
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,386
Aim for the dwarves' woods.

176
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:03,025
Fire!

177
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,433
I'm truly sorry about everything.

178
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:17,938
But we'll still have Francis' head for this.

179
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:21,706
Let me try my magic.

180
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:26,738
I haven't used it in years, so
I'm not sure if it will help or not, but...

181
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:29,041
Why now, Chiffon?.

182
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:35,922
I'll do whatever I can for the
good people who fight beside me.

183
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:39,260
Chiffon...Thank you.

184
00:18:40,563 --> 00:18:42,997
We'll split up and attack, just like we planned!

185
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:44,231
Chiffon, cover us!

186
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:45,133
Yes.

187
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,842
What's going on?.

188
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:13,251
Shit! But this changes nothing!

189
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:15,558
Onward! Get them!

190
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:39,787
I'm sorry, My Lord. I...

191
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:43,253
It's alright, Chiffon. You did your best!

192
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:45,487
So this it?.

193
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,099
Elise?.

194
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:56,795
What?.!

195
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:07,680
Hey, everybody!

196
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,748
Are those the dwarves?.!

197
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,616
The dwarf army has come to our aid!

198
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:14,846
And don't forget about us!

199
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:19,651
Sandra!

200
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:20,920
It's them!

201
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,337
Damn you all!

202
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:34,908
That day, a miracle happened!

203
00:20:35,678 --> 00:20:39,045
Norland was on the verge
of defeat, but...

204
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,780
...with their help we turned the tables and won!

205
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:52,788
This long war has finally come to an end.

206
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,921
Yes. So many people have been
waiting for this day.

207
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:08,099
I'm finally able to repay the Boss
for all his kindness.

208
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:09,840
What?.

209
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,405
Nothing.

210
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:35,666
The victory made me the
most powerful Lord.

211
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,231
And I was given Charlotte's
hand in marriage.

212
00:21:39,642 --> 00:21:44,807
The dwarves promised me their
hidden treasure to mark the occasion.

213
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:50,518
It is wealth enough to end poverty
and hunger in the entire country.

214
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:57,582
Chiffon will end her role as my advisor
and she'll return to the church.

215
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:03,324
Tsubaki realizes just how many people
I can help when I become King.

216
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:05,831
So she put feelings for me behind her.

217
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:10,230
But she will become the head of the palace guard.

218
00:22:13,008 --> 00:22:15,806
Tia will continue her work on my staff.

219
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:18,639
But we now have a professional chef
so she doesn't cook anymore.

220
00:22:19,248 --> 00:22:21,648
That means I can finally enjoy a decent meal.

221
00:22:23,786 --> 00:22:26,914
Due to their help in the battle
against Tedmond...

222
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:30,322
Sandra and
her bandits got a full pardon.

223
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:34,119
The Emerald left the country to
pursue a new, honest living.

224
00:22:36,966 --> 00:22:38,763
You may kiss the bride.

225
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:18,540
That feels strange...All tickly...

226
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:22,571
No.

227
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:25,446
It's alright. Trust me.

228
00:23:26,015 --> 00:23:26,674
OK.

229
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:34,079
Charlotte, your pussy tastes great!

230
00:23:34,857 --> 00:23:36,518
Your getting really fucking wet!

231
00:23:37,493 --> 00:23:39,688
Please don't say that.

232
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:46,658
I'm coming!

233
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:03,106
I learned about this in bridal class,
but have never done it for real.

234
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:06,085
It's really hard and pretty warm.

235
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:09,618
You've gotta learn how to do it
or we'll have problems.

236
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,685
Move your hand slowly...

237
00:24:12,394 --> 00:24:13,224
Like this?.

238
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:14,961
Yes. That's good.

239
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,365
That's really good. You're doing great.

240
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:33,779
That's fucking fantastic!
If you keep that up, I'll...

241
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:40,980
You don't have to hold it. I'm fine with it.

242
00:24:41,924 --> 00:24:43,118
Are you sure, Charlotte?.!

243
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,066
I'm sorry, Charlotte.

244
00:24:58,807 --> 00:25:01,901
It's alright. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

245
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:04,741
It's not poisonous, right?.

246
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:07,047
Charlotte, I love you.

247
00:25:07,283 --> 00:25:08,215
I love you too.

248
00:25:09,518 --> 00:25:10,416
I'm gonna put it in.

249
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:11,410
O...OK.

250
00:25:16,492 --> 00:25:17,459
It hurts!

251
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,489
Sorry. But it always hurts the first time.

252
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:20,819
It'll feel good soon enough.

253
00:25:21,864 --> 00:25:22,421
Al..Alright.

254
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:27,560
I feel strange.

255
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm burning up inside!

256
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,166
Yeah! It feels wonderful!

257
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:41,883
Awesome! More! More!

258
00:25:41,984 --> 00:25:43,975
That's it, Charlotte. Keep going!

259
00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:49,589
I'm going to...

260
00:25:49,892 --> 00:25:51,291
Charlotte, I love you.

261
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,720
I love you too, Cain.
More than anyone else!

262
00:26:11,413 --> 00:26:12,607
Charlotte?.!

263
00:26:13,816 --> 00:26:16,808
Oops! I'm sorry. Did I wake you?.

264
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:19,279
Well... I was curious...

265
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:22,856
It was getting big while you slept.

266
00:26:23,726 --> 00:26:26,320
Umm...I was hoping we could do it again.

267
00:26:27,363 --> 00:26:30,298
You got it! Let's go, Princess.

268
00:26:35,237 --> 00:26:39,139
Our country grew and prospered. And we
were soon with an heir to the throne.

269
00:26:40,242 --> 00:26:43,803
Although we are kept busy,
we live a wonderful life.

270
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:50,715
And then, someday...
