1
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:34,773
Mom!

2
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:36,208
It's all ready.

3
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:36,375
Got it!
It's all ready.

4
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,672
Got it!

5
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,678
I'm off!

6
00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:39,845
Have a good day.
I'm off!

7
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:40,646
Have a good day.

8
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:41,180
Have a good day.
I'll see you later!

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,808
I'll see you later!

10
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,418
I repeat, I repeat...

11
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:48,511
The suspects are headed toward
the Moto Arashiyama District.

12
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:50,655
Roger!

13
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:02,331
Oh, no! Late again! I've
messed up again.

14
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,996
Under these circumstances, I must
get to class as soon as possible!

15
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:19,746
Takeshi Chimatsuri has just arrived!

16
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,687
What the hell?!

17
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,921
Who the hell are you, punk?
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:35,094
Chimatsuri, they're robbers! Robbers!

19
00:01:36,735 --> 00:01:38,202
Robbers?

20
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:41,305
Chimatsuri!

21
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,408
Do what I say. Otherwise,
I'll kill her. Got it?

22
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,107
Atsuko, if you are a true Japanese girl,

23
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,510
you shall give your life for justice.

24
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:58,086
Don't decide for me! I don't
want to die yet!

25
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:01,317
I know. I won't let you die alone.

26
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:05,597
I will follow you after I kill them.

27
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:09,397
You don't understand at all!
Oh, my God.

28
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,637
I'll shoot her. I really will.

29
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:20,975
Takeshi Chimatsuri, age sixteen.

30
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:23,916
Don't get close!

31
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,417
Physical health, excellent!

32
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,618
Here I come!

33
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,709
Naifu no yona hitomi no okuni

34
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:58,280
Sunda nanika, gamusharani
nigirishimete

35
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:03,988
Hayari nado madowasarezu ni

36
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:09,987
Shinji tsuzuketa style,
just the hungry heart

37
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:15,528
Kutabireta heart ni sae,
Give me fresher mind

38
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:21,465
Samishisa o nigawarai

Tsuyogari ga dokoka niterukara

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,974
Oretachi dake no basho o neraooze

41
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:36,554
Victory over myself

42
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,355
Victory over yourself

43
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:42,283
Victory over myself

44
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:45,531
Oretachi wa kachitsuzuke nakya

45
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:48,022
Victory over myself

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,868
Victory over yourself

47
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:54,534
Victory over burning blood, winning

48
00:03:55,908 --> 00:04:00,072
Kagayaki tai anohito no tame

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,549
Naki wa shinai oretachi no tame

50
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:37,248
Chimatsuri!

51
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:52,286
That was quite a commotion
this morning.

52
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:54,527
Now, one more thing before we get
back to our lesson.

53
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,267
Let me introduce some new
students to you.

54
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:58,797
Girls, come on in and introduce
yourselves to the class.

55
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:05,109
Nice to meet you. I'm Akari Toki.

56
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:08,675
And I'm her sister, Kagiri.
Nice to meet you.

57
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:10,816
Wow, twins.

58
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:11,483
Yeah, and good looking too.
Wow, twins.

59
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:12,882
Yeah, and good looking too.

60
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,320
It's them!

61
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,687
What's wrong, Chimatsuri?
It's them!

62
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:16,779
What's wrong, Chimatsuri?

63
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:18,991
Miss Ayatsugi!

64
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:19,157
Yes, Torai?
Miss Ayatsugi!

65
00:05:19,157 --> 00:05:20,454
Yes, Torai?

66
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,396
Kagiri, how about going to a movie
with me this Sunday?

67
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:30,026
But...I just met you.

68
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:33,929
Hey, Torai, you're awful quick.

69
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:37,073
Don't be so negative. I'm just
being true to my heart.

70
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:40,372
Hey, Kagiri, how about going
with me, instead of Torai?

71
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:43,738
Uemura, what the heck are you doing?

72
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:47,953
Oh, shut up! It doesn't matter
who asked first.

73
00:05:47,953 --> 00:05:49,254
Hey guys, cut it out! Kagiri,
why don't you

74
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:49,454
Hey guys, cut it out! Kagiri,
why don't you

75
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:52,925
forget about these guys and
come out with me?

76
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:55,052
What, Tamahara?! Hey, you!

77
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:59,552
What? Freedom of speech
is one of our rights!

78
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:03,991
Everyone, please wait. You don't
need to fight.

79
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:09,073
Now...

80
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:12,504
I'll go on a date with you.

81
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,146
With who?

82
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:14,813
Me, right?
With who?

83
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:15,609
Me, right?

84
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:22,943
With all of you.

85
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:26,220
With all of us?

86
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:33,754
Now, please, you sort out who is first.

87
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:36,434
Oh, no!

88
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:41,301
What the hell are you doing?!

89
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,476
Ouch! Look, Sis, they said they all
wanted to have a date with me.

90
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,048
High school students need to behave
like high school students!

91
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:59,424
I was just trying to cut the problems
in between short.

92
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:02,526
Ouch!

93
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:05,526
I'm telling you that's the problem!

94
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,090
Violence doesn't solve the problem.

95
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:14,405
A man...

96
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:17,100
Touched me!

97
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,907
My hand is going to rot!

98
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:37,355
I'm so sorry. My sister has a phobia
about being touched by men.

99
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:41,697
Those two are like day and night.

100
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:46,770
Chimatsuri?

101
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:51,798
What are you doing? What are
you here for?

102
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:54,975
You know what. We want it back.

103
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:57,579
It? What is it?

104
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:00,852
Could this be it?

105
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:01,019
That's it. That's our family's sword.
Could this be it?

106
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:03,249
That's it. That's our family's sword.

107
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:06,491
Now, hand it to me, or I'II...

108
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:12,487
Toki, Chimatsuri, this is a classroom,
a place for study!

109
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:18,794
Our mission is to retrieve our
family's heirloom sword.

110
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:20,905
For the last ten years,

111
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,768
we trained in the remote mountains to
defeat Takeshi Chimatsuri.

112
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,845
No one's going to stop me now.

113
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:29,541
What?! You've trained for ten years
just to defeat me?

114
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:35,376
Didn't we live in the mountains
because Dad was transferred?

115
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,152
Ouch! You always hit me!

116
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,006
Allergic to naked women.

117
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:57,908
It sure looks that way.

118
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:03,980
Takeshi Chimatsuri, I challenge you to
a match behind the gym tomorrow.

119
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,107
Don't forget to bring the
sword with you.

120
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:07,452
Kagiri!

121
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:07,953
Yes, Sister?
Kagiri!

122
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:08,920
Yes, Sister?

123
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:10,878
We must go for special training to
prepare for tomorrow's match.

124
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:12,457
Yes!

125
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:12,758
Wait! You two!
Yes!

126
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:14,248
Wait! You two!

127
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:23,596
Ouch! Wait, Sis!

128
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:41,916
Oh, you were old friends of the Toki
twins since you were little?

129
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:44,385
Actually, we're more like old rivals.

130
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:48,992
But the sword originally belonged to
the Toki Family, right?

131
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:54,054
Yeah, thirteen years ago, my father
and their father, Kagemaru...

132
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:00,338
Kagemaru Tki

133
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:03,542
Kagemaru Tki
For my family's honor,
it is my mission to prove

134
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:06,010
Kagemaru Tki
that swordmanship is not the
enemy of the art of the Ninja.

135
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:06,378
Raizo Chimatsuri

136
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:07,879
Raizo Chimatsuri
Swordmanship is a spirit.

137
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:11,616
Raizo Chimatsuri
Sword practice leads to
the path of warriors.

138
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:13,118
Raizo Chimatsuri
That is the way of the sword.

139
00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:13,785
Raizo Chimatsuri

140
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:15,685
Raizo Chimatsuri
One with a pure soul cannot
possibly lose.

141
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:17,788
Nonsense!

142
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:21,481
If I win, I will take Kikuichimonji, your
precious sword as my own.

143
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,786
Understood. And if I win?

144
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:31,969
I'll give you the Toki Family
heirloom sword.

145
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:38,609
So, that's what happened.

146
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:40,678
Okay, I've made up my mind.

147
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:44,983
Atsuko?

148
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:45,150
I'll help you.
Atsuko?

149
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,118
I'll help you.

150
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:50,678
I'm not sure how helpful
I can be though.

151
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:52,579
Atsuko!

152
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:56,895
Thanks!

153
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,796
Wait!
Thanks!

154
00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:57,996
Wait!

155
00:10:57,996 --> 00:10:58,396
Wait!
I'll never forget this for the
rest of my life!

156
00:10:58,396 --> 00:10:59,164
I'll never forget this for the
rest of my life!

157
00:10:59,164 --> 00:10:59,497
Chimatsuri!
I'll never forget this for the
rest of my life!

158
00:10:59,497 --> 00:11:00,828
Chimatsuri!
I'll never forget this for the
rest of my life!

159
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,369
He's allergic to the female body,

160
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:07,031
but he sure doesn't seem to have a
problem when he's happy.

161
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:09,496
What a difficult personality.

162
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:11,642
I got it!

163
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:18,180
Yamaguchi

164
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:24,583
So, what's your remedy for my allergy?

165
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:27,218
Well, the plan is...

166
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,028
The plan is to...

167
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:31,620
I don't have a plan really.

168
00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:33,665
What? The way you said that was so
seductive and mysterious,

169
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:33,965
What? The way you said that was so
seductive and mysterious,

170
00:11:33,965 --> 00:11:36,001
What? The way you said that was so
seductive and mysterious,

171
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,468
I sweated right through.

172
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,193
Here, use this.

173
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:46,845
It's coming!

174
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:47,479
Atsuko, thank you!
It's coming!

175
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:48,571
Atsuko, thank you!

176
00:11:48,914 --> 00:11:51,316
I'll never forget this for the
rest of my life!

177
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:53,876
Thank me some more, Chimatsuri!

178
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:56,848
Closer! Hold me closer!

179
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,157
Like this?

180
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:00,886
Ouch!

181
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:06,822
Atsuko, I'm coming in.

182
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:11,468
Hold me! Hold me tighter!

183
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:14,805
Atsuko!

184
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:20,634
What was I doing?

185
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:22,580
Atsuko!

186
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:22,814
What, Mother?
Atsuko!

187
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:24,049
What, Mother?

188
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:24,215
What, Mother?
Can I trust you? Mother can
trust you, right?

189
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:27,446
Can I trust you? Mother can
trust you, right?

190
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:31,155
Get a grip, Mom. What did you want?

191
00:12:32,524 --> 00:12:33,991
You have visitors.

192
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:39,396
Atsuko told us what happened.
We're here to help.

193
00:12:39,798 --> 00:12:41,299
You can count on us.

194
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:43,961
We've got a perfect remedy for
you in this bag.

195
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:46,003
Remedy?

196
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:50,075
Nothing can happen.

197
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:54,535
She should be safe with her classmate
and teacher there.

198
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:06,983
Okay, Chimatsuri, we have to build up
your resistance to naked women.

199
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:09,318
Look through all of these by tomorrow.

200
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:15,466
Chimatsuri?

201
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:21,635
Torai, do you always read these
dirty magazines?

202
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,943
No way! We got these for Chimatsuri,
right, Teacher?

203
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:30,974
Wow! Oh, my God! They
show everything!

204
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:34,679
I wonder if it feels good? Wow!

205
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,053
Okay, so now you're used to
these a little bit,

206
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:46,731
we'll train you with the real thing next.

207
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:48,733
Teacher, you don't mean that we'II...

208
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,758
That's right. You and I are
going to do it.

209
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:52,570
Now, put this leotard on.

210
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,073
Oh, no! I'm not going to do this.
I'm too embarrassed!

211
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:57,064
It's no big deal. We're going
to do aerobics.

212
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,212
Now, you two turn around while
we change clothes.

213
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:02,679
Yes, Ma'am.

214
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:06,885
Atsuko, I've brought some tea and
cakes for your guests.

215
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:08,648
May I come in?

216
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:20,465
Can I trust you? Can I
really trust you?!

217
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:22,262
Mom, get a hold of yourself!

218
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:24,335
It's not what it looks like,
Mrs. Yamaguchi. Really!

219
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:26,337
Can I... can I still trust you?

220
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:29,641
It sounds like it's getting complicated.

221
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:30,875
Yeah, don't look.

222
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,571
If you look now, things will get
a whole lot worse.

223
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:35,579
Okay, shall we start?

224
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:59,601
I can't do it! I can't take this!

225
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:02,499
Hang in there, just think of
something else.

226
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:04,408
You need to hold on!

227
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:08,005
Okay, I've got it.

228
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:11,609
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,

229
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:16,476
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.

230
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:20,682
So, how are you getting on?

231
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:23,360
He seems to be managing.

232
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,093
Here, Chimatsuri, wipe your
sweat with this.

233
00:15:30,768 --> 00:15:36,104
Thank you!

234
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:39,171
I'll never forget this for the
rest of my life!

235
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:41,941
It's taking effect quicker.

236
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:44,081
Is he chanting some sort of spell?

237
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:45,250
No idea.

238
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:45,850
Here, Chimatsuri. Hold
me tighter! Tighter!
No idea.

239
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,887
Here, Chimatsuri. Hold
me tighter! Tighter!

240
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:51,253
Thank you!

241
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,525
I feel good after my bath.

242
00:16:01,232 --> 00:16:03,826
I'm going to bother Takeshi.

243
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:07,801
What are you doing, Takeshi?

244
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:21,382
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars...

245
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:24,656
What's going on? I can't believe he's

246
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:24,822
What's going on? I can't believe he's

247
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:28,781
so uptight, but reading
dirty magazines.

248
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:39,971
Who do you think will win?

249
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:42,040
Chimatsuri's skill is greater.

250
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,012
Yeah, but Chimatsuri has
that fatal weakness.

251
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:49,479
I know!

252
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,023
Are you ready? Let's go, Kagiri.

253
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,819
Yes, Sister.

254
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,868
Here I go!

255
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,911
It won't affect me. I'll show you the
results of my special training.

256
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:29,551
Don't hold back. Give
him all you've got.

257
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:32,480
Leave it to me.

258
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:47,639
Come on, Chimatsuri!

259
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:49,106
Here...

260
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:56,414
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn!

261
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:57,782
Hey!

262
00:17:57,782 --> 00:17:57,949
Watch it.
Hey!

263
00:17:57,949 --> 00:17:59,246
Watch it.

264
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:06,682
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn!

265
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:17,802
You did it, Kagiri! Good job!

266
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:19,269
Thanks, Sister.

267
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,269
Now the sword is ours again.

268
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:27,206
Wake up, Chimatsuri!

269
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:30,539
Here, wipe your sweat with this!

270
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:44,217
Th... th... thank you!

271
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:47,623
I'll never forget this for
the rest of my life!

272
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:50,535
I can't breathe!

273
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:51,169
Let me go! Let me go!
I can't breathe!

274
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,237
Let me go! Let me go!

275
00:18:53,237 --> 00:18:55,603
Thank you!

276
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,277
You guys!

277
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:03,776
It's finished, isn't it?!

278
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:08,049
Maybe, I hope we'll have some peace
and quiet in class now.

279
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:16,125
I wonder if this is really over?

280
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:19,820
I doubt it.

281
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:29,905
It's been over a week since Akari
and Kagiri came to our school,

282
00:19:32,377 --> 00:19:34,312
but my worries came true.

283
00:19:34,312 --> 00:19:35,779
Takeshi!

284
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,947
I'm taking the sword back today!

285
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,444
Shut up! Take it if you can.

286
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:45,979
Here they go again.

287
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:48,053
Really, they're at it all the time.

288
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,595
Hey, want to bet on who wins?

289
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:52,430
I bet 500 yen on Chimatsuri.

290
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,330
I'm in for 500 yen on the twins.

291
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:59,831
Hey, stop it! They're quite
serious about doing this.

292
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:01,672
Hey, hey, let it go.

293
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:04,842
I bet 500 yen on our teacher,
Miss Ayatsugi.

294
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:06,309
What?

295
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:11,716
Stop it! We've had enough! Homeroom
has already begun.

296
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:13,377
Ouch!

297
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:15,920
See!

298
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,087
You're right!
See!

299
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:17,384
You're right!

300
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:21,551
Day in and day out, don't you get
tired of it?! Geez!

301
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:40,042
I see. Your family runs
an antique store.

302
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:43,870
All these unusual, old items...

303
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:49,251
My late husband had a passion for
antiques and loved collecting them.

304
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,987
Is that so?

305
00:20:51,622 --> 00:20:55,956
Did Takeshi break something again?

306
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:58,727
Oh, no, not today.

307
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,731
Then, what?

308
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:04,502
I'm hoping you could convince Takeshi

309
00:21:04,502 --> 00:21:07,562
to return the Toki's heirloom
sword to them.

310
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:09,407
The sword?

311
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:15,277
Yes, Takeshi and the Toki sisters have
been fighting over it every day.

312
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,615
Someone may get killed one
day if it continues.

313
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,084
Takeshi!

314
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:24,921
No way! I will not give it back.

315
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:27,023
No matter what anyone says!

316
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,781
I will never give it back!

317
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:31,426
I won't! Excuse me!

318
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:34,857
Chimatsuri, wait! Let's talk about
this, Chimatsuri!

319
00:21:38,603 --> 00:21:40,070
Chimatsuri...

320
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,539
Father?

321
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:44,033
Oh no, I'm so late! I bet
Mom's furious!

322
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:57,408
Akari, I don't have time to
deal with you today!

323
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,083
Wait!

324
00:22:59,083 --> 00:22:59,617
Wait!
Wait!

325
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:00,351
Wait!

326
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:04,288
Are you scared, Takeshi Chimatsuri?
Hey, stop! Stop!

327
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:06,051
Wait! Please wait!

328
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:41,759
Big brother!

329
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,159
Takeshi!
Big brother!

330
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,251
Takeshi!

331
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:50,768
There was no reason for you to barge
in while I was taking a bath.

332
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:52,793
I'm not a little girl, you know!

333
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:58,142
This is happening because you refuse
to return the Toki's sword.

334
00:23:58,142 --> 00:24:00,804
What if one of us gets
hurt by accident?

335
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:02,213
Isn't that right, Mom?

336
00:24:02,213 --> 00:24:02,747
Well, if someone gets hurt, it
will be painful, I imagine.
Isn't that right, Mom?

337
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:06,376
Well, if someone gets hurt, it
will be painful, I imagine.

338
00:24:07,018 --> 00:24:09,816
Takeshi, you should return
it as she said.

339
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:12,451
See? Now go return it.

340
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,180
Big brother!

341
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:17,428
Takeshi!

342
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:18,295
Big brother!
Takeshi!

343
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:18,886
Big brother!

344
00:24:37,782 --> 00:24:40,273
Takeshi, I want to talk to you.

345
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:42,347
Open the door. I'm coming in.

346
00:24:44,422 --> 00:24:45,980
It's locked.

347
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:50,116
Takeshi, open the door. Takeshi?

348
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:54,694
I'm going to get mad, Takeshi.
Answer me, Takeshi.

349
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:56,866
Takeshi?

350
00:25:13,317 --> 00:25:14,807
Akari Toki...

351
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:17,021
Yes!

352
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:17,388
How long has it been since you
transferred to Arashiyama High?
Yes!

353
00:25:17,388 --> 00:25:21,586
How long has it been since you
transferred to Arashiyama High?

354
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:25,691
I guess it's been about a week.

355
00:25:26,864 --> 00:25:30,129
Shut up! How dare you call
yourself a Toki?

356
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:32,136
You returned empty-handed
again today!

357
00:25:32,136 --> 00:25:35,264
You lack practice! Lack of practice!
Lack of practice!

358
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:40,241
Oh well, Mother, please don't
be so tough on Akari.

359
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:43,114
She's only a teenager.

360
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:44,615
You shut up!

361
00:25:44,615 --> 00:25:47,952
Kagemaru, because you were not
good enough in the first place,

362
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:50,921
Raizo Chimatsuri stole
the family sword!

363
00:25:53,557 --> 00:25:54,759
Really!

364
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,226
Wait a minute! I've got it!

365
00:25:57,394 --> 00:26:02,533
Akari, didn't you say you
have a field trip tomorrow?

366
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:04,001
Yes!

367
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:06,203
Will Takeshi be there?

368
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:07,705
Yes!

369
00:26:07,705 --> 00:26:09,468
Good, good.

370
00:26:19,683 --> 00:26:21,412
The proliferation of nuclear weapons,

371
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,581
the fear of a major earthquake,
unusual weather patterns...

372
00:26:25,222 --> 00:26:27,291
There are many threats.

373
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,589
You are living in a very difficult time.

374
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:32,663
In order to survive such hardships,

375
00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:35,996
it's imperative for you to know
what to do in a disaster.

376
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:41,231
Today's field trip focuses
on survival training.

377
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:43,903
We'll start with food preparation first.

378
00:26:44,975 --> 00:26:46,110
Look, a bunny rabbit.

379
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,477
It's so cute.
Look, a bunny rabbit.

380
00:26:46,477 --> 00:26:47,569
It's so cute.

381
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:56,353
You idiot! Hurry up and go
inside its left.

382
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:58,753
Who said, "I'll take care of it"?

383
00:27:04,662 --> 00:27:07,859
What the hell are you two doing?
This isn't a battle zone.

384
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:12,561
What? We were trying to
get food for survival.

385
00:27:14,872 --> 00:27:17,932
Excuse me, but this area is designated
as a wildlife preserve.

386
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:20,343
Hunting is forbidden here.

387
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:23,976
Then, what are we supposed to eat?

388
00:27:25,749 --> 00:27:28,775
Listen, animals aren't the only
food source here.

389
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,815
It's possible to eat plants, roots,
nuts and some grasses.

390
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:36,923
You two simply have too much energy.

391
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:43,899
Now, there. It's perfect.

392
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:46,361
What is it, Sister?

393
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,237
Wait and see.

394
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:05,421
What do you think?

395
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:15,392
What? Where are you, Sister?
What happened?

396
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,066
What are you doing there?
Here! I'm over here!

397
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:25,038
What's going on?

398
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:28,501
Grandma taught me the Toki
family's secret potion.

399
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:33,276
If you drink it, it will camouflage
your body for a while.

400
00:28:34,551 --> 00:28:36,280
It's called the magic of
the Seventh Elixir.

401
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:44,360
Miss Ayatsugi has gone
a bit overboard.

402
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:48,392
Yeah, "Go fetch some water
if you have all that energy."

403
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:51,200
Anything wrong?

404
00:28:51,535 --> 00:28:53,025
Watch out, Torai!

405
00:28:56,006 --> 00:28:57,837
That Akari, she never stops.

406
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:06,912
What? I thought I sensed
something over here.

407
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:15,825
That's strange.

408
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:22,962
Chimatsuri!

409
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:26,936
What?

410
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:35,967
She disappeared!

411
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:43,142
What? Seventh Elixir?

412
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:46,088
Yeah, it's one of the Toki
family's potions.

413
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:49,994
If you drink it, you can camouflage
your body for a while.

414
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:51,723
I see.

415
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:55,925
Wait, I couldn't see clearly,
but that means Akari is...

416
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:58,965
Naked!

417
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:07,304
Chimatsuri, I'll help you a lot this time.

418
00:30:07,678 --> 00:30:08,872
You are so weird!

419
00:30:12,016 --> 00:30:13,317
What's that?

420
00:30:13,317 --> 00:30:13,517
Leave this to me.
What's that?

421
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:14,518
Leave this to me.

422
00:30:14,518 --> 00:30:14,818
It's an infrared sensor.
It senses body heat.

423
00:30:14,818 --> 00:30:18,015
It's an infrared sensor.
It senses body heat.

424
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:20,724
This way!

425
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:24,592
Impossible, I'm completely invisible.

426
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:27,798
There's no mistake. She's nearby.

427
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:29,527
I can sense someone over here too.

428
00:30:33,737 --> 00:30:36,831
She's over here! I know I'm close,
so close.

429
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:41,912
I know I'm close, so close. What's this
soft, round thing like a bun?

430
00:30:41,912 --> 00:30:42,112
I know I'm close, so close. What's this
soft, round thing like a bun?

431
00:30:42,112 --> 00:30:45,138
I know I'm close, so close. What's this
soft, round thing like a bun?

432
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,250
A man touched me!

433
00:30:54,124 --> 00:30:55,591
Torai?

434
00:30:57,528 --> 00:30:58,995
Legs?!

435
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,096
Oh no, the potion is wearing off.

436
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:11,770
They're awfully late. I wonder
what happened?

437
00:31:13,544 --> 00:31:15,011
It can't be!

438
00:31:21,218 --> 00:31:23,083
Sister, please wait for me!

439
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:26,412
What was that?

440
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:33,461
What are we going to do now, Sister?

441
00:31:34,665 --> 00:31:36,496
Now, we have no choice.

442
00:31:37,134 --> 00:31:38,802
Kagiri, I need your help.

443
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:40,269
Yes, Sister!

444
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,244
I can't do anything so sneaky!

445
00:31:47,244 --> 00:31:48,711
Idiot! Have you forgotten?

446
00:31:49,813 --> 00:31:53,249
Deception is a ninja's specialty,
isn't it?

447
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,413
Yes, Sister!

448
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:04,694
Sorry to drag you out for my
shopping, Chimatsuri.

449
00:32:05,129 --> 00:32:07,120
No problem. I'm happy to
come with you.

450
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:23,940
Boy, I am getting hungry. Aren't you?

451
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:28,143
Hey, Atsuko! Where'd she go?

452
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:32,751
Sorry, sorry. My shoelace came untied.

453
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:38,483
So, do you think you could
show it to me?

454
00:32:38,795 --> 00:32:40,330
Show you what?

455
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,958
You know, the sword you are
all fussing over.

456
00:32:43,634 --> 00:32:45,465
Oh, that, just a minute.

457
00:32:47,204 --> 00:32:49,900
Takeshi, you'll be dead once you
pull out the sword.

458
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:52,643
Here it is.

459
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:54,110
Now's my chance!

460
00:32:55,412 --> 00:32:56,180
Torai!

461
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,914
I can't leave you alone for a minute.
Torai!

462
00:32:56,914 --> 00:32:57,903
I can't leave you alone for a minute.

463
00:32:58,448 --> 00:32:59,316
On a date?

464
00:32:59,316 --> 00:32:59,950
Hey, no way. We were just shopping.
On a date?

465
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,612
Hey, no way. We were just shopping.

466
00:33:04,054 --> 00:33:06,249
What's wrong, Atsuko?
You look pale.

467
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:10,556
A man...

468
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:13,593
Touched me!

469
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,167
Atsuko!

470
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:21,905
You're...

471
00:33:21,905 --> 00:33:22,072
Ah, I've been found out!
You're...

472
00:33:22,072 --> 00:33:23,369
Ah, I've been found out!

473
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,107
Stop!

474
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:30,870
Hey, stop!

475
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:35,885
Hello, Chimatsuri. You know you'll hurt
yourself rushing around like that.

476
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:37,620
Teacher!

477
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:43,527
I knew it!

478
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:44,261
Damn!
I knew it!

479
00:33:44,261 --> 00:33:44,528
Damn!

480
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:45,028
Damn!
Stop!

481
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:45,995
Stop!

482
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,244
An arrow?

483
00:34:03,747 --> 00:34:05,214
We have taken Atsuko
Yamaguchi hostage.

484
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:08,950
If you want to see her alive again,
bring the sword to the Toki castle.

485
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:10,720
Signed, Akari and Kagiri.

486
00:34:14,891 --> 00:34:16,358
Atsuko!

487
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,227
A dream?

488
00:35:19,556 --> 00:35:23,686
This is where Raizo and Kagemaru
battled for the sword.

489
00:36:08,305 --> 00:36:10,273
So, that's why.

490
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,251
The sword reminds him of his father.

491
00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:36,199
Good job, girls. If we're holding his
girl hostage,

492
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:39,202
Takeshi won't have any choice but to
come here.

493
00:36:39,202 --> 00:36:40,669
Exactly.

494
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:44,902
Once he enters the castle, he's in
our hands.

495
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:50,978
With the best traps in the world,

496
00:36:51,982 --> 00:36:56,476
we'll torture him as we please!

497
00:37:02,826 --> 00:37:05,659
Boy, it hasn't changed a bit.

498
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,231
I remember I used to come to play
here all the time.

499
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:18,864
I forgot about the traps hidden
throughout the castle.

500
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:25,414
He fell into the trap.

501
00:37:25,882 --> 00:37:27,617
Akari, Kagiri, go!

502
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:29,084
Yes!

503
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,683
What's this?! Damn!

504
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:47,867
Oh no, this doesn't look good.
I better find an exit soon.

505
00:37:49,372 --> 00:37:50,073
Hello...

506
00:37:50,073 --> 00:37:50,874
Mr. Toki? What?
Hello...

507
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:52,364
Mr. Toki? What?

508
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:58,270
I know Granny and the girls planned
this, but I feel a bit responsible.

509
00:37:58,915 --> 00:38:00,382
Really?

510
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:05,188
Takeshi, it's been so long.
You've grown so much.

511
00:38:05,188 --> 00:38:06,022
Mrs. Toki?!

512
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:06,690
This way!
Mrs. Toki?!

513
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,486
This way!

514
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:13,286
But I thought you and my father
were enemies?

515
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:19,991
How can I explain this?

516
00:38:20,403 --> 00:38:22,769
There's all kinds of friendship.

517
00:38:25,575 --> 00:38:28,100
Takeshi, a cup of tea?

518
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:30,772
No, thank you. I'm in a bit of a hurry.

519
00:38:34,684 --> 00:38:39,422
Mr. And Mrs. Toki, see you later.

520
00:38:39,422 --> 00:38:41,151
Wait, Takeshi!

521
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:43,988
Well, since it's all prepared, would
you like a cup of tea, Honey?

522
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:46,092
Sure...

523
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,699
Did we give Granny too much control
of the girls' education?

524
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:54,470
Chimatsuri!

525
00:38:58,475 --> 00:38:59,942
They're late.

526
00:39:01,912 --> 00:39:03,402
Yes!

527
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:10,814
Damn! Where's the exit?!

528
00:39:11,755 --> 00:39:15,592
Do you think it's okay to use this
without Grandmother's permission?

529
00:39:15,592 --> 00:39:17,753
We have no choice. We've got
to go for it, Kagiri!

530
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:19,495
Yes, Sister!

531
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,897
Go for it!

532
00:39:28,572 --> 00:39:30,039
Takeshi!

533
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,907
Atsuko!

534
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:40,951
Kagiri!

535
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:41,751
Sister!
Kagiri!

536
00:39:41,751 --> 00:39:42,445
Sister!

537
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,034
Those idiots!

538
00:39:58,034 --> 00:39:58,335
Sister!
Those idiots!

539
00:39:58,335 --> 00:39:58,902
Sister!

540
00:39:58,902 --> 00:39:59,536
Sister!
Kagiri!

541
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:00,366
Kagiri!

542
00:40:00,637 --> 00:40:02,628
It won't stop!

543
00:40:11,848 --> 00:40:13,315
Ouch!

544
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,603
Atsuko!

545
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:50,686
Granny!

546
00:40:52,055 --> 00:40:56,617
Takeshi, my sword! Give
me my sword back.

547
00:40:57,994 --> 00:41:01,361
Give me my sword.

548
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:04,166
Granny!

549
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,444
Watch out, Granny! Granny!

550
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:34,325
Grandma... Grandma, I'd like you to
keep this for me.

551
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:38,401
Grandpa, but it's the Toki family
heirloom sword.

552
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:40,301
The most important thing next to your
life. I can't.

553
00:41:41,204 --> 00:41:44,503
I can't take it with me to heaven.

554
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:47,976
What's wrong, Grandma?

555
00:41:48,812 --> 00:41:57,914
It's the first time you've ever given
me anything.

556
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:17,897
Over here, a little further.

557
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:20,576
Careful!

558
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,274
I found them!

559
00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:32,217
Okay, okay, okay.

560
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:34,189
Slowly, slowly.

561
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:40,123
Carry them out carefully. Careful!

562
00:42:41,064 --> 00:42:42,964
They're hard as rock.

563
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:45,699
Hey, there's one more here!

564
00:42:49,105 --> 00:42:51,835
Good job! Please have some!

565
00:42:59,816 --> 00:43:01,374
Aren't you glad we came, Ayako?

566
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,487
Here you go!

567
00:43:14,063 --> 00:43:15,655
Takeshi left this for you.

568
00:43:16,032 --> 00:43:19,490
He said he couldn't keep Granny's
precious sword.

569
00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:23,972
That fool!

570
00:43:25,675 --> 00:43:28,007
That sentimental fool...

571
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,017
Where's Chimatsuri?

572
00:43:42,926 --> 00:43:45,520
Where's Takeshi, Mom?

573
00:43:46,763 --> 00:43:49,630
Maybe he's with his father.

574
00:43:51,301 --> 00:43:52,768
With Father?

575
00:44:27,503 --> 00:44:31,462
Cry Christmas tonight

576
00:44:32,976 --> 00:44:36,776
Ima kogoesoona heyade

577

579
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:54,493
Cry silence tonight

00:44:56,165 --> 00:45:00,158
Yume o terashiteta light house
