1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:16,600
Aria's heart kept opening and closing for me.

2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,280
She couldn't understand her own feelings.

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,900
However, like the sand falling, our time approached its end.

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,400
Then...

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,580
Yanburikos visited me with no prior contact.

6
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,460
Sorry for the suddenness, but I've brought Jack to you.

7
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:09,350
Naked Eyes - 3

8
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,660
I'm going home then!

9
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,700
What happened Jack?

10
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,920
Give me a ride! I'm going back home.

11
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,080
Don't worry, I'll take care of him somehow.

12
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,440
I'm counting on you, Yanburikos.

13
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,440
I'm counting on you!

14
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,800
Jack, why are you so angry?

15
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,880
It was way too rude!

16
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,060
Why would I recommend that girl?!

17
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,300
Israndia was asked that, too.

18
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,040
I believe it's natural to have me do something to her at least once.

19
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,940
And yet he didn't allow me to even touch her.

20
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,080
Who's asking in such a rude way?

21
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,900
And what that the only issue?

22
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,420
Yanburikos! I've paid a visit to the poor district because you begged me.

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,160
Why did he just give me this?

24
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,220
He just wanted to show her to you.

25
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,820
And you liked that, I guess.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
Am I right?

27
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,500
Of course, it's impossible to get her right away.

28
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,700
I've not touched her yet either.

29
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,320
I want to spread it to confirm how it works.

30
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,620
It works already. Right, Aria?

31
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,400
Yes.

32
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,880
Please, go ahead.

33
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,280
Aria...

34
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,240
Yanburikos.

35
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,600
What?

36
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,040
We can't touch her not because it's the first time.

37
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,880
The reason is because we're the selection committee.

38
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,200
I see. I think I understand now.

39
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,340
Nah, you understand nothing.

40
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,060
If a doctor would brag about his position in the alchemist guild,

41
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,060
it'd be unworthy of the selection committee member.

42
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,280
What should I do now?

43
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,100
I didn't expect them.

44
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,580
Why did they come together?

45
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,740
Master.

46
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,180
What?

47
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,040
Go say it.

48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,700
In order to calm that person down,

49
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,120
let me stay at his house.

50
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,080
You mean, it was a mistake to refuse that Jack do it to you?

51
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,720
Yes. I understand your concern about me,

52
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,600
but what if everything would end like this?

53
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,720
At that moment, I...

54
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,840
I've been beckoning him mentally,

55
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,300
as you taught me, master.

56
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,100
So this is why he's angry.

57
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,240
You did it well. It's not your fault.

58
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,540
But I couldn't see what you did.

59
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,540
Let's go to his house then.

60
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,420
Mr. Jack? Are you going to Duke Charlie?

61
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,160
It's urgent!

62
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,040
What happened?

63
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,520
I need permission to use the soldiers.

64
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,680
Okay, if it's for a butler's service.

65
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,500
But what happened?

66
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,880
Somebody tried to win over the emperor using a dark elf.

67
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,500
Using Clementz to gain info about the experiment?

68
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,780
That's correct.

69
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Perform a bloodless coup d’état, huh?

70
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,460
For our plan to be revealed. What a brazen man.

71
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,020
Okay, crush him!

72
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,520
Okay.

73
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,520
Oh, Aria? Where are you going alone?

74
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,780
This voice...Yanburikos-sama?

75
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,680
Get in, I'll get you there.

76
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,720
I want to visit Jack.

77
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,400
Strangers told me to go this way.

78
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,840
What a coincidence. I'm returning from his house.

79
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,640
But he left his home.

80
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,960
Where?

81
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,220
To the house of Duke Charlie, older brother of the emperor.

82
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,380
Brother of the emperor?

83
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,060
Israndia, you're arrested!

84
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,920
Why?

85
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,180
What is the reason for my arrest?

86
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,920
I don't know. Ask Jack.

87
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,720
Jack's order?

88
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,880
Aria, run!

89
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,560
Shut up!

90
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,200
She has run away already!

91
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,320
Aria? Aria!

92
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,900
Aria noticed the contradiction in her deeds.

93
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,920
She compromised her relationship with Yanburikos to be friends with Jack.

94
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,220
Besides, Yanburikos introduced Jack and Pennel.

95
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,000
What should I do now, master?

96
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,660
It was luck that Aria wasn't arrested.

97
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,820
Where is she?

98
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:36,120
She shouldn't leave the house without my permission.

99
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,340
I was worrying, so she left.

100
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,060
Could it be she ran away from me?

101
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,960
Master!

102
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,760
Yanburikos arrives!

103
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,040
I've brought Yanburikos.

104
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,400
Let him in.

105
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,160
I was surprised by the urgent matter. I've lost one carriage.

106
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,000
Did something happen with the Duke?

107
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,480
It's about Israndia.

108
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,940
I've arrested him.

109
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,220
Israndia? What for?

110
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,780
I believe he wanted a bloodless coup d’état.

111
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,780
Half-elf? Did you mean that Manmade race?

112
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,840
Yes.

113
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,240
But isn't that impossible?

114
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,620
It's a pretext that nobles use to exploit peasants, like the witch hunt.

115
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,220
Watch your mouth!

116
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,740
It's a mansion of Duke Charles, not mine!

117
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,400
Sure. But...

118
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,180
Listen to me, Yanburikos.

119
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,560
There are a lot of people like Israndia who don't fear the God.

120
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,560
Therefore the half-elf race exists for sure.

121
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,680
The problem is we've let the half-elf slip.

122
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
Who are you talking about?

123
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,200
Aria.

124
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,040
You say Aria is a half-elf?

125
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,580
I'm asking, Yanburikos, where did you hide Aria?

126
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,760
Me and Aria? Nonsense.

127
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,400
You've recommended her, too. What is that wound on your forehead?

128
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,020
This is...

129
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,440
That's fine. Wait for the interrogation in the prison.

130
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,100
Are you going to put me and the rest of the selection committee in jail?

131
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,880
I wonder where Aria is now.

132
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,320
And why did Jack arrest me?

133
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,320
Jack, who was supposed to be my ally.

134
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,440
I probably irritated him with my attitude.

135
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,640
The contempt deep in my heart.

136
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:26,020
He must be more powerful than Yamburikos and Pennel.

137
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,920
Or...

138
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,700
What if he wanted to have Aria for himself?

139
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,460
So he imprisoned me.

140
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,020
If so, Jack is a mere butler who needed a good reason

141
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,020
for Duke Charles to enforce the army.

142
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,020
What kind of a reason could it be?

143
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,240
Yanburikos is under arrest too? Why?

144
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,780
Pennel from the selection committee has arrived.

145
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,320
What? Pennel?

146
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
Let her into the reception room.

147
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,640
I'm fine here.

148
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,340
Oh, well.

149
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,380
You're so great to call me without honorifics.

150
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,120
This is, uh...

151
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,900
Don't worry, we're equal committee members.

152
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,020
I'm returning from La Gunse's villa,

153
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,060
but I wanted to discuss something here.

154
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,260
I see, I see. Please, take a seat.

155
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,580
So what exactly did you want to discuss?

156
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,720
An important person for us,  on the selection committee,

157
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,720
disappeared last night.

158
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,520
Also, I want to make an unofficial conference so please summon Yanburikos.

159
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,740
Yanburikos?

160
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,440
His house should be close to this mansion.

161
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,820
He's been imprisoned...

162
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,620
in this castle.

163
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,020
That's great! Let's start the conference, then.

164
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,160
I don't mind doing it here.

165
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,960
What kind of a conference?

166
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,460
Also, who is that person?

167
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,780
Y-you!

168
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,480
Yanburikos! You're going to go to the conference! You're free for a while.

169
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,720
A conference? What kind?

170
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,560
I thought it's an interrogation.

171
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,940
Well, doesn't matter if I can get out of here.

172
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,520
Okay, now Yanburikos knows I'm here.

173
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,140
Albert?

174
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,380
Albert, is it you?

175
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,080
Is Nigredo with you?

176
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,540
I see.

177
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,740
Help me.

178
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,960
So, Israndia is in the underground prison.

179
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,620
Yanburikos was in jail until now, too. Is that correct?

180
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,780
Yes, correct. Right, Jack?

181
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,200
Jack, give us an explanation.

182
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,480
This woman is a half-elf.

183
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,020
So I have to arrest him as her creator.

184
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,820
Half-elf? Wait, how can you conclude Aria is a half-elf?

185
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,040
Here is a love perfume that Israndia made.

186
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,340
I got the perfume I liked.

187
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,360
I understood it once I smelled it.

188
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,780
The symptoms of its effect were on Aria's body.

189
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,720
Her skin flushed and got goosebumps.

190
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,140
However, I noticed something.

191
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:40,340
Her clitoris enlarged and she was very excited.

192
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,600
I see. The smell was the same?

193
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,020
The smell?!

194
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,960
A woman's smell changes when she is aroused.

195
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,760
Aria shed drops of her love juices, but the smell was nice!

196
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,000
Israndia knew this and hid from me!

197
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
That's why he stopped me.

198
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,540
Oh, I didn't notice this.

199
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,360
Now I get it.

200
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,880
Israndia couldn't let us touch Aria.

201
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,280
Probably because I was the only one who noticed it.

202
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,240
Are those all your reasons?

203
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,700
One more reason.

204
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,400
There was a cat-like animal in his room.

205
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,340
But not real cats. Surprisingly it was the two of them!

206
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,160
They were alike as if God created them! He must have made them.

207
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,160
This proves that Israndia possesses skills; the magic to produce half-elves!

208
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,300
I'm sure of it.

209
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,440
That's true, two identical animals is a strange fact.

210
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,600
So that's why she is so strong!

211
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,980
Oh, shut up.

212
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,060
Aria told me what you planned to do last night.

213
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,680
What did you do, Yanburikos? Could it be you with Aria?

214
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,560
No, that's...

215
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,140
Hey, Jack! Listen to me.

216
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,040
Release Israndia immediately.

217
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,680
I'll take care of him along with Aria.

218
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,600
As if I can do it!

219
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,200
I'll arrest Aria after the conference!

220
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,180
Also, what is Aria doing here? She isn't allowed!

221
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,740
Are you saying you're allowed to capture Israndia and Aria?

222
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,240
It's natural to arrest a half-elf and its creator.

223
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Shut up! I'm not your blind slave! It must be your will,

224
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,080
or Duke Charles's will!

225
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:55,800
You won't go unpunished even if it's an emperor's brother's desire!

226
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,220
Why?

227
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,840
That would mean mutiny against the emperor.

228
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,800
Mutiny?

229
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,820
But why?

230
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,440
Your face says I'm right.

231
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,640
No, that's my sole will,

232
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,980
and the Duke is unrelated.

233
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,840
Uh, your will?

234
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:27,040
So why did you want to arrest both of them?

235
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,440
I want Aria.

236
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,640
Did you want to fuck Aria?

237
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,760
Yes.

238
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,580
Can you make a statement that you won't cover for Duke Charlie?

239
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,340
Of course!

240
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,400
Then, do Aria.

241
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,780
Are you letting him have Aria?

242
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,860
Only once, and here.

243
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,140
Don't you mind, Aria?

244
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,400
Sure.

245
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,900
Also, you'll recommend Aria as a committee member and give me Israndia and Aria.

246
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,960
No, that's...

247
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,900
Why are you so hesitant? Could it be that

248
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,900
you're covering for Duke Charlie?

249
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,900
Not at all!

250
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,260
Jack wanted to do it to Aria. Right?

251
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,520
Go ahead, Jack.

252
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,680
Forgive me, master!

253
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,200
Everything is for your benefit.

254
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,520
This is the first time with another man.

255
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,680
What's happened? Go on.

256
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,480
No end to this in sight?

257
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,040
I've seen something I shouldn't!

258
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,480
So you're unable to!

259
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,340
This makes no explanation of your motive.

260
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,280
So it was an order from Duke Charlie after all.

261
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,160
No, I have a male's sexual desire.

262
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,260
I see. But you can't do anything with your thing?

263
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,700
I can.

264
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,640
How?

265
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,680
I smell the scent of an aroused woman.

266
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,400
So that's why your nose so sensitive.

267
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,320
But Aria...

268
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,500
Yes, her scent doesn't change even if she's aroused.

269
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,780
Even if Aria lures you...

270
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,440
I can do nothing.

271
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,540
Such a pity. I'd do everything imaginable with Aria.

272
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,780
We have a problem.

273
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,940
You're saying you see Aria as being nothing but a doll.

274
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,320
I feel much more than strongly than that.

275
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,720
If I can't see your ejaculation, I can't decide whether you are aroused or not.

276
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,820
I can say that your body didn't ever have true desire.

277
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,320
Are you saying I've tricked you?

278
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,700
Your words that you want fuck Aria can't be explained otherwise.

279
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,560
I don't know what to say.

280
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,260
I have an idea if the problem is the smell alone.

281
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,640
What is it?

282
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,700
At that time, I had escaped from the prison and was wandering in the labyrinth.

283
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,260
The underground duct.

284
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,660
What a smell.

285
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:19,420
Yanburikos's idea was to get Aria aroused without this perfume.

286
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,080
But you just wanted to entertain yourself

287
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,080
by watching how he was going to try to do that?

288
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,720
What is it, Yanburikos?

289
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,760
This is the first time I'm doing it, and your gaze is...

290
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,580
Aria!

291
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,620
Aria, Aria!

292
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,540
A seductress...She is a seductress!

293
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,220
Yanburikos.

294
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,420
What?

295
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,940
Make Aria come now.

296
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,000
Okay!

297
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,580
This smell is the problem.

298
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,320
What a scary woman.

299
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,860
I lose no matter if I cum or not.

300
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,840
Yanburikos, you're free to do whatever you want.

301
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,340
Are you sure? Then...

302
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,500
Smell it while watching those two.

303
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,640
I'm entering.

304
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,760
What a pitiful look.

305
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,420
Jack, if you don't cum, you'll lose.

306
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,880
Not to mention you demonstrated that shame to us.

307
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,360
Jack...It seems you've ejaculated.

308
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,500
If I didn't come, it would have proved that it wasn't my intent,
and if I did, it proved Aria is not a half-elf.

309
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,600
Pennel has won completely.

310
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,000
But Aria should be a half-elf.

311
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,960
It must be Pennel's filthy smell that made me come.

312
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:42,060
It's as if I've been seduced by the tricky Pennel.

313
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,760
Israndia has escaped.

314
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,180
Master.

315
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,940
What is it, Jack? Are you saying you let him escape?

316
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,060
Give Israndia to me!

317
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,800
The End
