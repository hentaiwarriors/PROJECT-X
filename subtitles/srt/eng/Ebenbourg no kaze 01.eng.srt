1
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,028
Wind of Ebenbourg

2
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:59,935
Chapter 1: Land of Passion

3
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:11,873
Come in.

4
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,825
About your dinner.

5
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:22,828
Could you bring it here?

6
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:23,885
Very well.

7
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:29,835
I believe that it will ready in a short while.

8
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:34,840
Monsieur McDonald, you ordered
the beef dinner, correct?

9
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:35,840
Yes.

10
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,844
You are in for a treat, Monsieur McDonald.

11
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:42,848
Tonight's beef dinner is wiener schnitzel.

12
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,851
We're proud to say
that it is our train's specialty.

13
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:46,851
It's delicious.

14
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,854
I'm looking forward to it.

15
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:50,545
Coming right up.

16
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:59,455
This luxurious trip
is all thanks to Sophie.

17
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:06,739
The Grand Duchy of Ebenbourg?

18
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:10,068
My name is Sophie Delmotte.

19
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:12,878
Were you writing a letter?

20
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:14,937
It's a side job.

21
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:18,079
I write letters for others.
I really enjoy it.

22
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:21,885
You are studying commerce right now?

23
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:25,891
Yes. My dream is to travel
the world as a great merchant.

24
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:30,789
It may be a bit exaggerated.

25
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:41,564
Bernard...

26
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:51,546
Come to Ebenbourg, where your late
father used to live.

27
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:06,132
Why are you doing this?

28
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,524
Don't ask a thing.

29
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:04,587
I'm sorry. It's my first time.

30
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:09,051
It's my first time too.

31
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:47,089
Be gentle.

32
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,798
Does it hurt? Are you okay?

33
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:39,642
I'm fine. I want to know.
Does it feel good?

34
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:44,149
Yes. It's wonderful, Miss Delmotte.

35
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,151
Call me Sophie.

36
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:49,711
I will. Is it okay for me to move, Sophie?

37
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:45,176
Ever since my mother died,
I've worked at many stores.

38
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:48,673
It was more useful than class.

39
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:54,219
So it served you multiple purposes?

40
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,219
Yes.

41
00:07:56,322 --> 00:08:00,224
So, why are you asking me
to ride such a splendid train?

42
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:03,228
I will be frank and straight to the point.

43
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:07,230
You're real name is Claude Flavini.

44
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:14,039
I'm to meet you as the Lord of Ronsard,
a town in the Grand Duchy of Ebenbourg.

45
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:28,414
What did you want?

46
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,782
Put this in his food?

47
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:46,202
Allow me to carry them.

48
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:50,270
My, sorry to interrupt your conversation.

49
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:52,334
No, I've already finished.

50
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:55,337
Remember my words.

51
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,285
Where is my seat?

52
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,344
I'll show you right away.

53
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,987
Are you fine with sharing a room?

54
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:11,856
I can find you another private room.

55
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:16,535
It's okay. My granddaughter took extra care
in reserving a shared room...

56
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,102
because she thought it was dangerous
for me to travel alone.

57
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:25,200
I understand.
In that case, please follow me.

58
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,839
Come in.

59
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:36,246
Excuse me. She's sharing the room.

60
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:40,188
Nice to meet you.

61
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:45,387
My, you are quite young.
It is a pleasure to meet you.

62
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:59,669
Your main dish, Madame Delmotte,
is flounder from the Straits of Dover.

63
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:02,904
My, it looks delicious!

64
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:14,682
Monsieur McDonald ordered
the wiener schnitzel.

65
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:21,957
There you go, enjoy.

66
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:28,071
I'm sorry, but could you
pass me the water?

67
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,530
Yes.

68
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:38,042
My! How clumsy of me.

69
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:41,186
It's okay, I'll clean it up.
You don't have to worry.

70
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:46,448
I'm sorry. Please, have my dinner.
Won't you?

71
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:00,361
Your dinner?

72
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:02,004
Are you sure about that?

73
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:03,297
Yes.

74
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:17,183
I put the sleeping drug in.
That Madame accidentally...

75
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:07,996
Just as Sophie said,
he looks like his father, Bernard Flavini.

76
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,468
He's a very handsome young man.

77
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:16,379
Maybe he will be able to revive Ronsard
and bring new wind to Ebenbourg.

78
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:39,097
Ronsard. Was it this desolate before?

79
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,097
Someone! Stop me now!

80
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:22,047
I order everyone to save me!

81
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:31,188
Mistress Rosalie!

82
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:32,649
Mistress Rosalie, please be careful!

83
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,586
What happened? Did someone get hurt?

84
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,588
What's with all this ruckus?

85
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:04,918
An accident?

86
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:06,547
Look at all the smoke.

87
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,651
It's still in the morning.

88
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:15,657
What's going on? I'm trying to...

89
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:19,960
Grab hold.

90
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:25,467
I don't know what you were
doing in this cold weather.

91
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:27,044
Here.

92
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:30,805
Just a whore.

93
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:34,348
Back you go.

94
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,685
What is your name? Tell me.

95
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:46,054
Claude McDonald.

96
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,634
How courageous.

97
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:52,694
I appreciate it that you didn't
hold me too tightly.

98
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,440
All right, I've made up my mind.

99
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:58,567
Claude, you are to marry right away.

100
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,710
Mistress Rosalie!

101
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:15,717
Worry not, I am unharmed!
This man here...

102
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:20,194
Mistress Rosalie,
please don't be so naïve.

103
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:21,956
Let us handle the driving.

104
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:24,268
Now, come with us.

105
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:30,565
Claude McDonald, I shall wait
for our fateful reunion!

106
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:46,248
It's already past the scheduled time.

107
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:50,929
Did I get lost?

108
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:55,594
That's odd, I don't see the convent
I'm supposed to pass.

109
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:06,768
Excuse me, sir!

110
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,986
I wonder if he didn't notice me.

111
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:21,449
There it is. The convent
I'm supposed to pass!

112
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:39,567
Please, become the new
wind of Ebenbourg.

113
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:15,836
There it is!

114
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:40,696
I have been waiting for you,
Claude McDonald.

115
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:44,808
Allow me.

116
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,811
No, I'll carry it.

117
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,813
It is my duty.

118
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:51,941
Please watch your step.
The floor is slippery right now.

119
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,815
What's your name?

120
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:02,094
Pardon me.

121
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:05,822
I am Mylene Trantoul,
I am the maid of this mansion.

122
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:10,892
Well, nice to meet you.

123
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:23,104
What a wonderful bath.

124
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:26,275
I'm relaxed.

125
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:51,933
Lord Eric!

126
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:54,936
Mylene.

127
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:18,631
This beautiful scenery, hot springs,
it has appeal as a tourist attraction.

128
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:20,739
Road maintenance
and establishing enough lodgings...

129
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:22,974
are the first things I need to do.

130
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:25,841
It's not like it's been decided...

131
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:28,240
that I'm going to be the lord
of this desolate region.

132
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:35,318
But I want to live
up to Sophie's expectations.

133
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:38,320
It's my first time too.

134
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,103
Blood's starting to rush
to my head I'd better get out.

135
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:01,435
Mylene!

136
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:06,276
You mustn't, Lord Eric.

137
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,010
You mustn't, Lord Eric!

138
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:12,718
Why did you come back?

139
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:16,188
I want one more chance.

140
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:19,860
You don't mean become
the Lord of Ronsard again?

141
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:21,765
That's right. And then...

142
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:23,663
Ebenbourg will be mine!

143
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:27,972
At this rate, Ebenbourg will be seized
by a more powerful country.

144
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,974
Before that happens!

145
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:32,977
You mustn't, someone's here.

146
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:35,980
Plus Mistress Delmotte will soon arrive.

147
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:36,980
Sophie Delmotte!

148
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,984
The wretch who sold me out?

149
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:42,043
Miss Trantoul!

150
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:44,055
Mylene?

151
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,552
This isn't it. Where was the room
I'm supposed to be staying in?

152
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:05,036
Mylene, do you know where my clothes are?

153
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:09,904
They were wet,
so I moved them by the fireplace.

154
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:13,074
You were changing? I apologize!

155
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:20,251
- Master!
- I heard a sound.

156
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,056
It's a rat or a fox, maybe a wolf.

157
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,901
Is that why you wanted me?

158
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:34,698
No, that's not it. It's a mistake.

159
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:47,850
Do your bidding, Master.

160
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:16,137
Master, lower.

161
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:18,772
Okay.

162
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:35,827
It hurts, Master, please be more gentle.

163
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:37,925
Sorry.

164
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:54,175
Lord Eric!

165
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:56,410
Yes!

166
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:00,675
Lord Eric!

167
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:30,932
It seems that you've failed.

168
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:36,280
He got lucky.

169
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:40,944
I've been ordered to help you
from now on, but not directly anymore.

170
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:44,416
It's up to you whether or not you make
a comeback as the lord.

171
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:48,753
Eric Flavini.

172
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:51,352
Yeah, I'll do my best.

173
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:08,075
To be continued
