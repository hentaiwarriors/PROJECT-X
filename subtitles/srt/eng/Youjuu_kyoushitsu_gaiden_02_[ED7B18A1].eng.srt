1
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:58,671
This is the night circuit where
Miki last disappeared, but...

2
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:03,710
We've seen generally what
her riding patterns are.

3
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:06,085
She wouldn't take a route
she's already taken before.

4
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:08,387
Yeah. Just like Sis wouldn't.

5
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,618
But, if she really is Sis...

6
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:11,786
then she'll have to
pass by this toll plaza.

7
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:32,003
Sis!

8
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:33,413
Sis!

9
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:38,748
Sis!

10
00:01:40,257 --> 00:01:41,747
Weirder than usual.

11
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:46,426
Wait!

12
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:52,463
Stop, please!

13
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:07,608
What the...

14
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,859
What was that?

15
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:24,330
- Ash...
- That was our sister.

16
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,132
Huh?

17
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:30,634
Don't you think you look
a lot like her, Miki?

18
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,041
I don't have any sisters.

19
00:02:33,276 --> 00:02:37,975
We were more than sisters.
We three were once a team.

20
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:40,349
Are you pulling my leg?

21
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:43,815
No, but explaining would
take a long time.

22
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:46,453
We need your power now!

23
00:02:50,393 --> 00:02:54,329
You aren't like those girls who usually
follow me around. Come on!

24
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:15,177
Drink.

25
00:03:24,794 --> 00:03:26,091
What's with you?

26
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:28,460
I was thinking about Sis.

27
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:31,266
I don't think we ever saw her smile.

28
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:39,166
Now, how about that explanation?

29
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:40,709
Where's Mari and the rest?

30
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:43,337
They still aren't back
from picking up Emi.

31
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:52,847
Mari?

32
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:57,119
Mari? Guys?
What are you doing?

33
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:57,785
Mother! Mother!

34
00:04:57,854 --> 00:05:01,620
Where are you?
Where is my Mother?

35
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,293
Kayo! Where are you going?

36
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:10,958
I'm here with you, Kayo! Kayo!

37
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:14,399
It's me! Don't you recognize me, Kayo?

38
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:21,640
Is the Demon Beast calling her again?

39
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,971
Kayo...

40
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:30,786
That's a pretty unbelievable story.

41
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:34,516
But when I look into your eyes,
I can see you're not lying to me.

42
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,649
Miki!

43
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:40,092
Can you show me the image of
the Ash you remember again?

44
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,902
She does look like me.

45
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,944
Do you remember what her
final moments were like?

46
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:57,368
Miki!

47
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,176
I want to see how she died.

48
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,647
Not so bad. She went beyond
the wind and became light.

49
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,652
I don't think I'll live another year.

50
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:44,988
Miki!

51
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:47,560
I don't really have any ties
to life anymore.

52
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,657
Only when I'm riding my machine and
become like the wind do I feel truly alive.

53
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:52,825
Miki...

54
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:55,871
My parents died when they were flying
to Mexico to see my big brother race...

55
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:58,703
when a supersonic test jet
collided with their plane.

56
00:07:00,677 --> 00:07:03,612
I hated the jet that killed them.

57
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,241
But I love speed
as much as my brother did.

58
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,083
Only in that instant when I feel like
the wind itself do I feel happiness.

59
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:13,122
Like I'm with them again.

60
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:14,816
But now...

61
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:20,362
Now I only live in my memories.

62
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,764
My body may be alive,
but my heart died a long time ago!

63
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:29,037
You chose a good moment
to show up, BB, Dee.

64
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,196
You mean...

65
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:34,937
I've been dreaming about a blazing end
for this life of mine.

66
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:37,669
I'd like to die by becoming light.

67
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:39,977
So I guess I'd be glad to
become your sister.

68
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:40,913
Miki!

69
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:42,448
Thank you.

70
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,382
BB here.

71
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:47,855
This is Muneto!
The Demon Beast's appeared!

72
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:50,552
And Kayo's getting even worse.
Get back here, please!

73
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:51,958
Roger!

74
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:20,345
Demon Beast carriers!

75
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:36,269
Miki!

76
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:48,544
None of you will get
even one step past me!

77
00:09:08,271 --> 00:09:10,501
That's the Demon Beast?

78
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:15,201
Mother-r-r-r-r-r!

79
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:23,045
BB! Where's Dee?

80
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,186
She's fighting Demon Beast carriers.

81
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:30,318
Ash... No, Cat's Eye...

82
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:33,055
I am Ash. I feel that I am.

83
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:37,496
When I heard about Ash and you,
I got a strange feeling inside.

84
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:41,397
Help us, Muneto! Our ship's in
that grove of trees out back.

85
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:43,302
Gotcha!

86
00:09:52,282 --> 00:09:54,341
Miki, are you sure about this?

87
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:56,449
Don't make me start
having second thoughts.

88
00:09:56,953 --> 00:09:59,717
I'm not into self-sacrifice.

89
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:02,956
I chose to become Ash so that I can live!

90
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:09,693
You can ask BB and Dee about it later.

91
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,431
Miki, undress and get in.

92
00:10:12,802 --> 00:10:13,666
I'd better go.

93
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:20,933
Stay here! You have to be here
when Ash revives.

94
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:22,600
Miki...

95
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:25,908
Ash loved only one man.

96
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:29,042
When she revives, the first
thing she should see is you.

97
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,597
All set over here!

98
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:52,539
It's Dee!

99
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:55,133
They're chasing her!
Muneto, take care of this!

100
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:58,811
Miki... Thank you.

101
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:07,618
Thank you. For being the first
and last man I'll ever love.

102
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:09,680
Miki...

103
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:24,962
Dee!

104
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:30,605
- Where's Miki?
- In the capsule.

105
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,017
Ash... Come back to us.

106
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,649
Ash. Do you hear me?

107
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:10,880
You are the greatest warrior
the I MOA ever produced.

108
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:14,823
Ash, we need your
powers once more.

109
00:12:26,602 --> 00:12:28,229
Oh, God, no! Rejection?

110
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:34,069
Miki!

111
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,076
They're both dying!

112
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:46,616
Big brother!

113
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:02,368
Ash, warrior above all others.

114
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:06,431
Awaken! Your power
is needed! Ash!

115
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:25,124
Ash!

116
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:45,708
Ash...

117
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:51,079
Ash? Why? Why aren't you moving?

118
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:02,254
Ash? What's wrong? Ash!

119
00:14:06,702 --> 00:14:09,728
Mune... to... Help me...

120
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:11,699
Ash?

121
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:16,067
Show me joy, like when we first met.

122
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:20,445
When you and Kayo become one...

123
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:22,575
The power of Maitreya can...

124
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:27,984
Ash!

125
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:50,639
Muneto!

126
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:52,239
Ash...

127
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:54,281
To the heights of ecstasy...

128
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,578
Ash!

129
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:13,766
Muneto!

130
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:17,232
Ash...

131
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:40,756
Muneto!

132
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:44,260
Muneto!

133
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:46,924
Mother!

134
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:32,170
Muneto!

135
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:33,613
Muneto...

136
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:57,002
Muneto!

137
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:26,861
Muneto!

138
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:51,819
Dee...

139
00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:54,357
Sis...

140
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:57,296
We won. All the carriers are dead.

141
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,928
What about Miki?

142
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:09,638
Mu... Muneto...

143
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:21,253
Sis!

144
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:23,448
BB! Dee!

145
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:24,882
Sis...

146
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,291
Where's the Demon Beast?

147
00:18:33,302 --> 00:18:35,361
She slept through it, totally oblivious.

148
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:39,631
That's for the best. All she needs
to see when she awakens is you.

149
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,642
Ash...

150
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,974
Sis! The Demon Beast!
We've looked everywhere...

151
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:46,071
but it's just disappeared.

152
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:51,810
Don't worry. It'll come back here, attracted
by the scent of Kayo's pheromones.

153
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:54,050
He'll have to show.

154
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:57,689
Move out!

155
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,624
Ash!

156
00:18:59,195 --> 00:19:02,528
Muneto, I'll never forget you.

157
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:03,997
Take care of Kayo.

158
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:14,633
All citizens in the area, please
evacuate in an orderly fashion.

159
00:19:19,415 --> 00:19:23,146
Mother. Mother, where are you?

160
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:36,689
It entered onto this course
when you began to revive.

161
00:19:36,765 --> 00:19:39,825
Ash, I'm glad you're back.
How do you feel?

162
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:50,504
The terminals in your helmet are
set to tap into your body's powers.

163
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:53,480
In the event you have to initiate
your Final Mission option...

164
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:56,382
the armor you're wearing will
automatically merge with your body.

165
00:19:56,452 --> 00:20:00,479
The armor is also equipped to give
off pheromones identical to Kayo's.

166
00:20:00,556 --> 00:20:02,387
It should be enough to
confuse the Demon Beast.

167
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:09,523
When he's overwhelmed with desire,
you'll have your best chance.

168
00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:12,861
Failure is not an option. Good luck.

169
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:27,546
Mother! Mother's scent!
A scent so thick it chokes me!

170
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:35,546
I can't stand it! Where is she?
Mother, where are you?

171
00:20:48,938 --> 00:20:50,462
Mother?

172
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:54,941
No, not Mother. But the scent!

173
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:58,240
The scent drives me mad!

174
00:20:58,314 --> 00:21:02,580
It has to be her!
The smell of Mother's warm juices!

175
00:21:06,822 --> 00:21:08,255
Who are you?

176
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:38,251
Ash!

177
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:40,515
Sis!

178
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:43,023
Dee, no! You'll only get in her way!

179
00:21:43,993 --> 00:21:44,982
Sis...

180
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:56,970
Where is she?
Where have you taken Mother?

181
00:21:58,941 --> 00:22:01,307
Where is my Mother?

182
00:22:12,988 --> 00:22:16,856
This scent... This scent...
Is it not Mother's?

183
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:23,659
Yes, this. Is this warmth
I feel not Mother's warmth?

184
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:32,399
I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore!

185
00:22:32,474 --> 00:22:35,602
Mother! Become one with me!

186
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:40,410
Give me your power for all time!
Give me the energy of your joy!

187
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:41,843
Sis!

188
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:43,241
Ash!

189
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,349
Miki!

190
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:51,984
Miki!

191
00:22:56,665 --> 00:22:59,566
Beyond the wind...
To become light itself!

192
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:08,236
Become one with me!

193
00:23:08,577 --> 00:23:11,045
Become one with me!

194
00:23:16,952 --> 00:23:18,442
I've won.

195
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,123
Ash...

196
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:43,939
Mother...

197
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:51,246
Oh, the heights of ecstasy!

198
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:08,426
MOTHER!

199
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:18,178
Sis!

200
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:19,578
Miki!

201
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:21,775
ASH!

202
00:24:34,963 --> 00:24:36,123
Sis...

203
00:24:36,765 --> 00:24:38,130
Miki...

204
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:43,563
Ash...

205
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:06,093
BB and Dee have returned.

206
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:07,150
Captain O...

207
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:09,220
Mission accomplished.

208
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:12,823
Eternal glory to Ash and Miki.

209
00:25:21,276 --> 00:25:25,235
So, it all ended while I was sound asleep?

210
00:25:25,647 --> 00:25:28,514
It's better that way.
I'll always be at your side.

211
00:25:30,852 --> 00:25:31,978
Mm...

212
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:35,248
Ash. I don't believe you're dead.

213
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,620
I think I may see you again,
someday. And you, too, Miki.

214
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,329

I may not have known your name

215

Maybe it's that feeling of calm
