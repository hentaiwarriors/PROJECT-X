1
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:28,225
<i>After racing</i>
<i>through a cheerful season...</i>

2
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,060
<i>...what will happen to the</i>
<i>footprints in the sand of my memory?</i>

3
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:42,166
<i>Tears are rolling down</i>
<i>to the beach of my heart...</i>

4
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:48,343
<i>Wind wipes them away.</i>

5
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:55,913
<i>The sky is reflected in my heart.</i>

6
00:00:56,721 --> 00:01:03,251
<i>You always change like a whirlwind.</i>

7
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:08,625
Why don't you come over
to my apartment at midnight?

8
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:10,525
Both of you.

9
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:17,875
Saki...

10
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:32,319
<i>Kindness pushes back clouds...</i>

11
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:35,654
<i>But rain like tears falls from them.</i>

12
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,126
<i>Sometimes, indigo girl...</i>

13
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:47,464
<i>...sadness is just like a</i>
<i>quick rain before you grow up.</i>

14
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,802
<i>Start to run, now...</i>

15
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:53,740
<i>Dream in the future.</i>

16
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:38,545
Let's finish the fight
that started three years ago.

17
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:43,221
I wonder what happened between them.

18
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:45,025
Kaori...

19
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,721
Yes.

20
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:49,231
Sorry I got you into trouble.

21
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,027
It's okay.

22
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:58,442
Well...

23
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:00,609
Here we are.

24
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,947
This is Saki's apartment.

25
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:25,829
It's open.

26
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,203
Come in, Kaoru.

27
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,612
Like I said, I'm using
my real name, Yuko Imai.

28
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:47,956
You're so punctual...

29
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,091
...as always.

30
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:52,920
Don't be shy, come in.

31
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,868
This room looks the
same as it did three years ago.

32
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:10,141
Unbelievable. She always...

33
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:11,780
What happened?

34
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:13,875
Nothing...

35
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:15,477
All right.

36
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:20,255
Let's start the game right now.

37
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:23,955
If you win, I keep your secret.

38
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:28,063
But if we win, I will take Kaori.

39
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:29,899
We?

40
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:35,332
The game won't be interesting if it's
just between you and me, Big Sister.

41
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:37,875
Because we have a pretty guest...

42
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,541
I added a special twist.

43
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,008
Sayaka.

44
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:46,514
Yes, Big Sister.

45
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:00,830
Ms. Tamura, Saki definitely...

46
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:02,926
Do you know her?

47
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,466
She is Sayaka Tamura and she
debuted in the same year you did!

48
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,303
Ouch!

49
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:15,938
You two competed for the
Best New Singer Award, remember?

50
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:18,411
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:20,245
You guys lost the mood.

52
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:21,375
Anyway...

53
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:22,111
Oh!

54
00:05:23,254 --> 00:05:25,188
She is one of my collection.

55
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:27,051
My cute pet.

56
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,223
How's this?

57
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:36,059
We will swap partners and if
you make her come first, you win.

58
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:37,060
What?

59
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:39,030
What? That could be fun.

60
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:41,196
Moron.

61
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,200
This is a problem between you and me.

62
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:46,639
It's not good to get them involved.

63
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:48,145
Kaoru.

64
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:51,244
You have no choice.

65
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,451
Yuko.

66
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:57,415
Ms. Saki!

67
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,220
I will do it.

68
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:01,982
No, Kaori.

69
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,518
Don't worry.

70
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:05,425
I will protect you.

71
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:12,197
I want to help you.

72
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:14,169
Kaori...

73
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:15,734
Sayaka...

74
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:20,634
She's a good girl.

75
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:24,308
Needless to say...

76
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:27,512
...it's lots of fun to
make such a pretty girl come.

77
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:40,831
That's right.

78
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,194
Feel it.

79
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:57,440
You are already hard enough...

80
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:00,484
No...

81
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,463
Such a cute voice.

82
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:55,296
What happened?

83
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:57,432
Is that it?

84
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,446
You're no match for me.

85
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:10,185
No.

86
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,580
I won't lose.

87
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:17,361
I don't know what
happened three years ago.

88
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,053
But, I trust Yuko.

89
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,262
Trust...

90
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,189
Can you trust Yuko?

91
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:24,933
Yes, I can.

92
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:34,975
What the hell do you know?

93
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,972
Three years ago...

94
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:44,913
Yuko disappeared
without saying a word.

95
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,817
She said she loved me.

96
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,986
She said she would be my side.

97
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,122
She betrayed me!

98
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:57,696
I have waited for her.

99
00:08:57,902 --> 00:09:00,200
But she picked you up.

100
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:01,736
Ms. Saki...

101
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:04,334
How can you trust her?

102
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,075
Saki...

103
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:11,273
Shit.

104
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:12,678
I have to...

105
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:30,156
Seems like she is enjoying it...

106
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:34,261
But her reaction is so-so...

107
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,219
I have to, otherwise...

108
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:51,549
I will lose.

109
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:57,256
What?

110
00:09:58,629 --> 00:09:59,527
You're kidding me!

111
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:07,401
As I guessed, Saki
trained you to enjoy anal sex.

112
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:09,229
In that case...

113
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:12,531
No...

114
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:17,175
I will go wild for a while.

115
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,533
Looks like you found out.

116
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:39,497
But...

117
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:41,460
It's too late.

118
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:42,671
I will win.

119
00:10:58,789 --> 00:10:59,983
Okay, Kaori.

120
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,018
I will make you come inside me soon.

121
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:36,648
I have to win.

122
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:15,189
Are you coming?

123
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,627
You want to come, right?

124
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:22,029
I'm coming.

125
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:24,198
Please, hurry up.

126
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:27,473
I won!

127
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:28,370
Kaori!

128
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:29,470
What!

129
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:41,055
Sayaka.

130
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:08,583
Yuko.

131
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:12,545
Saki, you are the one
who taught her about it.

132
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:15,624
And I am the one
who taught you about it.

133
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:18,156
It was easy to figure out her fetish.

134
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:22,158
That means I lost.

135
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:25,926
Saki, listen.

136
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:30,232
I feel bad that I disappeared three
years ago without saying anything.

137
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,064
But...

138
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:34,709
Saki...

139
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,849
You think I didn't know anything?

140
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:42,350
I knew what happened three years ago.

141
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:43,985
Why?

142
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:45,713
What I can't forgive is...

143
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:48,213
Yuko.

144
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:52,958
You feel jealous of Kaori.

145
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:55,791
That's why you challenged us to this...

146
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:58,460
Don't flatter yourself.

147
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:07,808
Why should I feel jealous of
the girl you abandoned me for?

148
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:11,308
Saki...

149
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:16,183
I played the game just
because I wanted Kaori.

150
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,985
The game is over.

151
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:20,817
I'll keep her secret.

152
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:21,947
Go.

153
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:23,323
Ms. Saki...

154
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:25,154
I'm sorry, Saki.

155
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:27,088
But trust me.

156
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:30,467
It wasn't that I didn't like you.

157
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:31,795
Go away right now.

158
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:39,739
Saki.

159
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:50,949
Idiot...

160
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:13,234
Four years ago...

161
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:16,375
Saki and I debuted in the same year.

162
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,711
We competed against each other for
most of the Best New Singer awards.

163
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:26,414
We were very good rivals.

164
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:36,194
But, once we left the stage, we had
to deal with a lot of different people.

165
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:37,731
Yuko...

166
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:56,209
It's locked.

167
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:58,815
You've gotta be kidding.

168
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:02,125
Boss! Open the door!

169
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,290
I know you're there.

170
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:07,896
Please open. Can you hear me?

171
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:11,798
Open! Boss! Boss!

172
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,667
Please open!

173
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:18,837
Why?

174
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,706
Why?

175
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:26,273
Don't come near me!

176
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:27,979
Liar!

177
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:30,150
You told me we were
going to just drink together.

178
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:32,782
Why are you giving me trouble?

179
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:36,359
Your agency
already said this was okay.

180
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:39,924
You've gotta be kidding me.

181
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:45,901
When I said it is necessary
for you, they gladly said okay.

182
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,035
Unbelievable...

183
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:55,100
We will give you a lot of opportunities.

184
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:57,846
Of course, it's not free.

185
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:02,615
You should decide.

186
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,017
You want to sing as
a star in the spot light...

187
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,819
...or return to being a regular woman?

188
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:14,091
How can I...

189
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:19,960
Looks like you understand.

190
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:27,302
No...

191
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:30,009
Let's start!

192
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:45,250
Here...

193
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,563
Don't be selfish.

194
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:31,834
No! Please stop!

195
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,676
Here, keep using your mouth.

196
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:13,044
I'm coming!

197
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:23,887
No!

198
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:28,723
What's that?

199
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,733
You're giving up already?

200
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:36,335
I wonder if you can survive in
this tough entertainment business.

201
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,449
Next is...

202
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:55,621
No, let me go!

203
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:57,855
What are you talking about?

204
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:00,222
Your friend just showed up.

205
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:03,596
Why don't you play together?

206
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:04,597
No!

207
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:07,268
Saki...

208
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,007
Are you okay?

209
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:21,610
That wasn't so bad, was it?

210
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:27,985
Let's go Saki!

211
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,316
Yes...

212
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:31,418
Wait.

213
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:33,489
It's your job.

214
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,824
You have no choice.

215
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:45,400
I'll get over it...

216
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:47,741
I'll get over it...

217
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,072
I can't stand it any more.

218
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:57,316
I became a singer
because I want to sing.

219
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:00,114
Why do I have to do these things?

220
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,822
This isn't the
reason I became a singer...

221
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:05,756
Saki...

222
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,962
I will quit sing--

223
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,530
Don't say any more.

224
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:14,502
But I can't handle it...

225
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,705
You don't suddenly
dislike singing, do you?

226
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:21,705
I like to sing, too.

227
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:25,944
I am sure that there are
people who are waiting for my songs.

228
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:29,247
If I believe that, I can keep singing.

229
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:30,981
No matter what...

230
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:35,889
Let's be together.

231
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:37,851
Kaoru.

232
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,124
I will be always on your side.

233
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:50,199
But, one year later I got...

234
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:53,573
...an infection...

235
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:55,809
...damaging my vocal cords.

236
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:04,250
I didn't want her to notice
that I couldn't sing any more.

237
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:08,191
Because I liked her, I really liked her.

238
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,550
I didn't want to be seen as
such a miserable figure by her.

239
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:14,830
So, I disappeared silently.

240
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:17,864
But, I didn't imagine I hurt her so much.

241
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:24,001
Yuko, I think she
definitely understands your feelings.

242
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:29,903
How bitter and sad you were...

243
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:35,782
...she definitely understands.

244
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:43,858
I am sorry, I made you feel bad.

245
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:47,424
That's not true.

246
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:49,090
Because...

247
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,130
My life has been
better since I met Yuko.

248
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:04,380
Good morning.

249
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:05,311
Good morning.

250
00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:06,140
What?

251
00:23:06,483 --> 00:23:07,415
Hey guys!

252
00:23:09,653 --> 00:23:10,312
Saki!

253
00:23:10,754 --> 00:23:11,721
Ms. Saki?

254
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:14,954
Why are you at our office?

255
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:16,590
Boss, what is this?

256
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:18,286
Well, actually...

257
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:22,893
You moved to our office?

258
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:26,635
Yes, I hope you will
treat me kindly from now on.

259
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,504
What the hell are you thinking?

260
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:33,042
As I promised, I'll keep Kaori's secret.

261
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,608
But...

262
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:38,238
I never said I'd give up.

263
00:23:38,448 --> 00:23:39,574
Excuse me...

264
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:41,113
Hey Saki!

265
00:23:41,451 --> 00:23:43,112
You know what...

266
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,482
I won't give you up, either.

267
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:50,055
Ouch!

268
00:23:50,193 --> 00:23:51,490
Why did you do that?

269
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,893
Don't say anything strange in here.

270
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:55,994
Don't be so violent.

271
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,929
You should talk.

272
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:01,593
You are always so...

273
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:03,229
Don't nag me.

274
00:24:03,306 --> 00:24:05,297
What did you say?

275
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:19,716
Thank you very much.

276
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:24,349
Today is the last
day of my concert tour.

277
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:27,689
Without your support, I
couldn't have made it through.

278
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:33,563
I would like to introduce a wonderful
guest who will join me for the encore.

279
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:39,534
It is Ms. Saki Midorisawa,
who just joined our team.

280
00:24:43,113 --> 00:24:45,809
Good evening! I am Saki.

281
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:53,313
Please support me as you do Kaori.

282
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:54,821
Ms. Saki.

283
00:24:57,093 --> 00:24:57,616
Oh!

284
00:24:57,694 --> 00:24:59,286
What are you doing?

285
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:04,156
Never mind. Just wave, okay?

286
00:25:28,124 --> 00:25:33,528
<i>After racing</i>
<i>through a cheerful season...</i>

287
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:40,500
<i>...what will happen to the</i>
<i>footprints in the sand of my memory?</i>

288
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:47,470
<i>Tears are rolling down</i>
<i>to the beach of my heart...</i>

289
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:53,806

290
00:25:55,585 --> 00:26:01,217
<i>The sky is reflected in my heart.</i>

291
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:08,555

292

293

303
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:27,639

304
