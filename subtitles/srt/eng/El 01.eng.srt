1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,770
<i>l love you forever
This moment for ourselves</i>

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,110
<i>Now and then forever
ls beginning now</i>

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,980
<i>One by one
l want to make our memories</i>

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,680
<i>So please stay with me</i>

5
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,330
<i>Moonlight and stars are shining</i>

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,600
<i>And my body wants their light</i>

7
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,990
<i>Unknown love
Ordinary things in the city....</i>

8
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,270
<i>l love you forever
This moment for ourselves</i>

9
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,280
<i>Now and then forever
ls beginning now</i>

10
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,250
<i>One by one
l want to make our memories</i>

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,890
<i>So please stay with me</i>

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,600
<i>l love you forever</i>

13
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,230
<i>l love you forever</i>

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,470
You're destroying me.

15
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,010
Oh, Carlos.

16
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,230
lt feels so good!

17
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,980
Please enjoy your stay.

18
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,470
l wasn't interested in a boring position as a bodyguard for pop stars.

19
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,980
But it turned out to be such a pleasure.

20
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,510
lf you want to, you can have much more fun, Carlos-san.

21
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,360
Top-class snipers like you are admired by stars of the Vision Center.

22
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,820
A vision scope....

23
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,030
l don't like that. lt's like being put under surveillance all the time.

24
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,330
<i>Right, we might be under surveillance...</i>

25
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,580
...for the purpose of realizing the Megaro Earth Project.

26
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,150
Thank you for this wonderful night.

27
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,250
Too bad, Reiko.

28
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,790
l never imagined that a beautiful girl like you was a Black Widow.

29
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,620
Ouch!

30
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,670
Come with me to the Sniper Control Office.

31
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,740
How did you know?

32
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,580
Private eyes work quickly these days.

33
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,060
Everything we do is for Gimmick-sama.

34
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,530
<i>In 2030 A.D...</i>

35
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,440
<i>...nuclear war broke out over the environmental pollution issue.</i>

36
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,040
<i>Many people lost their lives...</i>

37
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,440
<i>...as did most living things.</i>

38
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,250
<i>People who survived on this barren earth...</i>

39
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,190
<i>...started a project to save human existence:</i>

40
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,170
<i>the Megaro Earth Project, our last hope for survival.</i>

41
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,310
<i>And this city was supposed to be the key for this project.</i>

42
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,890
Open.

43
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,910
Good evening, Sniper El Miles.

44
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,740
Gimmick!

45
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,900
How is the Megaro Earth Project by Uncle Sam going?

46
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,240
We Black Widows will never admit that kind of crap, though.

47
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,680
Fireworks will be up in the sky tonight at Hotel Paradise.

48
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,120
What? Carlos!

49
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,890
Gimmick, you've gone too far.

50
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,970
<i>Stop, I really don't know anything!</i>

51
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,080
Please forgive me!

52
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,510
Please release me. lt hurts so much.

53
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,180
We found traces of gunpowder on your hand, Natsuki-chan.

54
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,490
Please believe me. l don't remember anything.

55
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,160
Would you tell us about Black Widow members?

56
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,930
l don't know! l really don't know!

57
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,930
There are many ways to make you want to talk.

58
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,200
Oh, no....

59
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,470
Nobody at the Sniper Control Office...

60
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,600
...would buy that you don't know anything about it.

61
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,040
No!

62
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,380
<i>Please, someone, help!</i>

63
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,480
Reinhardt is a hard one.

64
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,290
l will go to the Media Center.

65
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,480
l'll go with you if you're going to see Bikks.

66
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
No!

67
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,580
Why not?

68
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,460
You're in charge of your own work.

69
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,930
Sniper Control Office

70
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,640
l don't like to be observed.

71
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,920
Hi, El!

72
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,690
Good morning, Chris! Are you getting ready to open the bar?

73
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,590
l heard about Carlos.

74
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,500
He'll never drink with us in this bar again.

75
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,570
You be careful, too, El

76
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,760
Don't worry about me.

77
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,400
l'll drop by later. Say hi to the bartender.

78
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,170
l will. Thank you.

79
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,390
<i>Hey, Parsley is not here yet.</i>

80
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,260
She might have gotten lost. This Media Center building is huge!

81
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,990
Please, Bikks-san.

82
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,630
<i>We can't allow anyone in here
except Vision Center staff.</i>

83
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,140
Pop stars like you wear such cute underwear, huh?

84
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,340
Please stop! Ouch!

85
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,110
Please! You can't do this, even if you are a sniper.

86
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,180
Reiko Mimami was one of these pop stars...

87
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,990
...which means that some of you might be Black Widows, too!

88
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,860
You seduced Carlos with this luscious body, huh?

89
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,420
That's enough, Rob! El will be here soon to help us.

90
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,120
<i>Then we will start the investigation.</i>

91
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,730
Am l late?

92
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,810
<i>No!</i>

93
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,610
What was that?

94
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,140
No, no! What are you doing? Don't come any closer!

95
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,010
Well, we just wanted an autograph from Parsley-san, the superstar.

96
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,220
You guys are Black Widows, aren't you?

97
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,920
<i>lf you know that, then we don't have to explain.</i>

98
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,800
We wanted to borrow your body for a little while.

99
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,770
Please, let go of me!

100
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,300
We are fighting for all humans.

101
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,830
And we need your help, too.

102
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,470
Who's there?

103
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,680
l'm a sniper. Don't resist, or l will shoot to kill, all of you!

104
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,550
You're safe now, Parsley-san.

105
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,590
Parsley....

106
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,540
<i>What's wrong? Are you all right?</i>

107
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,280
Hello, this is the Social Report Company.

108
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,850
Regarding your issue, we'll need some more time.

109
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,720
l knew it.

110
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,720
<i>Linda-kun!</i>

111
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,790
<i>Excuse me, Mr. Phillis.</i>

112
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,730
Have you finished your research for the Sniper Control Office?

113
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,670
Yes, those three men who attacked Parsley...

114
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,270
...we did not find any criminal records on them.

115
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,800
We keep all the records in this city.

116
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,410
Any idea why ordinary, good people...

117
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,740
...turn into Black Widows all of the sudden?

118
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,140
No, sir.

119
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,190
Please send that data to the Sniper Control Office.

120
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,070
l don't think it's helpful, though.

121
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,620
Yes, sir.

122
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,490
Excuse me.
- Hey, Linda-kun.

123
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,890
Yes?

124
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,560
l don't think that black panties look good on you.

125
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,670
Parsley.

126
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,370
You're awake!

127
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,750
You've been sleeping so long. l was really worried.

128
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,750
El has been working too much.

129
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,380
That's why she's a regular customer here at the Hospital Center.

130
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,290
l haven't been working too much.

131
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,730
Parsley-san has been with you this whole time.

132
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,330
Thank you so much for saving me.

133
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,030
But why were you attacked by Black Widows?

134
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,940
l guess it's because l am too beautiful.

135
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,440
But that endangered you, too.

136
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,980
You know what?

137
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,780
l will sing a song to cheer you up!

138
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,950
<i>l love you forever
This moment for ourselves</i>

139
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:18,030
<i>Now and then forever
ls beginning now</i>

140
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,170
<i>One by one
l want to make our memories</i>

141
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,640
<i>So please stay with me</i>

142
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,810
<i>l love you forever
This moment for ourselves</i>

143
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,910
<i>Now and then forever
ls beginning now</i>

144
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,640
How was it?

145
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,120
Don't you want to talk about Black Widows now?

146
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,090
l really don't know anything about it.

147
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,880
lt seems that you want to enjoy some more!

148
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,050
Having a hard time, Reinhardt?

149
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,290
Hi, Rob. Did you hear anything from the Social Report Company?

150
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,460
They're not doing shit as usual!

151
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,090
They keep saying, "We found no records."

152
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,330
Why the hell do they get to be on the top floor of the Media Center Building?

153
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,970
Don't complain, Rob. We still have this girl as a clue.

154
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,950
Hey, Miss. Do you like milk?

155
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,850
No! Please stop!

156
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,760
lt will make her want to talk.

157
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,120
What? No!

158
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,360
Don't be shy.

159
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,760
Please don't, please. For God's sake....

160
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,040
Be my guest.

161
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,520
Don't! l really don't know anything.

162
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,990
Please, someone, help me!

163
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,520
lt will ferment quickly since the milk's expiration date has passed.

164
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,800
My stomach....

165
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,910
l can't take this.

166
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,240
Please, forgive me. Please.

167
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,950
Please, take these off. l will talk.

168
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,820
l will tell you everything, please....

169
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,130
Rob, help her.

170
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,460
You need a plug so that it doesn't leak.

171
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,670
No! l'm scared. What are you doing?

172
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,200
Please, pull it out! Pull it out!

173
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,580
You look like you want more. Hey, guys!

174
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,990
Please, forgive me.

175
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,560
Please stop! Help!

176
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,760
lt hurts.

177
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,400
l'll tell you everything. l told you l will.

178
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,370
l see, you don't want to talk.

179
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,440
No. Don't!

180
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,850
Chris!

181
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,690
l heard that you fainted. l was so worried!

182
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,930
Nothing serious. Just anemia.

183
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,200
El will be fine as long as l'm with her.

184
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,170
l didn't know that Parsley-san was such a funny girl.

185
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,810
Hey, Rukka. You've got another rival.

186
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,240
Shit!

187
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,550
Hey, Miss.

188
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,820
l am one of your fans, too, and l always watch your shows.

189
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,890
Hello, l'm Parsley!

190
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,670
This is a present for El's sweet lover. lt's on me.

191
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,940
You guessed wrong, Jose. l'm just her bodyguard.

192
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,340
By the way, Bikks...

193
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,010
...any clues on those guys who attacked Parsley?

194
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,250
Nothing. Reinhardt and his men are investigating Natsuki now.

195
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,480
l see.

196
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,020
Let's not talk about that.

197
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,620
We've got Parsley-chan, our new friend!

198
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,060
Let's have a party tonight!

199
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,290
That's a good idea!

200
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,530
We haven't had a nice chick like her for a while.

201
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,420
More....

202
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,310
El hangs around with Parsley all the time.

203
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,110
ls she really attracted to Parsley?

204
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,690
Gimmick!

205
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,330
You're naughty, El-san...

206
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,930
...being by ourselves in a room when l'm so cute.

207
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,270
What are you talking about? Here.

208
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,670
Turn on the light!

209
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,180
lf my fans find out you slept with me...

210
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,950
...you'll be attacked by them.

211
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,680
Water!

212
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,020
Okay, okay.

213
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:46,800
Even fanatic camera guys have never seen this. Lucky you!

214
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,270
Okay, okay, l'm grateful.

215
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,840
l will show it to you. Only you.

216
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,650
Don't act stupid!

217
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,620
-Parsley?
-l'm suffocating.

218
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,350
-What?
-l'm suffocating.

219
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,720
Hey, Parsley....

220
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,590
Water!

221
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,270
Don't leave me alone.

222
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,760
Then we moved to the second phase.

223
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,950
lt seems to be going well.

224
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,420
Mr. Phillis, you're still here.

225
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,130
What are you researching until this late?

226
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,260
We keep all the records of this city.

227
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,410
We never have enough time.

228
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,970
l see.

229
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,160
<i>El, this is an emergency! Get ready immediately!</i>

230
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,660
Emergency....

231
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,670
We've surrounded 1991 completely.

232
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,570
We're breaking in!

233
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,520
Jose....

234
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,250
El!

235
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,200
Chris Ronchtat. We're arresting you
on the charge of being a Black Widow.

236
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,130
Listen, the Megaro Earth Project is...

237
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,770
We will listen to you closely in the Control Office.

238
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,230
Rob!

239
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,340
-Gimmick!
-What?

240
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,920
Rob, l'll leave it to you.

241
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,220
Bikks!

242
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,420
Thanks, l was having a hard time.

243
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,900
Reiko Minami. Was she Gimmick?

244
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,470
-Please let me go, El.
-l won't!

245
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,840
Please, l don't want them to....

246
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,800
But you....

247
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,080
Rukka!

248
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,350
Why, Rukka?

249
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,230
What's this?
