1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,250
In the 22nd century, due to
the population explosion...

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,200
...and diminishing natural resources...

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,200
...humanity spread out in all directions.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,900
Underground, on the
oceans, and out into space.

5
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:39,760
Aiding this expansion was the
development of a virtual computer system...

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,620
...the creation of new materials by
bio-tech firms, and the development of...

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,630
...advanced robot technology that
made the creation of Silhouettes possible.

8
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,070
But...

9
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,180
Stop!

10
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,550
If you don't stop within five
seconds, under law 104, chapter 7...

11
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,660
Are you okay?

12
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,930
I'm okay.

13
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,210
They destroyed the Silhouette.

14
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,940
The suspect is armed with missiles.

15
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,760
But the Silhouettes have become
widely used in many dangerous fields...

16
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:59,240
...and are now being used in
serious crimes, such as murder and rape.

17
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,270
W-What?

18
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,050
Let me taste a little.

19
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,190
You'll hurt yourself if you move.

20
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,320
What's happening?

21
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,530
Our research department was right...

22
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,170
You're useful.

23
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,770
Rika, good job!

24
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,880
You've mastered the block chop!

25
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,950
Now, if you break this stone, the
power will sync with the Silhouette.

26
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,890
Mimi the Silhouette
will create an electric wave.

27
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,090
It's a required skill for
surviving dangerous situations.

28
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,500
Ouch, that hurts!

29
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,570
Not good enough, Rika.

30
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,210
Your fighting skills are improving.

31
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,020
It will take time for you to
master them, but you can do it.

32
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,830
What are you going to do now?

33
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,460
I was just clumsy.

34
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,860
Are you done?

35
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,770
I'll have to be your
bodyguard for a while.

36
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,440
Yes, coach.

37
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,910
Can you get out?

38
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,290
If you don't move fast...

39
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,350
I'm going to do things like this!

40
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,460
Stop, Sandy!

41
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,460
Oh, your breasts are pretty big.

42
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,870
S-Sandy!

43
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,870
Try and escape now, Rika!

44
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,870
But...

45
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,000
Stop, Sandy!

46
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,200
If I were a pervert,
do you think I'd stop?

47
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,640
I won't stop!

48
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,550
How do you feel?

49
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,390
Feeling hot?

50
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,730
Because you're doing that!

51
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,510
L-I was asked to get you...

52
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,640
I'm on my way.

53
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,220
How long have you been there?

54
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,760
For a while.

55
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,810
Good morning.

56
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,070
Good morning.

57
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,070
How's everything?

58
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,110
After this experiment, the latest
model, Silhouette Mimi, will be completed.

59
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,760
It's different from a security or
service robot with virtual control.

60
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:56,160
It'll share all the human senses,
from consciousness to touch.

61
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,400
It's much more advanced
than an ordinary Silhouette.

62
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,590
That's our Rika.

63
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,600
Not just because of Rika.

64
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,500
It's also because of our staff.

65
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,930
Well, let's detach
Mimi and connect it to Rika.

66
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,840
Brain wave and pulse, normal.

67
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,620
Her ability as a manipulator is excellent.

68
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,120
Is that so?

69
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:42,040
We don't know why the most qualified
candidates are around 19 years old...

70
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:49,580
...but Rika is especially endowed
with intelligence, health, and stamina.

71
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,810
I guess old people like
me aren't qualified then.

72
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,220
Oh, no, that's not what I mean...

73
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,570
It's too much for Masa.

74
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,110
She's even sexier when she moves.

75
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,670
It's even more feminine than Rika is.

76
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,880
She feels as if she's really naked.

77
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,560
Masatoshi, check her skin sense.

78
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,930
Touch her body.

79
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,760
L-I got it.

80
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,500
Is this okay?

81
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,540
Okay, now check her lower body.

82
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,610
Lower body?

83
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,410
But I've never done
anything with Rika before...

84
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,950
Are you okay?

85
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,090
O-Ouch!

86
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,520
I guess so.

87
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,260
Rika, be careful.

88
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,200
Mimi's power is far
beyond human strength.

89
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,090
I'm sorry.

90
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,920
Thanks for waiting.

91
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,740
So, you slapped Masatoshi with Mimi?

92
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,320
You didn't hurt him, did you?

93
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,620
I just knocked him around a little.

94
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,330
That's how strong Mimi can be.

95
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,490
Cheer up.

96
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,930
This isn't like you.

97
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,270
Let's go home.

98
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,340
Hello, it's me.

99
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,280
They just left the office.

100
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,280
Get her when she's alone.

101
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,080
So, did he go home?

102
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,390
No, he's still in the lab.

103
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,320
I see.

104
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,620
He's really a hard worker.

105
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,050
So, how long have
you guys been dating?

106
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,650
Did you do it yet?

107
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,290
Stop it.

108
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,800
We're not like that.

109
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,230
Are you crazy?

110
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,200
You're so old fashioned.

111
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,720
So, I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

112
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,770
Okay.

113
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,380
We'll practice real hard tomorrow.

114
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,080
Stop it, Sandy!

115
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,940
What driving!

116
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,790
Flawless victory!

117
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,200
Is this the suspect in
the kidnapping cases?

118
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,830
Marvelous.

119
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,400
You son of a...

120
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,850
Ms. Rika!

121
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,330
Sandy didn't pick you up this morning?

122
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,270
It looks like she's missing.

123
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,670
Missing?

124
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:11,050
Her Countash is also missing,
so she might've had an accident.

125
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,550
She would have called, otherwise.

126
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:21,980
I wonder what happened after
she dropped me off last night?

127
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,650
We don't know.

128
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,630
But she's not easy to kidnap.

129
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,230
Even a male
bodyguard couldn't beat her.

130
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,490
That's right.

131
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,560
You be careful, too.

132
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,230
We'll get you another
bodyguard right away.

133
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,700
I'll be your chauffeur.

134
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,530
You?

135
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,640
Well, I guess it's better than nothing.

136
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,040
Father!

137
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,440
Don't worry about me.

138
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,450
I know the self-defense
techniques Sandy taught me.

139
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,160
You want Ms. Rika to protect you?

140
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,290
No, um...

141
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,890
I'll protect her!

142
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,460
Sandy...

143
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,550
Are you awake?

144
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,320
Who's there?

145
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,990
It's quite a sight, little Sandy Moore.

146
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,830
Let me go!

147
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,090
Sure.

148
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,040
If you'll be a Silhouette
manipulator for our organization.

149
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,910
Silhouette manipulator?

150
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,810
You know, it's something
your company working on.

151
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,850
Are you an industry spy?

152
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,280
Unfortunately, I know nothing about it.

153
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,860
No, a spy is already in your firm.

154
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:12,520
We really liked your work as a
fighter and a computer technician.

155
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,590
Where am I?

156
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,760
Who are you?

157
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,540
Can you promise?

158
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,940
To become one of us?

159
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,970
No way!

160
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,470
Let me go!

161
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,910
I guess we need the ceremony.

162
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,540
Ceremony?

163
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,010
What's going on?

164
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,420
What's...

165
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,860
What's this?

166
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,340
This is the ceremony that
will make you faithful to us.

167
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,730
Ceremony?

168
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,380
No, don't come near me!

169
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,510
No need to be scared.

170
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,350
They are controlled by
well-trained manipulators.

171
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,720
You are our...

172
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,920
Sandy, we are going to have fun.

173
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,340
This music will sound
soothing to you soon.

174
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,830
Subliminal stimulation.

175
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,270
You know a great deal.

176
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,980
Stop it!

177
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,050
You must want to know.

178
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,910
The real you...

179
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,190
Now relax.

180
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:55,400
Sandy, open your mind and
your body, and be one of us.

181
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,990
Be one of us.

182
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,170
Be one of us.

183
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,540
We will take you to a
world you've never been to.

184
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,980
To the world of pleasure...

185
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,280
To the world of pleasure...

186
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,950
To the world of pleasure...

187
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,660
Sandy, your body wants a man.

188
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,660
A man's finger.

189
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,660
A man's tongue.

190
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,830
A man's body.

191
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,890
A man's body.

192
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,200
You'll be our Silhouette manipulator.

193
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,180
Silhouette manipulator...

194
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,140
Silhouette manipulator...

195
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,890
More, more!

196
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,360
More!

197
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,790
This unit was designed to control the
feedback system for the Silhouette.

198
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,630
It will detach the excitement
patterns from the nervous system...

199
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,570
...so in case the Silhouette has a
breakdown, there won't be any feedback.

200
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,910
After attaching it, virtual
Mimi would be complete.

201
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,220
What?

202
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,810
To tell you the truth, it's lost.

203
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,940
Lost?

204
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,550
It was stolen?

205
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,890
Do you have any doubts about Sandy?

206
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,490
If she doesn't show up...

207
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,530
I don't believe it!

208
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,340
Now, you can be the Silhouette
manipulator for our underground fighting.

209
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,230
Thank you for going out with me.

210
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,960
Sorry about yesterday.

211
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,030
Did I hurt you?

212
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,170
A little.

213
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:51,200
So, can you stay with me tonight?

214
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,440
Okay, Rika?

215
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,480
So, you also think Sandy did it?

216
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,890
Oh, I don't know.

217
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,830
So, some stranger?

218
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,730
No, that's impossible.

219
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,000
Our lab's security can't be broken.

220
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,790
Then it's somebody from the inside?

221
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,460
But it's weird.

222
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,700
When you and Sandy
left, it was still in the vault.

223
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,910
So, who was the last
person in the lab last night?

224
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,080
Tell me who it was!

225
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,990
Well, our security
department is still investigating.

226
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,520
Maybe she has
nothing to do with this case.

227
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,980
Oh, my god!

228
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,060
Would you pick it up?

229
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,300
Ouch!

230
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,240
What's wrong?

231
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,280
No, nothing.

232
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,380
Hey, I really want to know.

233
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,080
If you tell me, maybe I'll
stay with you until morning.

234
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,280
Oh, I see!

235
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,720
Okay then.

236
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,590
It was me and Jessica.

237
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,220
Jessica?

238
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,590
The new technician?

239
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,460
Rika?

240
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,900
I'm sorry, I just remembered something.

241
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,440
Oh, Rika, won't you
come home with me?

242
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,620
I know it's not her...

243
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,020
Well, I'll ask Jessica.

244
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,690
But what if Jessica is the spy?

245
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,930
Is Jessica here?

246
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,260
Yes, you must be Rika.

247
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,340
I knew you'd come here.

248
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,470
What?

249
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,010
Hold it, come on in!

250
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,550
Jessica wants to talk to
you about Silhouette Mimi.

251
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,050
Mimi is right here!

252
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,290
Oh, I pushed too hard again!

253
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,620
Where is Jessica?

254
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:14,580
By the way you showed up,
you must think I'm the spy.

255
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,450
I knew you'd react that way.

256
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,510
Take a look.

257
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,290
Shit!

258
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,420
I won't let you go.

259
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,990
Let me go!

260
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,830
Don't touch me!

261
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,910
Oh, Mimi!

262
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,260
Iron Ox wins!

263
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,980
Now Iron Ox has won his tenth game!

264
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,110
We will pay your share
based on your percentage.

265
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,640
You may negotiate
that last game's rights with Iron Ox.

266
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,980
Our next match is...

267
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,750
Our audience is very lucky tonight.

268
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,050
This match is a Rape Match.

269
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,330
Also, our guest fighter is the
daughter of a corporate bigwig.

270
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,350
Of course, she's a
very talented manipulator.

271
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,460
And her Silhouette is a prototype!

272
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,640
A state of the art, girl-model Silhouette!

273
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,170
Of course, our Silhouette
is more advanced than hers.

274
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,110
It's about time for her to wake up.

275
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,600
Where am I?

276
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,990
Mimi?

277
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,070
Jessica!

278
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,270
It's time, Rika.

279
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,440
No!

280
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,080
If you want to survive, you'll
have to fight with the Silhouette.

281
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,910
Who are you?

282
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,560
Don't waste your time.

283
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,470
Whose voice is that?

284
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,740
Oh, you found me.

285
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,080
That's my Mimi.

286
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,210
Who could it be?

287
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,080
Sounds familiar...

288
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,220
I told you.

289
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,560
If you want to survive, you have
to beat him with your Silhouette.

290
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:57,830
Or would you rather be raped and have
the data fed back to your own body?

291
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,110
Shit!

292
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,850
Go to hell!

293
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,420
Hey, Sandy's
self-defense technique saved me!

294
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,460
Oh, no, I'm naked!

295
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,540
Ouch!

296
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,370
Leave me alone!

297
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,400
Stop!

298
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,450
It's a woman's sweet spot...

299
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,110
It was good that we
stole that safety mechanism.

300
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,640
You must be feeling
everything perfectly.

301
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,780
What?

302
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,790
What are you touching?

303
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,050
No!

304
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,730
That's against the rules!

305
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,460
There are no rules in this match.

306
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,870
You're so cute, Rika.

307
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,710
God, it's really a woman.

308
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,620
Please, stop it.

309
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,120
So, being a woman is your weak point!

310
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,730
Oh, no!

311
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,900
Being so sensitive is your weak point!

312
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,400
No, stop!

313
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,740
What are you doing?

314
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,610
No!

315
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,980
This is great!

316
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,250
She even moans like a real woman!

317
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,550
No!

318
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,750
No!

319
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,280
It's great!

320
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,750
It's too great.

321
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,620
What a Silhouette!

322
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,060
It's better than a human woman!

323
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,900
Now, I will take you from behind.

324
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,180
What the hell?

325
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,110
Take this!

326
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,220
I did it!

327
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,560
Good job!

328
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,300
But, he'll never be able
to use his thing again!

329
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,560
His thing?

330
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,770
It's okay.

331
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:24,740
We have somebody that's
a little better than him for you.

332
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,640
Now, for our main event!

333
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:32,640
We have our Lee
Corporation prototype.

334
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,910
Our top Silhouette!

335
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:39,320
I had it made
specially for such an occasion.

336
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,920
I am glad I'm able
to use it for this match.

337
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,720
Sandy?

338
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,000
Don't you think it looks like her?

339
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,700
What's wrong, Sandy?

340
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,070
It's me, Rika!

341
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,040
Don't bother!

342
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,670
She's just a
Silhouette manipulator now!

343
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,090
No, stop it, Sandy!

344
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,720
What's going on, Sandy?

345
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,920
Wake up!

346
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,990
This Silhouette looks like Mimi.

347
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,100
Technically, it's the same type.

348
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,300
Do they have the same power?

349
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,660
This is a pit fight!

350
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,440
I have to win to get Sandy back!

351
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,080
Wake up, Sandy!

352
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,660
No, I can't beat her after all...

353
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,400
It's getting near the end.

354
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,910
Here, Sandy.

355
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:13,710
I'm so jealous, Rika, your friend
Sandy is going to treat you so well...

356
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,290
What the hell is that?

357
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,590
Sandy, what are you...

358
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,870
Stop!

359
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,910
Sandy, why?

360
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,350
Please, Sandy, stop!

361
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,010
You did it, Jessica!

362
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,860
Now, Rika and Mimi belong to us.

363
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,930
We will get other Silhouettes from...

364
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,030
It's so good, so good!

365
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,330
I've always wanted you, Rika!

366
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,460
I love you, Rika!

367
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,540
I can't beat her with
my normal techniques.

368
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,700
I'll try this!

369
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,690
Damn!

370
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,500
Boss!

371
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,400
Oh, Dad!

372
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,140
Now what?

373
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,910
Was that Mimi?

374
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:53,910
Sandy!

375
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,720
Sandy, it's me, Rika!

376
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,820
Hang on!

377
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:00,920
Sandy!

378
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,840
Mimi!

379
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,340
No, Rika...

380
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,240
It was beautiful!

381
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,380
Oh, Sandy!

382
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,140
You're back to normal.

383
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,980
I guess...

384
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,910
But, you finally mastered that skill.

385
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,480
You really beat me.

386
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,320
Thank you, Rika.

387
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,690
Thank God!

388
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,590
Oh, we should name that
technique the Thunder Break.

389
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,560
Okay.

390
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:45,400
Oh, we have no time to chat.

391
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,400
Rika, fight with Mimi.

392
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,340
It's okay, you can beat them with Mimi.

393
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,500
I'll take your body.

394
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,740
Thanks!

395
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,320
Mimi, go for it!

396
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,090
You think you can get away with this?

397
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,190
Shit!

398
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,060
I can't let you go this time!

399
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,990
Get out of my way!

400
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,730
Don't come any closer!

401
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,940
How dare you
destroy my cute Silhouette!

402
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:25,840
I'll get you for this!

403
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,110
Now!

404
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,180
Wait!

405
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,220
Rika, what happened?

406
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,720
What's wrong with Mimi?

407
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,120
What is this?

408
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,690
Oh, Iron Cow.

409
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,630
Miss, why?

410
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,460
Mimi!

411
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,760
Rika!

412
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,710
Rika?

413
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,670
Did Mimi...

414
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,470
Oh, my god!

415
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,210
Rika, I'll take it off.

416
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,680
Rika!
