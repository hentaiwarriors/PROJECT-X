1
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:18,245
Sex Demon Metropolis

2
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:16,169
No!

3
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:24,677
NO!

4
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:12,028
Ready to feast!

5
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:14,358
Stop, you low-life!

6
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:18,999
Demon! Wearing
the skin of a human...

7
00:24:20,372 --> 00:24:22,397
Demons should only go screwing
around with other demons!

8
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:26,368
Yeah, I'm a demon.

9
00:24:27,178 --> 00:24:30,841
So what's so bad about that?!

10
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:32,972
Useless...

11
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:33,846
I mean...

12
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:38,585
Oh yeah!
She's a woman.

13
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:40,649
Lick!

14
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:44,255
What?

15
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:53,366
It'll take 1 00,000 years for the Sex
Demon's goons to lick even my feet.

16
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,132
You...
You're a...

17
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:09,086
Yeah, the one that's come to hunt
guys like you down, a vampire.

18
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:24,762
As time passes, covered
by a veil of stillness...

19
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,364
The frozen area is controlled
by a sympathetic feeling.

20
00:25:32,777 --> 00:25:35,268
The beautiful moons,
the Draculons.

21
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:39,246
The perishing remains
of their descendants.

22
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:43,682
Carrying a dark history, we return.

23
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:51,458
With the powers of God turning
us into the ones with wings.

24
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:56,167
I am Vampire Madonna.

25
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:05,274
Vampire Madonna Volume 01

26
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:25,760
These demons have been
on the move a lot recently.

27
00:26:26,364 --> 00:26:27,422
What could they be up to?

28
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,468
Slippery, slippery, slippery.

29
00:26:32,837 --> 00:26:35,237
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

30
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,103
What are they doing on this planet?

31
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,944
Mina, sister.

32
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:48,586
Aine's going to wash your back...

33
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:51,484
It's okay.
Just leave me alone.

34
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:54,057
No, you don't have to stop me...

35
00:26:56,027 --> 00:26:58,860
It's so sensitive, as always...

36
00:26:58,963 --> 00:27:01,932
That's not my back.

37
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:04,331
Who cares..?

38
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:07,063
S..Stop...
Stop it!

39
00:27:10,408 --> 00:27:11,875
Ah, Anne.

40
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:14,945
Anne, let's play
this game together!

41
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,583
Anne, stop her...

42
00:27:28,993 --> 00:27:30,984
Anne, so nice!

43
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:32,294
No, stop...

44
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,210
Anne is gone...

45
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:52,372
To her, it's so good...

46
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:59,313
This evening, a body was
discovered torn to shreds.

47
00:27:59,657 --> 00:28:00,749
The police have reported it as...

48
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:02,724
This is your handiwork, sis.

49
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:06,763
Yeah, but from the human's point
of view, it's still a homicide case.

50
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:10,366
There have been a lot of
incidents involving demons lately.

51
00:28:10,468 --> 00:28:13,869
This week alone there have
been four already. Five?!

52
00:28:14,706 --> 00:28:17,038
All this activity by them.

53
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:18,836
Something smells funny...

54
00:28:18,943 --> 00:28:20,968
This smells really nice.

55
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,579
S..S..Stop...

56
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:29,853
I haven't gotten any of
this for such a long time...

57
00:28:30,388 --> 00:28:35,052
S..Stop! I'm right in the
middle of having my period.

58
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,421
That's why it's so good.

59
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:44,893
We're Draculons.
We crave blood.

60
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:47,164
That doesn't mean...

61
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:53,904
Hey, sis, you're bleeding
a lot this month.

62
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:56,913
It calls to our hearts.

63
00:28:57,015 --> 00:29:00,314
Noooo...

64
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:03,777
Okay, we'll go out.

65
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:06,152
What? Going out?

66
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,122
Okay, but let me get one more lick.

67
00:29:09,694 --> 00:29:11,025
No! Not that!

68
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:11,754
Yes, yes.

69
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:14,192
Let's go and suck...

70
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:16,958
F-L-E-S-H!

71
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:20,131
F-L-E-S-H?!

72
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:24,698
You ladies want blood that much?

73
00:29:26,744 --> 00:29:29,212
The poor fate of Draculon's huh?

74
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:32,950
Let the powers of
darkness come inside...

75
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:35,815
And transform us
to our beast forms!

76
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:38,614
Let's go!

77
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:40,054
Yes!

78
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:36,209
Lord Karma, welcome back.

79
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:39,181
I have something to report,
so I waited for you.

80
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:41,946
What is it?

81
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,246
It's not easy for me
to say this, but...

82
00:30:45,356 --> 00:30:47,620
I don't care.
What is it?

83
00:30:47,925 --> 00:30:52,658
For some time now, there's been
someone interfering with our work.

84
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:55,494
So I thought we could get
help from you, Karma.

85
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,266
Someone's been interfering?

86
00:30:57,368 --> 00:30:57,993
Yes.

87
00:30:58,102 --> 00:31:01,333
If this goes on, we won't be able
to give our endorphins to you.

88
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,565
You guys are different
from the other humans.

89
00:31:04,675 --> 00:31:06,905
I bestowed upon you powers.

90
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:11,705
Do you understand why?

91
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:14,376
Of course.
To serve Karma.

92
00:31:14,952 --> 00:31:18,183
Yes, to serve me.

93
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:24,993
When humans are aroused,
the brain releases endorphins.

94
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:29,863
It is your job to collect them.

95
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:34,469
Yes, that is true...

96
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:37,737
Your lives are based solely
for that one purpose.

97
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:40,333
And if you can't
even do that for me...

98
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:42,846
Then you're of no use!

99
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:52,215
Fucking useless...

100
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:04,694
There's no sense for you to live
as either a man or a demon.

101
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:06,529
Stupid fools...

102
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:11,836
No one in the world
can fight against me.

103
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:17,943
This city will be mine to control
in only a matter of time.

104
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,073
Time!

105
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:23,714
I must take over
this city quickly.

106
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:25,618
The Sex Demon
King will do so...

107
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:47,103
...Women...

108
00:32:56,254 --> 00:32:58,119
Let's have this guy tonight.

109
00:32:58,656 --> 00:33:00,681
He looks healthy and very nice.

110
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:22,102
What's this? We can't get any
blood from this soft little thing.

111
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:24,207
Okay, let's do it!

112
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:25,282
Yes.

113
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:59,341
It's coming...
coming...coming...

114
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,042
Almost there...

115
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:22,767
It's so big!

116
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:41,153
Living blood is so good.

117
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:44,490
And some of this white
stuff makes it real sweet.

118
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,491
Today's meal tasted really good.

119
00:34:51,602 --> 00:34:54,332
We should get more of his blood.

120
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,713
So sleepy.

121
00:35:11,188 --> 00:35:13,884
Hey, Aine, what are you doing?

122
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:17,751
I'm going to college, of course.

123
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:18,760
College?

124
00:35:20,164 --> 00:35:24,362
Yes, starting today. Aine is
going to be a college woman.

125
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:28,261
Why would a Draculon go
to a human university?

126
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,438
That's because I'm
old enough to go!

127
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:34,477
Going out looking like that...

128
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:35,567
You'll dry up!

129
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:40,577
But I want to be a college woman!

130
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:41,982
Don't forget that we're Draculons.

131
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:43,246
During the day...

132
00:35:44,855 --> 00:35:46,413
An umbrella...

133
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:49,084
Yay, Anne! Nice one!

134
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:50,394
Hey, hey!

135
00:35:58,002 --> 00:35:59,162
No way...

136
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,068
There are demons
roaming this city.

137
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:03,572
What are they thinking?

138
00:36:03,674 --> 00:36:05,073
College women...

139
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:06,268
These demons must be killed, or...

140
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:18,521
Do you have your handkerchief?

141
00:36:18,622 --> 00:36:19,953
Do you have your homework?

142
00:36:20,057 --> 00:36:23,151
You're not carrying condoms
in your wallet, are you?

143
00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:24,588
Megumi!

144
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:27,690
Why are you always
hanging around me?

145
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:29,322
What do you mean, why?

146
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:30,866
I'm...Tatsuo's...

147
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:31,696
Old Lady?

148
00:36:32,603 --> 00:36:34,002
What?

149
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:38,271
Tatsuo, you're the one who
asked me out with a bloody nose!

150
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:40,867
That was back in elementary school!
Such a long time ago, and still...

151
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:42,002
Still what?

152
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:43,910
Now I'm going out with Kaori...

153
00:36:44,014 --> 00:36:45,242
Kaori?! Is she your woman now?

154
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:47,146
Are you an idiot? She doesn't
even know that you're alive.

155
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:47,945
- What?!
- What?!

156
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,812
That guy...

157
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:58,054
Thank you so much for
the fresh blood last night.

158
00:36:58,863 --> 00:36:59,761
Blood?

159
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:01,787
You didn't donate blood, did you?

160
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:02,923
No way.

161
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:06,526
We'll be attending this
university starting today.

162
00:37:06,637 --> 00:37:08,332
What's with the umbrellas?

163
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:09,929
We get weak from direct sunlight.

164
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,530
Hey,just like Dracula.

165
00:37:11,642 --> 00:37:13,234
Wow!Just like that!

166
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:20,244
A cross?!

167
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:22,512
What?

168
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:25,055
Of course. We're attending a
missionary-run university.

169
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:27,420
We have crosses and
churches everywhere.

170
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:30,853
Uh, hello?

171
00:37:47,812 --> 00:37:49,712
What...What did you women do?

172
00:37:50,314 --> 00:37:52,407
We don't like crosses.

173
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:55,985
Don't like...
What was that..?

174
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:57,986
Pro...Probably an accident.

175
00:37:59,256 --> 00:38:01,281
Did you see it?
Their power...

176
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:03,758
That's bad. They
can't be normal co-eds.

177
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:05,453
We must report this to Lord Karma.

178
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:15,272
So this type of human
walks this world now, huh?

179
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,537
No, no.
They were not human.

180
00:38:19,643 --> 00:38:20,632
Probably not...

181
00:38:21,345 --> 00:38:25,577
They're different from you ladies.

182
00:38:25,716 --> 00:38:31,348
As well as from any other demons
who have roamed this world.

183
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:35,386
Then who else could
possess such powers?

184
00:38:36,994 --> 00:38:37,756
Maybe?!

185
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:42,390
No, they should all be extinct.

186
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,867
But if it is one of them...

187
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:51,103
And they could be the ones who've
been interfering with our plans...

188
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:52,674
Draculon!

189
00:38:53,944 --> 00:38:55,172
It must be!

190
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,244
So, they are in this world.

191
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:03,843
That's very interesting!

192
00:39:04,021 --> 00:39:05,955
A Draculon's endorphins!

193
00:39:06,056 --> 00:39:09,822
Taking the vitality of a
vampire would be very nice...

194
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,258
They're not going to hunt us.

195
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:19,131
We are going to hunt them.

196
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:54,066
Lovely Kaori...
Lovely Kaori...

197
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:57,032
The only daughter of
the Oniyuri family...

198
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:59,336
And she's intelligent, with
great style and beauty...

199
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:01,738
Today...

200
00:40:01,845 --> 00:40:04,473
Today I will finally express
my deep love for her...

201
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:06,980
When I think of you...

202
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:11,578
Ah,just thinking of you makes my
heart and crotch both throb hard.

203
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:13,247
And night after night,
my right hand...

204
00:40:14,158 --> 00:40:16,683
Tatsuo, what is it?

205
00:40:18,095 --> 00:40:20,859
Um..Uh..Kaori...

206
00:40:21,298 --> 00:40:23,289
Funny meeting you in
a place like this.

207
00:40:25,302 --> 00:40:29,295
Wanna walk home with me?
I know it's not on the way, but...

208
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:30,769
Sorry...

209
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:36,877
I have tea ceremony lessons later,
so I'm getting a ride by car.

210
00:40:37,481 --> 00:40:38,140
I see.

211
00:40:39,116 --> 00:40:45,453
And also, Tatsuo, I don't hang
around with people like you.

212
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:47,615
So from now on, don't
come near me again.

213
00:40:53,263 --> 00:40:56,130
Hey! You just got dumped!

214
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:58,201
What is it with you women?

215
00:40:58,302 --> 00:41:02,238
I told you Kaori was
out of your league.

216
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:03,101
Shut up!

217
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:05,004
Compared to Kaori, you're...

218
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:05,976
You can't look at any
other women except for me!

219
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:07,645
Let's go, Anne.
You can't look at any
other women except for me!

220
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:08,304
You can't look at any
other women except for me!

221
00:41:08,412 --> 00:41:09,037
Why?!

222
00:41:09,146 --> 00:41:10,374
You have me!

223
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,676
What're you? My old
lady or something?!

224
00:41:12,783 --> 00:41:13,477
Yes!

225
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:16,911
Tatsuo.

226
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:18,579
Why don't you understand?

227
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:22,724
I love you so much.

228
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:24,521
Ever since we were young.

229
00:41:24,628 --> 00:41:27,028
I've always loved you...

230
00:41:27,197 --> 00:41:29,188
Me..Megumi?

231
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,726
But ever since college started...

232
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:33,598
You're always going
'' Kaori, Kaori...''

233
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:35,535
What kind of position
are you putting me in?

234
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:36,298
Shut up!
Shut up!!!

235
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:38,238
I don't recall ever
having sex with you!

236
00:41:38,342 --> 00:41:39,934
If you're saying that we're
together exclusively...

237
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:40,969
What?

238
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:43,276
Then start masturbating right here!

239
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:45,473
Masturabate?

240
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:47,550
Yes, masturbate!

241
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:48,913
Right here?

242
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:56,121
If you're the one, you should be
able to give any part of yourself to me.

243
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:57,193
But...

244
00:41:57,928 --> 00:41:59,156
Hey! You're my woman, right!

245
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:00,525
C'mon! Start doing it!

246
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:03,230
Okay, I'll do it!

247
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:06,902
You'll do it?
Really?

248
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:08,938
Hey, Megumi!

249
00:42:20,517 --> 00:42:23,008
Hey, you really don't
have to do this!

250
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:31,554
I'll show you how much
I love you, Tatsuo.

251
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:36,729
Show me..?

252
00:42:37,901 --> 00:42:41,530
Please look at me...

253
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:51,004
Only me...
Look only at me!

254
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:23,776
Tatsuo..?

255
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,580
Why can't it be me, Tatsuo?

256
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:36,151
Me, Tatsuo...
Tatsuo...

257
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:47,226
Vampire Madonna

258
00:43:48,872 --> 00:43:51,466
Won't forget this...

259
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,170
Yeah, like you could...

260
00:44:05,656 --> 00:44:06,850
They're only humans...

261
00:44:07,324 --> 00:44:09,224
Controlled by a demon's power.

262
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:13,456
Unless I kill the Demon Sex King
himself, more humans will be taken.

263
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:16,565
Where is that demon hiding?

264
00:44:17,201 --> 00:44:18,668
What is he up to?

265
00:44:34,484 --> 00:44:35,382
Sorry I'm late.

266
00:44:38,088 --> 00:44:41,649
Kaori, you are very late.

267
00:44:41,758 --> 00:44:43,123
I'm sorry.

268
00:44:43,227 --> 00:44:45,752
It took me a long
time to get changed.

269
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:48,923
The only daughter of
the Oniyuri family...

270
00:44:49,032 --> 00:44:51,967
Is it that you don't like
this tea ceremony class..?

271
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:53,400
- ...Or something else?
- No. Not that.

272
00:44:54,104 --> 00:44:56,095
Just be seated.

273
00:44:56,306 --> 00:44:57,330
Yes.

274
00:44:58,308 --> 00:44:59,502
Everyone...

275
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,601
Time to check your crotches!

276
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:21,730
Yes, everyone's rope
is digging in nicely...

277
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:25,266
Ka..Kaori!

278
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:28,031
What is that?
What are you wearing?

279
00:45:29,873 --> 00:45:31,204
Panties.

280
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:34,210
What's with you?

281
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:36,973
Wearing panties
instead of the rope?

282
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:38,571
S..Sorry.

283
00:45:40,517 --> 00:45:44,476
The rope, it hurts.

284
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:45,679
Okay.

285
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:49,054
You can't follow the
instructions I give you, huh?

286
00:45:49,693 --> 00:45:50,625
Ah, no.

287
00:45:51,194 --> 00:45:53,958
Today's lesson is finished...

288
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:56,055
Everyone please go home.

289
00:45:56,433 --> 00:45:58,697
Please excuse us.

290
00:46:00,137 --> 00:46:04,699
Kaori, you're going to
have a special class today.

291
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:06,501
Y..Yes.

292
00:46:27,364 --> 00:46:28,422
It hurts?

293
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:30,193
Of course it hurts.

294
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:34,493
It's tied very tight,
so it should hurt.

295
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:40,773
This is what happens when you
wear panties when you shouldn't...

296
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:47,143
Is it hot?

297
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,683
Of course it's hot!

298
00:46:48,785 --> 00:46:52,448
The inside of your
panties must be burning.

299
00:46:57,494 --> 00:47:00,759
My panties are burning hot.

300
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:03,462
Oh, how could I forget?

301
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:06,900
I forgot to stir the tea.

302
00:47:07,004 --> 00:47:09,939
No, professor.
Please stop.

303
00:47:13,443 --> 00:47:16,970
Stirring, stirring, stirring.

304
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:23,943
Stop, stop it.
Please, professor.

305
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:35,331
Professor, why..?

306
00:47:35,432 --> 00:47:37,093
Why are you doing this to me?

307
00:47:39,903 --> 00:47:42,497
Are you talking back at me?

308
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:44,267
No! No, but...

309
00:47:45,742 --> 00:47:49,075
Patience is a great part
of the tea ceremony.

310
00:47:53,116 --> 00:47:54,413
It hurts?

311
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:56,577
Of course it hurts.

312
00:47:57,687 --> 00:48:00,952
If it hurts, cry, scream!

313
00:48:02,192 --> 00:48:08,392
Then if the pain becomes pleasure,
you can cum as much as you want.

314
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:11,190
Then, then...

315
00:48:11,301 --> 00:48:15,499
Let your love juice
flow right out of you.

316
00:48:18,608 --> 00:48:20,132
Please stop this.

317
00:48:22,312 --> 00:48:23,836
Don't say that.

318
00:48:23,947 --> 00:48:25,107
For your professor...

319
00:48:25,215 --> 00:48:27,911
Give your feelings
over to Lord Karma!

320
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:16,996
Wait!

321
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:20,195
Your smell! You've got the
demon's scent all over you...

322
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:22,729
Hey!

323
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:29,136
So, the demons got to you, huh?

324
00:49:30,046 --> 00:49:30,774
Poor girl.

325
00:49:46,062 --> 00:49:50,021
Tomato juice is for
people who need blood.

326
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:52,601
Tomato Rin Z!

327
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:55,732
We Draculons...

328
00:49:56,606 --> 00:49:58,164
Yuck!

329
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:01,240
Hey, Megumi.

330
00:50:02,212 --> 00:50:04,407
Oh, Aine and Anne.

331
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:07,049
I was looking for you guys.

332
00:50:07,617 --> 00:50:09,414
Megumi, would you
like some tomato juice?

333
00:50:10,987 --> 00:50:12,750
No, actually I want...

334
00:50:13,456 --> 00:50:15,117
...something else..!

335
00:50:31,908 --> 00:50:34,399
She's pretty weak, but
she should be alright now.

336
00:50:35,512 --> 00:50:36,740
What caused this?

337
00:50:36,846 --> 00:50:39,940
I don't know. We'll have
to wait a while and see.

338
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:41,645
Okay.

339
00:50:42,586 --> 00:50:45,578
Doctor, do you smell something strange?

340
00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:47,113
Huh?

341
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:48,748
Sorry, it's nothing.

342
00:50:54,097 --> 00:50:58,329
Tatsuo, Kaori's been
taken to the hospital!

343
00:51:01,938 --> 00:51:02,802
That guy...

344
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,240
Excuse me,
It's Tatsuo.

345
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:06,741
I've come to visit Kaori.

346
00:51:11,047 --> 00:51:13,413
Welcome...

347
00:51:13,516 --> 00:51:15,450
It's past visiting hours, but...

348
00:51:15,552 --> 00:51:17,417
You're special.

349
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,852
We've been waiting for you...

350
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,052
Monsters!

351
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:24,683
This woman...

352
00:51:24,794 --> 00:51:29,788
No matter what we do,
she's still all dried up.

353
00:51:31,901 --> 00:51:36,634
So, we want to play with you.

354
00:51:45,448 --> 00:51:46,574
What?!

355
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:54,513
Draculon! Finally,
you've shown yourself.

356
00:51:54,624 --> 00:52:00,460
No matter what you do, our
plans will not be thwarted.

357
00:52:01,531 --> 00:52:03,522
But if this is allowed to go on...

358
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:07,899
It will be an insult to
the Demon King's pride.

359
00:52:08,004 --> 00:52:08,834
Lord Karma.

360
00:52:09,873 --> 00:52:11,204
My request.

361
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:12,707
Don't forget it.

362
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,599
I know.

363
00:52:15,779 --> 00:52:22,912
Like you, he'll become one of us.
Then let your love grow with him.

364
00:52:23,753 --> 00:52:30,522
Thanks to you,
we've captured those Draculons.

365
00:52:46,509 --> 00:52:49,239
Idiot! Watch out!

366
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:53,082
Sorry!

367
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:55,413
I'm carrying an injured person.

368
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,447
Soon we will be at Karma's.

369
00:53:01,858 --> 00:53:02,483
Wait!

370
00:53:07,931 --> 00:53:11,025
Damn! Why do I
care about this guy?

371
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:14,293
Injured, injured, injured.

372
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:17,201
Prepare yourself.

373
00:53:17,874 --> 00:53:19,068
No, you prepare yourself...

374
00:53:20,543 --> 00:53:22,568
Why don't you just die!

375
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:30,751
What?

376
00:53:33,423 --> 00:53:35,050
Pesky doctor!

377
00:53:35,158 --> 00:53:37,058
Don't get in my way!

378
00:53:43,633 --> 00:53:45,191
No!

379
00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:57,341
This...

380
00:53:58,181 --> 00:53:58,840
This is...

381
00:53:59,783 --> 00:54:01,307
The Demon Lair.

382
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:04,819
The Demon Lord, who turns humans'
lives inside out, lives here, huh?

383
00:54:12,595 --> 00:54:13,892
I..I'm...
What is this..?

384
00:54:14,197 --> 00:54:16,392
Don't worry.
I'm here with you.

385
00:54:16,699 --> 00:54:17,666
Why are you here, Megumi?

386
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:18,961
What is this place?

387
00:54:24,174 --> 00:54:29,077
This is where we're going to
make love, forever and ever...

388
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:34,079
I love you, Tatsuo.
I love you...

389
00:54:50,934 --> 00:54:52,925
I know you're here.
Come out.

390
00:54:56,072 --> 00:54:58,563
Welcome to Castle Karma!

391
00:54:59,342 --> 00:55:01,003
I've come here to destroy you!

392
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:07,142
Draculon's daughter...
Why do you hunt demons?

393
00:55:08,051 --> 00:55:10,713
There's no reason to
side with the humans.

394
00:55:13,623 --> 00:55:15,614
I don't care about the humans.

395
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,151
The only reason I hunt demons is...

396
00:55:18,628 --> 00:55:20,755
Because I'm a Draculon!

397
00:55:21,664 --> 00:55:24,428
Okay.
Go ahead.

398
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:29,062
You'll regret going against the demons!

399
00:55:30,373 --> 00:55:32,534
You have no more comrades.

400
00:55:34,043 --> 00:55:34,805
Aine...

401
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,605
Anne...

402
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:39,679
Those Draculons' endorphins were
really tasty.

403
00:55:40,183 --> 00:55:44,711
Those two have
no more energy left whatsoever.

404
00:55:45,855 --> 00:55:47,254
What?!

405
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:52,657
Thanks to them,
I've gotten so much energy.

406
00:55:53,029 --> 00:55:55,554
This much!
This much!

407
00:55:55,665 --> 00:55:57,633
THIS MUCH!

408
00:55:59,068 --> 00:56:01,434
You did that to Aine and Anne?

409
00:56:02,338 --> 00:56:03,168
I will never forgive you!!!

410
00:56:08,711 --> 00:56:09,700
Don't come near me!

411
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:14,482
I don't want any demons to love me!

412
00:56:16,686 --> 00:56:18,210
Wait, Tatsuo!

413
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:21,823
You're going to get to like me.

414
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:22,653
Please.

415
00:56:23,459 --> 00:56:25,620
With me.
Me.

416
00:56:25,728 --> 00:56:26,854
Or else...

417
00:56:33,536 --> 00:56:35,265
Weak, Draculon.

418
00:56:35,805 --> 00:56:43,143
You must be stupid, trying to
hunt us with those puny powers.

419
00:56:43,546 --> 00:56:46,538
You foolish Draculons shall perish.

420
00:56:46,649 --> 00:56:49,709
Hiding out in the human world.

421
00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:52,049
Now you're finished!

422
00:56:59,028 --> 00:57:00,188
Let me go!

423
00:57:00,296 --> 00:57:01,228
Disgusting.

424
00:57:01,698 --> 00:57:05,293
I shall now pleasure you
beyond your wildest dreams.

425
00:57:06,035 --> 00:57:06,694
Stop!

426
00:57:07,236 --> 00:57:09,261
I'm still a virgin!

427
00:57:09,405 --> 00:57:10,633
That's good.

428
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,005
A virgin's endorphins are fabulous.

429
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:16,170
Stop!

430
00:57:16,879 --> 00:57:17,903
Stop it!

431
00:57:18,815 --> 00:57:20,305
No!

432
00:57:24,487 --> 00:57:25,613
Mina!

433
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:28,218
Lord Karma!

434
00:57:29,425 --> 00:57:30,050
Who is it?!

435
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:33,996
Please, change me back
to what I was before.

436
00:57:35,531 --> 00:57:38,591
Tatsuo called me a monster.

437
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:42,905
He won't love me the way I am.

438
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,243
Even if he becomes like me,
he still won't love me.

439
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:50,771
Quit bothering me!

440
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:58,311
Ta..Tatsuo...

441
00:57:59,355 --> 00:58:00,413
I love you...

442
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:05,488
She interrupted us.

443
00:58:05,595 --> 00:58:08,393
Remember this moment when you
think about losing your virginity.

444
00:58:09,298 --> 00:58:11,766
I'm losing my viriginity
to this thing?

445
00:58:11,868 --> 00:58:12,493
No!

446
00:58:15,805 --> 00:58:17,534
No! No way!

447
00:58:18,908 --> 00:58:21,172
We're here to help!

448
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,243
Anne, you're okay!

449
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:27,316
Uh huh!

450
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:31,546
Mina, it is our duty
to protect you.

451
00:58:32,622 --> 00:58:33,884
Little pests.

452
00:58:36,025 --> 00:58:36,821
Ouch!

453
00:58:36,926 --> 00:58:37,915
Aine!

454
00:58:38,327 --> 00:58:40,557
Mina! Isn't Aine good?!

455
00:58:41,097 --> 00:58:42,257
Not good at all!

456
00:58:43,399 --> 00:58:45,560
No! I am good!

457
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,804
Damn. We can't continue like this.

458
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:55,075
Yes, if I can get some blood...

459
00:58:55,378 --> 00:58:56,242
Okay!

460
00:59:10,793 --> 00:59:12,818
How weird.
It's you...

461
00:59:12,929 --> 00:59:16,194
Your blood seems to give me powers.

462
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:20,902
W..What?!

463
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:33,273
Vampire!

464
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:37,309
If there be any law for
this land, I shall obey it...

465
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,650
Since I have no place to call home.

466
00:59:39,756 --> 00:59:42,520
But when the moon
burns from madness...

467
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:44,490
When the powers come within me...

468
00:59:44,594 --> 00:59:47,563
It will be time for you to die!

469
00:59:48,297 --> 00:59:50,265
You talk too much!

470
01:00:05,615 --> 01:00:07,515
Y..You...

471
01:00:16,392 --> 01:00:17,324
It can't be...

472
01:00:17,426 --> 01:00:19,291
Not like this...

473
01:00:20,763 --> 01:00:21,525
Answer me!

474
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,293
What are you demons up to?!

475
01:00:25,868 --> 01:00:26,732
Got you!

476
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:34,504
I'm going to steal your energy.

477
01:00:35,478 --> 01:00:37,139
You're a virgin...

478
01:00:37,246 --> 01:00:40,477
I'm going to take your virginity!

479
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:42,012
Stupid!

480
01:00:42,919 --> 01:00:46,548
Sticking such a weird thing
in such a weird place!

481
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:49,255
Damn!

482
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,451
I made a mistake!

483
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:56,165
It's useless...

484
01:00:56,499 --> 01:00:58,865
Draculon's Daughter...

485
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:06,536
The Demon Sex King's
descent is already...

486
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:21,356
The Demon Sex King's rule...

487
01:01:25,895 --> 01:01:28,386
Well done, Mina.

488
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:31,359
What are you doing?

489
01:01:32,501 --> 01:01:34,162
It's Megumi.

490
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:37,000
That stupid demon was using her.

491
01:01:37,807 --> 01:01:39,468
That's why....
That's why...

492
01:01:41,544 --> 01:01:44,377
Lucky! We made it in time.

493
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:48,784
Wasting precious energy...

494
01:01:49,952 --> 01:01:52,648
I don't feel anything
for humans or demons.

495
01:01:54,624 --> 01:01:57,320
That's because I'm
Vampire Madonna Mina!

496
01:02:02,431 --> 01:02:06,026
Going to college...

497
01:02:06,636 --> 01:02:07,728
Hey, you guys...

498
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:10,762
Why are you such
easygoing vampires?

499
01:02:11,173 --> 01:02:11,798
Hey!

500
01:02:13,342 --> 01:02:16,800
What's with those umbrellas again?
What are you guys, stupid?

501
01:02:16,913 --> 01:02:18,904
Stop, it's so embarassing.

502
01:02:19,782 --> 01:02:23,479
Oh! It's the woman in
the trenchcoat! Nice!

503
01:02:23,586 --> 01:02:26,180
How about you and I having
a quickie? Just one fuck!

504
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:29,892
You fucking perverted sex freak!

505
01:02:30,026 --> 01:02:32,256
Did I suck too much
blood out of him?

506
01:02:32,361 --> 01:02:33,726
No memory of anything, huh?

507
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:37,959
Yeah, next time we'll
suck all of your blood!

508
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,906
Still, I wonder what
that demon meant...

509
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,607
The Demon Sex King's descent...

510
01:06:30,308 --> 01:06:31,502
Beast City...

511
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:36,838
No one knows when they
started to call it that.

512
01:06:38,683 --> 01:06:40,913
The Beast Clan had
settled into this city.

513
01:06:41,553 --> 01:06:45,455
They tempted people with pleasure
to transform them into beasts.

514
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:49,356
As the Beast Clan numbers grow,
so do the city's citizens' fears.

515
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:56,466
But someone who has defied the
Beast Clan has come to this city...

516
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:00,704
Vampire Madonna.

517
01:07:02,374 --> 01:07:11,578
Vampire Madonna is a huge threat
to the Beast Clan's existence.

518
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:32,134
Vampire Madonna also has a voracious
appetite for sex with humans...

519
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:35,103
because her clan has
their own needs as well.

520
01:07:42,614 --> 01:07:46,675
Karma, who headed the Beast Clan,
fought against Vampire Madonna.

521
01:08:47,579 --> 01:08:51,515
The war between these two clans,
of which humans are no match for...

522
01:08:52,617 --> 01:08:56,178
ended because of Vampire
Madonna's overwhelming power.

523
01:08:57,489 --> 01:09:03,621
The war concluded with Karma
being destroyed by the Vampires.

524
01:09:04,362 --> 01:09:09,425
I felt the power from his death,
and I knew which path to take.

525
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,675
Yes, it's coming.

526
01:09:53,978 --> 01:09:57,141
The new world order is
beginning & I'm ready.

527
01:10:08,993 --> 01:10:11,518
Why...Why has it come?

528
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:15,656
The Beast that destroyed our home is
here!

529
01:10:15,967 --> 01:10:16,831
Why is it here?

530
01:11:28,139 --> 01:11:29,538
Worthless beast!

531
01:11:31,543 --> 01:11:32,703
Where are our comrades?

532
01:11:33,244 --> 01:11:36,680
They were chasing down beasts, and
haven't come back from section 7 yet.

533
01:11:36,915 --> 01:11:39,076
Guess they're doing what
they always do, right?

534
01:11:40,185 --> 01:11:43,916
No, please let me go.

535
01:11:51,262 --> 01:11:55,790
Let me get some of this sweet stuff!.

536
01:11:59,837 --> 01:12:03,295
How does that feel, huh?

537
01:12:04,142 --> 01:12:06,042
Please stop it, please.

538
01:12:06,511 --> 01:12:08,979
Hey there, lady, I'll play with you.

539
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,014
You won't be lonely anymore.

540
01:12:12,116 --> 01:12:13,845
Now let's get a look at everything.

541
01:12:16,688 --> 01:12:17,552
No!

542
01:12:20,024 --> 01:12:25,291
We're gonna protect
you from the beasts...

543
01:12:25,663 --> 01:12:31,033
That's why we're keeping you here.

544
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:37,030
Yes. There are a lot of
beasts roaming the city.

545
01:12:37,408 --> 01:12:41,742
The people of this area
cannot live without us...

546
01:12:41,879 --> 01:12:44,404
And our protection.

547
01:12:44,515 --> 01:12:49,077
So then...I guess you would have to say...

548
01:12:49,187 --> 01:12:52,554
We're better than having the beasts
around, wouldn't you say so, huh, baby?

549
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,208
Get off.

550
01:13:13,544 --> 01:13:15,205
Wait, dude...

551
01:13:15,346 --> 01:13:17,644
I'm gonna come soon...

552
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:24,044
Idiot! What makes you think I
have to wait for you?!

553
01:13:42,106 --> 01:13:43,095
Who are these females?

554
01:13:45,343 --> 01:13:46,310
Who are you?

555
01:13:47,345 --> 01:13:51,008
Hey, hey! We're here to
make you feel good, right?!

556
01:13:51,582 --> 01:13:54,278
Stick around creeps,
the party is just about to begin.

557
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,910
Huh? What? The party? What's that?

558
01:13:57,088 --> 01:13:59,249
Yes. Our little sex party.

559
01:14:00,124 --> 01:14:01,785
And your very excited endorphins...

560
01:14:03,328 --> 01:14:04,090
Endorphins?

561
01:14:04,595 --> 01:14:05,254
Are you..?

562
01:14:08,232 --> 01:14:11,724
Beasts?
You're beasts?

563
01:14:12,403 --> 01:14:14,268
It was you who wanted us.

564
01:14:14,405 --> 01:14:15,633
You can't reject us.

565
01:14:17,542 --> 01:14:21,239
Now, you give me your...your...

566
01:14:30,154 --> 01:14:32,349
I don't know about you but I'm
not interested, Anne.

567
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:36,089
It's okay for the
beasts to keep doing it...

568
01:14:36,227 --> 01:14:39,993
But self-control keeps us
from getting some ourselves.

569
01:14:41,232 --> 01:14:43,257
We've got few options
left because of this.

570
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:45,899
Let's go get some guy's
blood to keep us busy.

571
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,238
I'm falling.

572
01:15:00,618 --> 01:15:02,415
Aine!

573
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:05,818
Shit! What's happening?

574
01:15:06,824 --> 01:15:08,655
Why? Here I go again.

575
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,196
You crazy thing. Are you okay, Aine?

576
01:15:18,302 --> 01:15:19,826
It hurts a lot.

577
01:15:20,471 --> 01:15:21,130
What's happened?

578
01:15:21,506 --> 01:15:22,768
Beasts? Come back!

579
01:15:24,742 --> 01:15:25,800
Bat...Some kind of bat.

580
01:15:27,078 --> 01:15:27,942
Flying...all around.

581
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,138
Hit against some kind of wall...

582
01:15:31,315 --> 01:15:32,077
And fell down.

583
01:15:34,118 --> 01:15:34,880
Oh, I see...

584
01:15:36,621 --> 01:15:39,089
Damn it! Well it looks
like we've got trouble.

585
01:15:41,092 --> 01:15:45,620
We can't get out of this city.

586
01:15:48,299 --> 01:15:50,631
This barrier was put
up by the beasts.

587
01:15:50,768 --> 01:15:54,829
Us, the humans and the beasts
can't get out of this city.

588
01:15:55,373 --> 01:15:57,967
What are they up to?

589
01:15:59,143 --> 01:16:02,806
What is going on in this city?
We must find out quickly.

590
01:16:14,659 --> 01:16:18,117
A transfer student?
What's that?

591
01:16:18,729 --> 01:16:21,027
You don't know anything, college girl.

592
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:22,099
A transfer student is someone who
comes from one college to another.

593
01:16:22,099 --> 01:16:22,767
Tatsuo.
A transfer student is someone who
comes from one college to another.

594
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:24,435
A transfer student is someone who
comes from one college to another.

595
01:16:24,435 --> 01:16:28,735
Hey, Tatsuo!
A transfer student is someone who
comes from one college to another.

596
01:16:28,873 --> 01:16:30,738
TAT-SU-O!!!

597
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:35,402
Aine, what are you doing?

598
01:16:35,513 --> 01:16:36,314
Aine, what are you doing?
Megumi, do you know
you've got a few cavities?

599
01:16:36,314 --> 01:16:37,915
Tatsuo is peeping into your skirt.
Megumi, do you know
you've got a few cavities?

600
01:16:37,915 --> 01:16:39,050
Tatsuo is peeping into your skirt.
Two in the back,
and one in the front.

601
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:40,312
Two in the back,
and one in the front.

602
01:16:40,418 --> 01:16:43,046
- Do you get enough calcium?
- You know, he's a pervert!

603
01:16:43,621 --> 01:16:45,316
Everyone take your seats!
Quickly now...

604
01:16:46,657 --> 01:16:49,626
Allow me to introduce a transfer
who'll be joining us.

605
01:16:50,127 --> 01:16:55,224
Her university closed down,
so she transferred to this one.

606
01:16:55,366 --> 01:16:57,163
Her name is Seia Kannazuki.

607
01:16:57,835 --> 01:17:00,929
She is an excellent student.

608
01:17:01,072 --> 01:17:03,165
Study hard, everyone.

609
01:17:04,942 --> 01:17:06,409
I'm Kannazuki...Hello everyone.

610
01:17:06,511 --> 01:17:08,411
- It is nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too

611
01:17:08,513 --> 01:17:12,415
I'm Tatsuo.
My pleasure.

612
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:13,175
Here!

613
01:17:13,284 --> 01:17:15,684
Take a seat here, next to me, please.

614
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:16,946
Damn you, Tatsuo!

615
01:17:17,088 --> 01:17:19,056
What are you talking about?!

616
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:21,590
Nobody wants to sit next to you!
Who do you think you are?

617
01:17:21,692 --> 01:17:22,317
Shut up!

618
01:17:22,426 --> 01:17:24,553
- You've already got a woman, me!
- Miss Kannazuki.

619
01:17:24,662 --> 01:17:25,287
Yes?

620
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:29,364
You'd be better off not associating
with these kind of people.

621
01:17:30,301 --> 01:17:32,769
You know, I'd really like to but
I don't mind...

622
01:17:32,904 --> 01:17:35,805
No way. Especially him,
being such a bad influence.

623
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,199
There's a seat next to Kubota.

624
01:17:38,342 --> 01:17:39,434
Why don't you take
your place over there.

625
01:17:39,977 --> 01:17:41,706
Let's begin our studies.

626
01:17:41,846 --> 01:17:43,336
Everyone, be quiet.

627
01:17:51,289 --> 01:17:53,416
Megumi, 'cause of you
I couldn't talk with Seia...

628
01:17:53,558 --> 01:17:54,252
What's the matter?!

629
01:17:54,358 --> 01:17:56,292
What's your problem, huh, Tatsuo?
Seia is just Seia!

630
01:17:56,394 --> 01:18:00,421
I'm Megumi, you idiot.
I'm the only woman you'll ever need!

631
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:03,564
I have to interrupt your
little love quarrel.

632
01:18:03,668 --> 01:18:05,829
Excuse me, can you spare
some time to talk?

633
01:18:06,938 --> 01:18:07,870
Mina has something to say.

634
01:18:08,205 --> 01:18:14,610
Hey there, you're that fox I met before.

635
01:18:14,712 --> 01:18:15,940
Stop that!

636
01:18:16,213 --> 01:18:17,009
Megumi.

637
01:18:17,481 --> 01:18:19,381
I'm interested in talking with you.

638
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:20,781
Huh?

639
01:18:21,586 --> 01:18:22,484
Me?

640
01:18:23,187 --> 01:18:24,313
Why? What's up?

641
01:18:26,324 --> 01:18:28,087
Stop...

642
01:18:29,193 --> 01:18:32,959
Which group are you with?

643
01:18:50,214 --> 01:18:52,205
Feels good, doesn't it Professor?

644
01:18:52,617 --> 01:18:54,915
Miss Kannazuki, you're...

645
01:18:55,286 --> 01:19:00,087
Professor, I wanted to sit next
to that cute guy Tatsuo.

646
01:19:00,224 --> 01:19:01,885
But you kept him from me.

647
01:19:02,259 --> 01:19:04,853
No, I didn't know, I didn't mean to.

648
01:19:04,996 --> 01:19:09,228
I do not believe you.
I will not forgive you for that.

649
01:19:13,337 --> 01:19:15,737
I'm going to give you punishment now,
Professor.

650
01:19:15,873 --> 01:19:18,137
Don't do that to your professor.

651
01:19:18,275 --> 01:19:20,971
I'm your professor,
why are you doing this to me..? Don't!

652
01:19:28,152 --> 01:19:30,677
Take this and this and this!

653
01:19:37,028 --> 01:19:39,360
Say that you're sorry!
Say you're sorry!

654
01:19:40,498 --> 01:19:41,556
Everything's ready, Seia.

655
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:50,837
Stop this!

656
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:54,500
What more do you want from me?

657
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:56,910
I want you to apologize to Seia.

658
01:19:57,048 --> 01:19:58,743
I want you to swear your undying
sexual loyalty only to me.

659
01:19:58,849 --> 01:19:59,838
Why? Seia.

660
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,889
Apologize, apologize to me.

661
01:20:11,028 --> 01:20:12,586
Apologize to Seia.

662
01:20:15,032 --> 01:20:20,834
I am sorry.

663
01:20:21,806 --> 01:20:23,364
Please stop this, Miss Seia.

664
01:20:23,507 --> 01:20:26,169
I promise I'll do whatever you want.

665
01:20:27,545 --> 01:20:28,534
Is that right?

666
01:20:30,414 --> 01:20:32,939
Will you swear your undying
loyalty to me forever?

667
01:20:34,151 --> 01:20:38,451
I want you to be my slave and do
my bidding forever and ever.

668
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:45,021
What..What are you doing?

669
01:20:45,496 --> 01:20:48,124
No!

670
01:20:51,068 --> 01:20:52,865
You lucky slave!
You're going to be a slave...

671
01:20:53,003 --> 01:20:54,493
...and belong to Seia just like us.

672
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:03,444
How very nasty.

673
01:21:03,948 --> 01:21:06,712
Professor, you sure know
how to make these roses grow.

674
01:21:07,418 --> 01:21:10,581
Now, it's time to wrap this up
and get everything prepared.

675
01:21:11,055 --> 01:21:12,545
Yes, Master Seia.

676
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:14,953
No, stop!

677
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:16,485
Leave me alone!

678
01:21:18,129 --> 01:21:20,859
Feel...Feel more.

679
01:21:20,998 --> 01:21:23,728
Give me all of your feelings.

680
01:21:23,868 --> 01:21:27,360
Yes, you're going
to be a good pet.

681
01:21:47,691 --> 01:21:50,353
I didn't know that this
city had such a place.

682
01:21:51,028 --> 01:21:53,690
I've been thinking that this
building was kind of strange.

683
01:21:53,831 --> 01:21:55,822
But, I guess I never thought that...

684
01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:58,859
You've been here
before, right?

685
01:21:59,003 --> 01:21:59,901
Oh, have I?

686
01:22:00,037 --> 01:22:00,765
Yes.

687
01:22:00,905 --> 01:22:03,874
Aine and Anne caused
you to lose some of your memory...

688
01:22:04,008 --> 01:22:05,032
But you can still remember.

689
01:22:07,011 --> 01:22:11,277
No, your blood has the
remnant of you being a beast!

690
01:22:12,883 --> 01:22:13,850
What are we doing here?

691
01:22:19,156 --> 01:22:22,091
Tatsuo and I are going
to make love here.

692
01:22:22,226 --> 01:22:24,353
We're going to make love forever.

693
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:27,757
I love you, Tatsuo...

694
01:22:27,898 --> 01:22:29,297
I love you.

695
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:35,470
What..What are you talking about?

696
01:22:36,574 --> 01:22:38,132
Do you think I used to be a beast?

697
01:22:38,275 --> 01:22:40,903
That I was killed
because I attacked Tatsuo?

698
01:22:41,045 --> 01:22:41,943
Are you kidding me?

699
01:22:46,584 --> 01:22:48,848
What?! What are you?

700
01:22:49,587 --> 01:22:50,417
I am Mina.

701
01:22:50,921 --> 01:22:53,116
My home was destroyed by the Beast.

702
01:22:53,257 --> 01:22:59,594
I was born only to destroy the beasts
and all their ugly hosts. I'm a vampire.

703
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,932
Monster!

704
01:23:04,068 --> 01:23:06,059
You're a monster
just like the beasts!

705
01:23:06,203 --> 01:23:09,001
You may think I'm a monster.

706
01:23:09,139 --> 01:23:11,369
But I'm not a beast.

707
01:23:11,508 --> 01:23:13,408
I don't carry the
evil the beasts do.

708
01:23:13,544 --> 01:23:18,072
They exist to fulfill their desires
and kill to feed their lusts.

709
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:21,814
I..I can't believe it...

710
01:23:28,025 --> 01:23:29,652
What..?
Beasts..?

711
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,489
Vampires..?

712
01:23:31,595 --> 01:23:32,823
I have nothing to do with...

713
01:23:37,801 --> 01:23:40,099
- No! Let me go!
- Why?!

714
01:23:40,204 --> 01:23:44,038
I can smell the beast in you!
Your very nature gives off this scent.

715
01:23:45,609 --> 01:23:47,839
Tell me, did Karma call for you or...

716
01:23:47,978 --> 01:23:49,673
Did you call for Karma?

717
01:23:50,714 --> 01:23:55,447
Tell me, do you crave the
desires the beasts have?

718
01:23:56,186 --> 01:23:58,484
Why have the beasts come here?

719
01:23:58,622 --> 01:24:02,524
Tell me! What are
the beasts up to?

720
01:24:05,062 --> 01:24:06,893
No! Stop it!

721
01:24:13,537 --> 01:24:14,936
Who are you..?

722
01:24:15,072 --> 01:24:16,835
A beast?
A human being?

723
01:24:16,941 --> 01:24:17,771
Or...

724
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:22,104
What?

725
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:27,006
What is this power?
Tell me, how did you do that?

726
01:24:27,117 --> 01:24:28,846
Please, don't ask me.

727
01:24:29,887 --> 01:24:32,549
Keep away from me.

728
01:24:32,756 --> 01:24:35,919
I don't want to fight you.

729
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:39,757
I was born only to fight against
the power which will destroy this world.

730
01:24:40,364 --> 01:24:41,194
I only...

731
01:24:41,865 --> 01:24:43,730
I only want to love Tatsuo...

732
01:24:43,867 --> 01:24:45,767
To be with Tatsuo...

733
01:24:46,704 --> 01:24:49,832
Stop. I didn't want to hear that.
That wasn't what I asked you...

734
01:24:50,474 --> 01:24:52,101
I...love...him...

735
01:24:54,678 --> 01:24:56,202
Oh, how unfortunate for you.

736
01:24:58,449 --> 01:25:01,612
Your destiny has
splintered into two.

737
01:25:03,053 --> 01:25:06,216
One is for the one you love,
while the other is...

738
01:25:06,357 --> 01:25:07,085
No...

739
01:25:07,825 --> 01:25:08,951
It can't happen...

740
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:10,558
It can't be...

741
01:25:15,766 --> 01:25:16,494
So...

742
01:25:17,735 --> 01:25:21,330
You couldn't meet with the male?

743
01:25:21,438 --> 01:25:23,736
I'm sorry, Father.

744
01:25:23,841 --> 01:25:26,071
There weren't any chances
for us while at the university.

745
01:25:26,543 --> 01:25:28,010
Father, please don't worry about it!

746
01:25:28,145 --> 01:25:30,375
The Professor has been
now brought to our side.

747
01:25:30,514 --> 01:25:31,276
In a few days...

748
01:25:31,682 --> 01:25:32,512
Silence!

749
01:25:41,592 --> 01:25:42,786
In a few days?

750
01:25:42,926 --> 01:25:45,827
How dare you suggest that?!

751
01:25:47,064 --> 01:25:51,467
Do you understand why
you are still able to exist?

752
01:25:54,538 --> 01:25:59,305
You can't live without me.

753
01:26:02,212 --> 01:26:05,545
Forgive me, Father, please.

754
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:09,346
Please forgive us, Father.

755
01:26:10,454 --> 01:26:13,855
That's enough, Father.
You may leave them alone.

756
01:26:13,991 --> 01:26:16,425
They've done well.

757
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,050
Both of them have done well
as my slaves...

758
01:26:18,195 --> 01:26:19,219
And they have pleased me as my pets...

759
01:26:20,064 --> 01:26:21,190
But...Seia

760
01:26:21,331 --> 01:26:24,425
I really hate having
such a nasty father, you know.

761
01:26:26,036 --> 01:26:28,231
All right, as you wish, Seia.

762
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:33,301
However, you've failed to keep
your promise to me Seia, right?

763
01:26:33,744 --> 01:26:37,578
Oh, Father, I know I will do
as I promised you faithfully.

764
01:26:38,115 --> 01:26:40,640
I'm sorry.

765
01:26:41,318 --> 01:26:43,047
The university is very interesting.

766
01:26:43,187 --> 01:26:45,917
Why didn't you have
me attend sooner?

767
01:26:46,457 --> 01:26:49,324
If something were
to happen to Seia...

768
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:52,160
You worry too much about me, Father.

769
01:26:53,097 --> 01:26:54,257
But, Tatsuo...

770
01:26:54,932 --> 01:26:57,833
That really sexy guy you recommended?

771
01:26:59,069 --> 01:27:03,369
I don't believe he is worth
receiving Seia's love.

772
01:27:04,108 --> 01:27:05,075
Oh, but...

773
01:27:05,209 --> 01:27:06,938
I'll just do it for you, Father.

774
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:10,078
Thank you, Seia.

775
01:27:11,048 --> 01:27:13,516
I love you much more
than anyone else.

776
01:27:14,351 --> 01:27:20,483
I created the Kannazuki Group,
and I created these beasts.

777
01:27:21,492 --> 01:27:24,086
Everything I do, I do
because I love you.

778
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:28,791
All of this comes
from my love for you.

779
01:27:30,601 --> 01:27:35,402
Seia, I can do everything
and anything for you.

780
01:27:38,342 --> 01:27:39,240
Prepare for injection!

781
01:27:48,519 --> 01:27:53,923
Father, give it to me...
please give it to me...

782
01:27:54,525 --> 01:27:55,184
What's that?

783
01:27:55,726 --> 01:27:59,355
Please..Please give it to me...

784
01:28:00,664 --> 01:28:01,358
Bitch!

785
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:05,596
You just can't figure it out...

786
01:28:05,736 --> 01:28:07,226
What am I going to do?

787
01:28:09,806 --> 01:28:16,234
What should I do with this city,
with this world, and what's to come?

788
01:28:32,496 --> 01:28:34,794
Who are you?

789
01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:38,891
The procedure here is that you should
talk to the Assistant Dean first.

790
01:28:42,539 --> 01:28:44,006
Get out!

791
01:28:44,441 --> 01:28:46,170
This is my seat.

792
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:48,574
Sit in your own seat!

793
01:28:49,846 --> 01:28:51,711
I don't care if you're new here.

794
01:28:51,815 --> 01:28:52,645
Shut up!

795
01:28:52,783 --> 01:28:54,808
Don't worry, miss, you can sit
wherever you want.

796
01:28:54,952 --> 01:28:58,149
Hey, you, how about sitting in
Megumi's seat?

797
01:28:58,288 --> 01:28:59,687
Oh, miss...Right, Seia?

798
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:01,485
What's that?! That's bullshit.

799
01:29:01,592 --> 01:29:02,854
- I'm so happy.
- You can't just do that to me.

800
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,484
Seia's sitting next to me and
that fucking Megumi is absent...

801
01:29:04,595 --> 01:29:07,291
It's my favorite seat.

802
01:29:07,397 --> 01:29:10,127
Now you think you can just move me
around like a cow...why I'll.

803
01:29:10,234 --> 01:29:11,997
And...And..!

804
01:29:13,637 --> 01:29:15,730
Will you shut your foolish mouth!

805
01:29:15,872 --> 01:29:18,204
Why do you insist on
interrupting my group?

806
01:29:18,342 --> 01:29:19,138
Professor...

807
01:29:19,276 --> 01:29:22,006
Miss Seia wants to sit in this seat.

808
01:29:22,145 --> 01:29:24,340
Be quiet and just let her have it!

809
01:29:25,148 --> 01:29:26,740
What's the matter with the Professor?

810
01:29:26,883 --> 01:29:28,111
How did she get so strong?

811
01:29:28,952 --> 01:29:30,283
How scary...

812
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:33,651
Anyway, now you can sit
next to me in peace and quiet.

813
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,553
Please be good to me,
I'm such a gentle soul

814
01:29:35,692 --> 01:29:38,786
I feel the same way.
Please be good to me, Tatsuo.

815
01:29:39,229 --> 01:29:40,526
Excuse me.

816
01:29:40,998 --> 01:29:44,559
I've just transferred into this
college today, and my name is Mina.

817
01:29:45,002 --> 01:29:45,991
Please be good to me!

818
01:29:47,371 --> 01:29:48,668
Mina! How did we get so lucky?

819
01:29:50,207 --> 01:29:51,606
What? A new transfer?

820
01:29:51,708 --> 01:29:54,199
Why the hell didn't I hear
anything about you...

821
01:29:54,444 --> 01:29:56,503
Sorry if he didn't tell you about this,

822
01:29:56,613 --> 01:29:59,673
'' Permit''.
but I got permission
from the Dean himself.

823
01:30:01,285 --> 01:30:02,877
So, now that we got that out of the way,

824
01:30:02,986 --> 01:30:06,422
is there an extra seat
for me to sit in, Professor?

825
01:30:13,397 --> 01:30:15,695
Mina, you're so forward...

826
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:18,358
You don't like women like me?

827
01:30:19,036 --> 01:30:20,901
Of course I like them.

828
01:30:22,739 --> 01:30:27,642
Promise me you'll keep away from
all other women except for me.

829
01:30:30,314 --> 01:30:34,478
Don't you know that I've been so excited
to get you ever since I've met you?

830
01:30:35,485 --> 01:30:36,645
You have?

831
01:30:37,387 --> 01:30:38,945
Me too...

832
01:30:40,157 --> 01:30:40,782
Really?

833
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,048
Check!

834
01:30:42,526 --> 01:30:43,788
Bingo!

835
01:30:44,227 --> 01:30:45,888
Tatsuo, get it up!

836
01:30:45,996 --> 01:30:47,395
- Get it up!
- No! Not here!

837
01:30:47,497 --> 01:30:49,692
But, ejaculating here at college...

838
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:50,458
Oh, Professor!

839
01:30:51,234 --> 01:30:53,361
What are you doing here?

840
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:54,937
Try to act properly
with the other people.

841
01:30:55,038 --> 01:30:57,233
What's going on with you two?

842
01:30:57,374 --> 01:30:59,569
No, nothing's going on.

843
01:30:59,676 --> 01:31:01,143
Everything we're doing
here is innocent...

844
01:31:01,244 --> 01:31:03,804
Nothing out of the ordinary,
just a little...

845
01:31:03,914 --> 01:31:04,972
Bingo!

846
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:08,245
I'll play Bingo too!

847
01:31:09,152 --> 01:31:09,914
Here?

848
01:31:11,221 --> 01:31:13,689
I'll let you touch my...

849
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:14,779
All right!

850
01:31:14,925 --> 01:31:15,949
I won't forgive this.

851
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,757
Ah, yes! Yes!

852
01:31:18,862 --> 01:31:20,557
Feels so good...

853
01:31:20,697 --> 01:31:21,925
Kill them.

854
01:31:22,466 --> 01:31:23,626
Bingo!

855
01:31:23,734 --> 01:31:25,258
Finger Click!

856
01:31:29,172 --> 01:31:30,366
So, you're a beast!

857
01:31:30,507 --> 01:31:33,999
I knew you would show yourself if
I started getting close to Tatsuo.

858
01:31:34,544 --> 01:31:35,374
Get out of here, Tatsuo!

859
01:31:36,546 --> 01:31:38,013
I'm going!

860
01:31:39,683 --> 01:31:41,776
I will never forgive anyone...

861
01:31:41,918 --> 01:31:43,818
Who keeps me from my prey!

862
01:31:44,321 --> 01:31:46,221
He is none of your business! Take this.

863
01:31:47,624 --> 01:31:48,352
Beast!

864
01:31:49,025 --> 01:31:50,083
Beast, beast, beast!

865
01:31:50,927 --> 01:31:51,894
Oh, my God!

866
01:31:52,028 --> 01:31:54,360
Our professor turned into a beast
when Mina and I were fooling around.

867
01:31:54,464 --> 01:31:56,830
I can't believe what I just saw there.
You're not going to believe it either.

868
01:31:57,234 --> 01:31:59,794
This place is really dangerous,
isn't it?

869
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:04,766
Tatsuo, I have another idea. Why don't
you come to a safe place with us?

870
01:32:08,945 --> 01:32:10,845
Who am I?

871
01:32:11,948 --> 01:32:13,438
Am I possessed by the beast?

872
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:17,352
Am I no longer an ordinary
human being now?

873
01:32:18,321 --> 01:32:20,687
I like Tatsuo, I really love him...

874
01:32:20,824 --> 01:32:23,156
But did I attack and
try to kill Tatsuo..?

875
01:32:25,595 --> 01:32:26,653
No.

876
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:27,888
I don't want to change.

877
01:32:28,432 --> 01:32:29,922
No, I don't want to.

878
01:32:31,535 --> 01:32:33,230
Not now...

879
01:32:35,806 --> 01:32:37,171
Beast!

880
01:32:37,841 --> 01:32:39,502
The professor of
Room 3 is a beast!

881
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:49,246
This power you possess doesn't
come from the Beast world.

882
01:32:49,386 --> 01:32:52,981
You're getting in
the way of all our plans.

883
01:32:53,623 --> 01:32:54,351
Who are you?

884
01:32:55,058 --> 01:32:55,717
I'm Mina.

885
01:32:55,859 --> 01:32:59,351
Our home was destroyed when you
attempted to resurrect the Beast.

886
01:32:59,463 --> 01:33:00,691
I'm a vampire!

887
01:33:01,231 --> 01:33:03,358
I shall destroy you, beast...

888
01:33:04,734 --> 01:33:06,326
You chicken!
I'm not done talking yet!

889
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:08,633
Shut up!

890
01:33:08,738 --> 01:33:11,832
I have never heard Seia mention
anything about vampires before.

891
01:33:11,975 --> 01:33:14,603
But if you want to fight...

892
01:33:14,744 --> 01:33:16,678
I will show you no mercy.

893
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:17,439
Aine!

894
01:33:17,547 --> 01:33:19,640
Oh, please show mercy...

895
01:33:33,363 --> 01:33:34,125
What's that?

896
01:33:34,631 --> 01:33:38,590
Will you quit it with that thing!

897
01:33:40,036 --> 01:33:44,132
I'll kill this woman if
you get in our way again.

898
01:33:46,009 --> 01:33:47,442
Oh, Aine.

899
01:33:49,179 --> 01:33:51,670
I will never let you escape.

900
01:33:52,616 --> 01:33:54,015
Seia's room?

901
01:33:54,150 --> 01:33:56,015
Right?

902
01:33:56,753 --> 01:33:58,152
Yes, Tatsuo,
it certainly is safe here...

903
01:33:58,288 --> 01:34:00,017
And now we can do something
that'll make us all feel good.

904
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:03,387
Wait...

905
01:34:05,662 --> 01:34:07,254
You've got such a nice piece.

906
01:34:08,098 --> 01:34:10,328
Why do you want to sleep with me?

907
01:34:11,701 --> 01:34:13,328
Just play and have fun with Seia.

908
01:34:16,606 --> 01:34:19,074
I'll make you feel real good.

909
01:34:22,312 --> 01:34:23,540
You are so cute.

910
01:34:24,681 --> 01:34:26,171
You can touch me here.

911
01:34:42,866 --> 01:34:45,266
Feels so good, Tatsuo.

912
01:34:45,402 --> 01:34:46,960
More, for Seia.

913
01:34:47,103 --> 01:34:48,263
S..Seia.

914
01:34:56,746 --> 01:34:58,737
I'm feeling good too.

915
01:35:51,468 --> 01:35:54,437
You're mine forever.
You're feeling good, right, Tatsuo?

916
01:35:57,774 --> 01:36:01,107
Wonderful, so wonderful, Seia.

917
01:36:01,544 --> 01:36:03,739
You really are good, daughter.

918
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:07,907
My dream will finally come true.
I will attain that awesome power.

919
01:36:11,221 --> 01:36:12,051
What's happened?!

920
01:36:12,589 --> 01:36:13,783
Miss Seia!

921
01:36:15,025 --> 01:36:18,461
That woman who calls herself a
vampire is trying to ruin your...

922
01:36:19,062 --> 01:36:20,393
Miss Seia...

923
01:36:22,032 --> 01:36:23,090
What's that?

924
01:36:24,167 --> 01:36:30,037
Kannazuki has been amassing a
huge amount of power these days.

925
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,700
Why do the beasts
head towards there?

926
01:36:34,477 --> 01:36:35,808
Miss Seia!

927
01:36:36,846 --> 01:36:38,006
Something terrible's happened!

928
01:36:38,114 --> 01:36:41,447
That woman who calls herself a
vampire is trying to ruin your...

929
01:36:42,352 --> 01:36:44,786
How rude! Barging in
here without knocking!

930
01:36:45,321 --> 01:36:48,017
A woman interfering with my plans?

931
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:52,857
I will never forgive anyone who
interferes with Father's plans.

932
01:36:53,596 --> 01:36:55,188
Let's go, Nozomi, Hikaru.

933
01:36:57,333 --> 01:36:59,733
Intruder in the tower!
Intruder in the tower!

934
01:36:59,869 --> 01:37:04,238
Attention, all guards!
Execute them on sight!

935
01:37:04,374 --> 01:37:05,363
Repeat!

936
01:37:07,544 --> 01:37:08,169
Got them!

937
01:37:11,614 --> 01:37:12,581
You cover here.

938
01:37:12,782 --> 01:37:15,216
Stay in front of Seia's room.
Nobody leaves.

939
01:37:16,519 --> 01:37:19,716
I want a shot at some action.

940
01:37:20,457 --> 01:37:21,082
Who's there?

941
01:37:26,663 --> 01:37:27,721
Tatsuo...

942
01:37:30,033 --> 01:37:31,261
Tatsuo...

943
01:37:31,901 --> 01:37:33,334
Me..Megumi.

944
01:37:34,204 --> 01:37:35,603
Tatsuo.

945
01:37:35,705 --> 01:37:37,036
You poor thing.

946
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:42,043
It just began right before I got here.

947
01:37:42,746 --> 01:37:45,078
What's going to happen to me?

948
01:37:45,215 --> 01:37:47,615
H...Help..Help me, Megumi.

949
01:37:48,284 --> 01:37:48,978
I'll stop it.

950
01:37:49,719 --> 01:37:51,311
I'll help, Tatsuo.

951
01:37:52,555 --> 01:37:55,547
Only I can stop it, Tatsuo.

952
01:37:55,658 --> 01:37:56,784
Megumi.

953
01:38:08,271 --> 01:38:09,203
Where have they gone?

954
01:38:09,339 --> 01:38:10,431
Damn. Look for them.

955
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:14,204
Shit!

956
01:38:14,344 --> 01:38:17,336
Searching for Aine in this
place, it's too difficult!

957
01:38:19,549 --> 01:38:21,483
So, what are you
going to do with that?

958
01:38:25,488 --> 01:38:28,514
Are you going to make
trouble in our house?

959
01:38:28,658 --> 01:38:31,456
Master Seia said you need to be
disciplined by us!

960
01:38:31,728 --> 01:38:32,854
Right?!

961
01:38:34,631 --> 01:38:37,156
We will not be reduced to being
disciplined by ugly beasts like you!

962
01:38:45,008 --> 01:38:46,168
Wait up!

963
01:38:52,982 --> 01:38:53,641
You...

964
01:38:56,686 --> 01:38:59,086
You made the Professor kidnap my Aine.

965
01:38:59,622 --> 01:39:02,318
Not only the Professor, you vampire...
but these two as well.

966
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:07,327
No, all of the people in the world
will pledge their loyalty to me.

967
01:39:07,697 --> 01:39:08,629
What?

968
01:39:08,765 --> 01:39:11,893
I need Tatsuo's power to do so.

969
01:39:12,502 --> 01:39:13,491
Tatsuo...

970
01:39:13,636 --> 01:39:14,568
The man...

971
01:39:14,671 --> 01:39:15,296
You...

972
01:39:15,738 --> 01:39:18,832
I hate you, you monster.

973
01:39:18,975 --> 01:39:21,000
I cannot allow you to
get in my way. So...

974
01:39:25,448 --> 01:39:26,779
Who's the monster?

975
01:39:30,987 --> 01:39:31,851
What, vanished?

976
01:39:39,929 --> 01:39:42,090
Nobody is permitted to bother Seia.

977
01:39:45,101 --> 01:39:47,262
M...Megumi.

978
01:39:47,804 --> 01:39:49,396
Don't worry, Tatsuo.

979
01:39:50,206 --> 01:39:51,969
I'm going to help you.

980
01:39:52,909 --> 01:39:55,173
Tatsuo, I was born and exist....

981
01:39:57,947 --> 01:40:02,179
Only for you, Tatsuo.

982
01:40:02,886 --> 01:40:05,013
To become one with you, Tatsuo.

983
01:40:06,289 --> 01:40:10,157
So Tatsuo, give to me what is yours...
Tatsuo, please give me what is yours.

984
01:40:13,963 --> 01:40:17,490
I was surprised to hear
that you're a vampire.

985
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,295
But this is pathetic.
You'll learn your lesson.

986
01:40:19,402 --> 01:40:21,700
I'll show you what's going to
happen if you go against me.

987
01:40:21,838 --> 01:40:23,305
How stupid you are, Seia.

988
01:40:24,507 --> 01:40:26,634
You've made Mina get
really angry with you.

989
01:40:26,776 --> 01:40:30,371
Now you're gonna see Mina's true power
in your ugly face.

990
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:32,275
T..T..True power?

991
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:38,111
You can do it all by yourself
if you wish to rule the world.

992
01:40:39,222 --> 01:40:43,158
You can change into a beast
if you don't have enough power.

993
01:40:43,293 --> 01:40:44,021
But..!

994
01:40:46,963 --> 01:40:47,987
Sister!

995
01:40:48,197 --> 01:40:49,391
Hey, who are you..?

996
01:40:50,199 --> 01:40:52,292
We're Vampire Hunters!

997
01:40:52,769 --> 01:40:56,296
We will never allow you
to take the lives of others.

998
01:40:56,906 --> 01:40:58,737
When the moon burns with anger...

999
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:00,900
When the power flows through me...

1000
01:41:01,044 --> 01:41:03,535
It will be the end of
your miserable life!

1001
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:07,343
Energy overload in the tower!
Energy overload in the tower!

1002
01:41:07,483 --> 01:41:08,711
This is a red alert!

1003
01:41:08,851 --> 01:41:09,909
Evacuate the tower immediately!

1004
01:41:10,119 --> 01:41:12,781
Finally, the power will be
awakened once more...

1005
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:16,256
This wonderful event is starting.

1006
01:41:16,392 --> 01:41:18,587
A new and wonderful
world is about to begin.

1007
01:41:19,429 --> 01:41:20,794
M...Megumi...

1008
01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:22,295
I...I'm changing...

1009
01:41:22,432 --> 01:41:24,627
I...I...

1010
01:41:26,436 --> 01:41:27,130
Tatsuo...

1011
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:28,429
You're finally...

1012
01:41:32,508 --> 01:41:35,170
Seia, we're collegemates, but
I will show you no mercy!

1013
01:41:35,678 --> 01:41:36,576
How unpleasant!

1014
01:41:36,713 --> 01:41:38,613
You really are unpleasant, bitch!

1015
01:41:39,115 --> 01:41:41,982
I won't forgive you!

1016
01:41:43,052 --> 01:41:44,349
The same goes for you!

1017
01:41:45,021 --> 01:41:49,754
I shall show you the power
my father has bestowed upon me.

1018
01:41:59,469 --> 01:42:02,165
I will rip out your guts!

1019
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:10,272
Are you so stupid you think you
can kill me, Seia?

1020
01:42:10,413 --> 01:42:13,211
Do you think you are
stronger than I am? Do you?

1021
01:42:20,957 --> 01:42:22,185
Uh, oh...Here comes stupid.

1022
01:42:22,925 --> 01:42:24,017
I am not stupid.

1023
01:42:25,628 --> 01:42:27,095
How? It can't be...

1024
01:42:34,003 --> 01:42:35,766
Everyone is stupid.

1025
01:42:39,809 --> 01:42:40,503
You...

1026
01:42:40,643 --> 01:42:42,873
You've defeated
the beautiful Seia...

1027
01:42:43,012 --> 01:42:46,379
The masterpiece my father created.

1028
01:42:46,983 --> 01:42:48,917
You must apologize to me...
Apologize to Seia...

1029
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:50,085
Apologize to my father...

1030
01:42:50,887 --> 01:42:51,717
W..What?

1031
01:42:56,526 --> 01:42:59,586
FATHER!

1032
01:43:22,251 --> 01:43:23,513
What's going on? What's that?

1033
01:43:24,087 --> 01:43:25,679
Something is coming out.

1034
01:43:40,970 --> 01:43:42,028
Is that you...?

1035
01:43:42,171 --> 01:43:43,103
Tatsuo?

1036
01:43:43,806 --> 01:43:44,704
Is it you?

1037
01:43:44,874 --> 01:43:46,933
Yes, it's coming.

1038
01:43:47,076 --> 01:43:50,603
The new world order is beginning.

1039
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,345
Why...Why has it come?

1040
01:44:00,423 --> 01:44:03,290
The Beast that destroyed
our ancient home is here now!

1041
01:44:04,026 --> 01:44:05,254
Why is it here?
