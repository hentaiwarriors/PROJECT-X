1
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,640
Masao Sera, having
joined forces with...

2
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,430
the gangs
of Nightmare Campus...

3
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,900
saw their battle with the
Gods suddenly escalate...

4
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,950
and soon the entire campus
was plunged into chaos.

5
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,380
Student president
Shuichi Kusanagi...

6
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,920
having brainwashed the majority of
students into fighting the gangs...

7
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,660
forced Masao and his friends
into a deadly situation.

8
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,120
The now outcast Masao
was able to unleash...

9
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,600
the anger inside
him against the Gods.

10
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,640
Lacking this advantage,
Kusanagi tempted Yuuko Someya.

11
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,270
Although she
genuinely loves Masao...

12
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,040
she was drawn to Kusanagi
as though destined to.

13
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,150
Against her will,
Kusanagi had sex with her.

14
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,920
Meanwhile, the
captured Akira Mido...

15
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,150
learned the shocking
truth from the God Mikogami:

16
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:02,170
That the Gods had broken
the seal imprisoning the demons.

17
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,190
The revelation of the
reason behind this act...

18
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,500
was too horrible for
Akira's mind to bear.

19
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,430
And, finally, the time
for battle arrived.

20
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,480
At a campus assembly, Kusanagi
used Akira to expose Masao!

21
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,080
Masao Sera!
He is... a demon!

22
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,090
Upon hearing these words,
the brainwashed students...

23
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,460
shed the last of their humanity
and attacked Masao and his friends.

24
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,520
Once again, violence was
visited upon the campus.

25
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,800
Amidst the chaos, Kusanagi took
Yuuko, daring Masao to follow.

26
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,670
Enraged, Masao followed.
But then, before his eyes...

27
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,410
he saw Yuuko behave as a
willing partner for Kusanagi.

28
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,210
It was then that Kusanagi
revealed the shocking truth:

29
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,690
Yuuko was, in fact,
a God herself!

30
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,770
Masao managed to kill
Kusanagi with one blow...

31
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,490
but Yuuko refused
to come to him.

32
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,570
Now overwhelmed with despair,
Masao lost control of his power

33
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,970
and destroyed
everything around him.

34
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,610
The campus was closed as a
result of this incident...

35
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,250
and the growing chain
of events was broken.

36
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,910
And now, months later...

37
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,150
- Well, see you tomorrow.
- See you.

38
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,820
- Bye-bye
- Bye.

39
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,020
Prepare for data sampling.

40
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,850
Roger.

41
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,360
What are you doing?

42
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,060
This area's closed!

43
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,960
Didn't you know that?

44
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,930
S-sorry, I was just
taking a short-cut.

45
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,360
Are you a student
at Nightmare Campus?

46
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,430
N-n-no, I...

47
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,310
Have you seen the demons?

48
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,140
Or...
Are you a demon yourself?

49
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,110
Well?

50
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,020
What are you doing?

51
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,790
Help me! This man's...

52
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,450
What is it? Another demon?

53
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,460
No! Let me go! Stop it!

54
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,370
Stop it, please!
I'm not a demon!

55
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,810
Shut up!

56
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,250
You Nightmare Campus
people are all monsters!

57
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,380
Look! A guy in this home
went to your school, too.

58
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,420
He was a nice, quiet student.

59
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,460
Then it happened,
about a month after...

60
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,050
they closed the school
'cuz of that trouble they had.

61
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,520
He suddenly went nuts and
turned into some kinda animal!

62
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,490
He slaughtered his parents,
then raped and ATE his sister!

63
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,260
Kagami...

64
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,070
Oh, a friend of yours?

65
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,630
He went out after that and
killed dozens of people...

66
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,970
including eight
cops on patrol!

67
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,380
He took a chunk outta my
arm before he got away!

68
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,440
It wasn't just him, either!

69
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,710
There've been lots
of cases like that!

70
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,350
They just haven't
made it public yet.

71
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,820
Tell me!
Who are you people?

72
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,590
What are you
doing to this city?

73
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,160
Answer me!

74
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,130
Beginning data sampling.
The girl reads as normal.

75
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,140
I'm seeing D-factor influence
in the two investigators.

76
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,970
Should we get them away from...

77
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,940
the sampling subject,
Superintendent Sumeragi?

78
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,430
No, that won't be necessary.

79
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,810
Just continue
monitoring the situation.

80
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,480
Y-yes, sir.
But what about the girl?

81
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,950
I told you.
Monitor the situation.

82
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,550
Our purpose is data collection.
Is that clear, Mr. Kajiwara?

83
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,220
Roger.

84
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,070
What are you doing?
Come on!

85
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,950
Well, you sure look like
a normal woman here.

86
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,970
No! Stop it!

87
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,080
Please... Stop it, please!

88
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,310
No! No!

89
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,550
D-factor increasing
rapidly in sample subject.

90
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,280
Body temperature has
risen to 44 degrees Celsius.

91
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,790
Dopamine output increasing,
similar to samples B, H, and O.

92
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,260
Classify her as sample T.

93
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,700
Yes, sir!

94
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,740
Hell, she's really
getting into this!

95
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:08,340
A few minutes ago she was making
like the Virgin Mary, but now!

96
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,050
You're pretty tight!
It almost hurts!

97
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,730
D-factor rising! Over level E!

98
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,400
Hey!
Something weird's happening.

99
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,730
Reading a metamorphosis!
She's demonizing!

100
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,090
My...!

101
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,950
Shoot! Shoot!

102
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,470
She's crying...

103
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,480
What are we fighting?

104
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,750
Another one!
Someone just demonized!

105
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,260
Where is it, Kagami?

106
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,520
Near the campus.

107
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,060
I got it off the
scrambled police channel.

108
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,760
One cop and a lot of bystanders
are dead or injured.

109
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,430
Their target's
headed into the city.

110
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,660
What do we do?

111
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,760
We're going in.
Advance team, move out!

112
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,860
Right.

113
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,770
Martial Arts Club, move out!

114
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,270
We'll take it!

115
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,510
- Thanks.
- Right!

116
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,590
I'm going, too!
Assemble squad two!

117
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,850
Right! Let's go, you guys!

118
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,750
- What's wrong?
- The one who just demonized...

119
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,990
It's Yoko Nishima,
from section 1-F!

120
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,520
That's my section!

121
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,360
Another one of our students.

122
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,540
I don't get it...
What's going on?

123
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,550
They're really
putting on a show.

124
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,820
Well, we won't save
her by lying low.

125
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,880
Right! Guys!
Time to cut loose!

126
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,390
Sir! Everyone's here!

127
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,460
Situation?

128
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,340
It's retreated to a restaurant
on the sixth floor of that building.

129
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,840
The customers and staff
are out of there.

130
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,670
We don't have
an exact count yet...

131
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,810
but there are a lot of police
and civilian casualties.

132
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,180
We haven't been able
to get near it. Also...

133
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,510
What?

134
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,920
First platoon was wiped out.

135
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,530
Kajiwara died in action.

136
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,290
What?

137
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,500
Prepare for battle!
We're going in!

138
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,130
Hold on, Yuuki.

139
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,190
What?

140
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,800
Just have your men
surround the building.

141
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,170
What's going on?

142
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,270
My team will go in.

143
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,910
We're an extra-jurisdictional
team established outside of...

144
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,470
the police force and trained
to deal with this situation.

145
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,710
Since when?

146
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,410
Since our elite mobile
team was wiped out.

147
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,880
It was easy to convince
the Prime Minister after that.

148
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,890
You...! You set Kajiwara's
team up, didn't you?

149
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,950
Sir, don't do it!

150
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,530
Just observe the
situation, Mr. Yuuki.

151
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,630
This case threatens all mankind.

152
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,500
Shoot! Shoot it!

153
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,020
Quick! Get a sample!

154
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,690
No! No more killing!

155
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,520
Fire!

156
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,730
Okay, hit 'em hard!

157
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,940
Sir!

158
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,940
Shoot!

159
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,440
What the...?

160
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,980
They've come...

161
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,390
Sorry we took so long.

162
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,590
Good work, guys!

163
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,740
Hmpf! No sweat!

164
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,070
Don't let them go!
Concentrate fire!

165
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,750
Where are they?

166
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,100
All right, let's clear out!

167
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,740
Sir, what was that?

168
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,570
Withdraw our men.
The party's over for us.

169
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,380
Take care of the rest, okay?

170
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,780
Mr. Yuuki!

171
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,020
Those were more of our enemies.

172
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,050
Move it!

173
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,360
Get the fire trucks in here!

174
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,790
Sir!

175
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,040
Well, look at the
mess you've made!

176
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,910
I let you into my
apartment, thinking you're...

177
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,810
a decent type,
and you do this!

178
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,050
I'll make you pay for this.
Ai! Mai!

179
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,810
Right.

180
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,490
It's a little violent, but
we've gotta snap her back now.

181
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,160
Would you guys cut that out?

182
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,490
What...?
What are you doing?

183
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,500
Yoko...?

184
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,010
Don't look at me.

185
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,770
Thank goodness
you're safe, Yoko.

186
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,120
We're all your friends here.
You can relax.

187
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,520
I killed so many people...

188
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:07,560
I've turned into this monster...
I can't go on!

189
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,530
Don't say that!

190
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,070
You're wrong.

191
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,210
We have to live!

192
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,030
Yoko!

193
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,800
Come on, guys.
Get her into bed.

194
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,100
Right!

195
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,570
Okay, all men, get out!

196
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,920
No news reports
after all that happened?

197
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:22,200
But people are getting
more and more scared.

198
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,600
What are the Gods trying to do?

199
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,210
She'll be okay.
She's taking it hard...

200
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,080
but she's letting
Kagami stay with her.

201
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,240
She isn't ashamed to
let him see her now.

202
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,280
Must be really tough for her...

203
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,230
So, what's up with Yuuko?

204
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,230
She won't let me see her.

205
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,760
Is that so?

206
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,630
Aren't you avoiding
her for no reason, too?

207
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,240
You're so gloomy!
Blue balls?

208
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,970
Wanna do it with me,
like we did before?

209
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,740
If you don't do something,
you'll all go nuts.

210
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,320
You... Yuuko... Akira...

211
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,070
He spends every
waking minute doing it.

212
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,730
But he's at the end of his rope.

213
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,810
It's like he's running away from
something horrible that he knows.

214
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,740
They don't mind it.
They do whatever he wants.

215
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,750
The funny thing is...

216
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,760
Everyone's who's had sex
with him has gotten pregnant.

217
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,950
But, that's...!

218
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,760
All of them!
Is that even possible?

219
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,300
Does it mean anything?

220
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,430
Does it say what
he's so afraid of?

221
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:16,950
Tell me, Lord Esedess!
What's happening?

222
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,780
Does it mean you're
going to betray us again?

223
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,450
You...?

224
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,730
What?
What did you just say?

225
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,070
You heard me
just fine, Mr. Yuuki.

226
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,910
You and your unit are now
under my direct command.

227
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,070
The special anti-demon unit.

228
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,580
Are you people nuts?

229
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,780
Watch your mouth, Yuuki!

230
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:00,090
Naturally, the citizenry
won't be told the truth.

231
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,490
But the problem's spread outside
of Japan and across the world.

232
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,430
In Russia they had to destroy a
whole city because of the chaos.

233
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,930
Along with those things.

234
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,030
We have no effective
countermeasures here in Japan.

235
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,940
Unless we act, it's obvious
we'll end up like them.

236
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,040
But, demons?
In this day and age? That's...!

237
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,410
You've fought them several
times already, haven't you?

238
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,010
But they're originally
human beings, aren't they?

239
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,580
We don't know the cause, but...!

240
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:36,090
Mr. Yuuki, your
sentimentalism is irrelevant!

241
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,530
I told you already: This case
threatens all mankind!

242
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,860
Are you people
even human yourselves?

243
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,470
Isn't it too soon?
They're not ready.

244
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,890
The situation has changed.
We haven't much time left.

245
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,160
They'll be attacking soon?

246
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,320
Yes. We just got the
latest data from Katmandu.

247
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,990
Ironic, isn't it?

248
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,600
That in living so long we've
forgotten how to act quickly.

249
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,910
We've let too
much time slip away.

250
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,580
By the way, about that
young lady, Yuuko Someya...

251
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,080
If she becomes a liability...

252
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,050
kill her.

253
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,380
Yes, sir.

254
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,880
Masao, it's crazy!

255
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,760
If I'm not out in two hours,
come in after me.

256
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,750
Great! He did it!

257
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,150
Akira... Come back to me...

258
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,020
Otherwise, I'll...!

259
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,500
AKIRA!

260
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,420
Wake up, Akira!

261
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,120
Have some.

262
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,780
You haven't seen him?

263
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:42,300
Doctor, I... What am I?

264
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,810
I don't understand any of this.

265
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,970
If I'm really a God,
like you are...

266
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,220
then I should be
able to forget Masao.

267
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,500
You may never
be able to go back.

268
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:03,440
Not yet... I don't know
exactly what you are yet.

269
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:09,350
Our race's longevity has
harmed our ability to reproduce.

270
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:14,460
And there's no precedent for...

271
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,490
a life form like you
appearing among the humans.

272
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,560
To have done so now...

273
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:35,080
I want to see for myself!
Exactly who you are.

274
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,980
Now, awaken...
Show me your true form.

275
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,330
It can't be! You're...!

276
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,700
Akira!

277
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,870
Masao...

278
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,840
Masao, why did you wake me?
To show me hell?

279
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:51,040
So I could be destroyed
along with you, Masao?

280
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,410
What the hell is this?

281
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,860
I'm sorry,
you can't go in there.

282
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,630
Don't I have clearance?

283
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,510
I'm sorry, sir. They told me
only project staff is allowed in.

284
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,820
What the fuck?

285
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,470
What the hell
are you Gods doing?

286
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,140
Who are they?

287
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,820
What's going on?

288
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,270
Sir, big time trouble!

289
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,130
Now what?

290
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,070
The government just broke the
news on the demonization effect!

291
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,370
It's on the TV now!

292
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,940
WHAT?

293
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,510
We repeat, while it remains
unclear as to the causes...

294
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,610
or the possible treatment of
this genetic mutation effect...

295
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,420
the "Demon Plague" is highly
contagious and is spreading.

296
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,920
To prevent confusion and panic
among the city's residents...

297
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,420
the government has decided to
publicly reveal this sickness.

298
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:18,170
The Welfare Ministry is taking
this threat very seriously...

299
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,960
and is organizing the public
health authorities to cooperate.

300
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,700
Due to concern about
the disease's virulence...

301
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,710
top priority
is being given to...

302
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,900
isolating and
treating those infected.

303
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,940
That's ridiculous!
It isn't contagious!

304
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,850
While the symptoms vary,
the threat it poses...

305
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,850
to public order has
prompted the creation of...

306
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,750
a new special police unit.

307
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,160
In order to help the infected,
it has been necessary to...

308
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,890
use tranquilizer guns
to safely sedate them.

309
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,170
Hah! You mean mow us down!

310
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,170
In this exclusive footage,
we can see scenes of...

311
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,830
their first mission
to restore public order.

312
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:03,470
The victim of the disease shown
here is still unidentified.

313
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,950
If we learn anything
about who they might be...

314
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,940
A request from the government.

315
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:15,260
In order to contain the
further spread of the disease...

316
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:22,090
please contact police or
public health authorities...

317
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,470
in the event you
discover infected persons...

318
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,470
among your family,
neighbors, or co-workers.

319
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,240
The two clearest symptoms of
the disease are as follows:

320
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,150
One: A sudden increase
in physical abilities.

321
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,190
Two: Radical personality change
and emotional instability...

322
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,220
such as extreme
manic-depression.

323
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,830
Currently we're seeing
scattered rain storms...

324
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,420
clearing up tomorrow and
leaving a lovely autumn day.

325
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,660
Next up, tomorrow's forecast
for the rest of the area.

326
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,670
Tokyo, Saitama, and Kanagawa
should be clear.

327
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,240
Ibaraki and Chiba will
start off partly cloudy...

328
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,300
but clear up
by late afternoon.

329
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,810
Trouble!

330
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,850
People are demonizing all
around the campus neighborhood!

331
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,740
That weird force we felt
before must be causing it!

332
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,660
This isn't real!

333
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,830
That was good, man.

334
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,840
Lemme go! Lemme go!

335
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,880
Help me! Monsters!
Monsters! Monsters!

336
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,230
Police!

337
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,570
A-20, A-06! Confirm demon
sightings in the Motomichi area.

338
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,400
Take care of infected citizens.

339
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,340
Use standard equipment and
live guns to restore order.

340
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,180
They'll never stop this!

341
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,690
What'll we do, Masao?

342
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,720
There's one!
And another one, too!

343
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,320
What's going on here?

344
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,890
It started just after
the public announcement!

345
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,990
What do we do?

346
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,070
They're all waiting
for your word.

347
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,610
You feel the same as
we do, don't you, Sera?

348
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,760
We're the only ones
who can save them.

349
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,760
Fire!

350
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,170
Let's go!

351
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,880
Our objective is to
defuse this situation!

352
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,110
Try hard to save
the demonized people!

353
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,440
And avoid fighting at all costs!

354
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,260
Outsiders, into battle!

355
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,600
The chaos caused by
the demonization effect...

356
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,740
has caused fires
to burn out of control.

357
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,570
Doctor, what's happening?

358
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:57,040
The first step
of the Gods' plan.

359
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,840
It's only just begun.

360
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,700
It's begun!
