1
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:26,969
No!

2
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:53,522
No, stop!

3
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:56,101
Please, you've done enough!

4
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:10,007
No, Kenta!

5
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,885
Don't do it!

6
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,655
Please, don't come inside me!

7
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:23,027
Stop!

8
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:34,667
No!

9
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:42,144
No, Kenta!

10
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:46,849
No!

11
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:50,285
No!

12
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:59,393
<i>I felt this summer was going to be special.</i>

13
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:04,197
<i>I was kind of excited.</i>

14
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:07,471
<i>I thought of the good things</i>
<i>that could come true.</i>

15
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,687
Yes, this is Kotomi speaking.

16
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,054
Jinpachi!

17
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:28,455
That's fine!

18
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,229
It's time for me to wake up.

19
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:34,459
Pool?

20
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:35,865
But...

21
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:39,562
I don't think I can.

22
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:41,372
Yeah.

23
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:44,175
Kenta's coming?

24
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:48,040
I think I can make it today.

25
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,912
I'd feel bad turning down an invitation.

26
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:56,753
Yes, I'll meet you in front of the pool at 11.

27
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:06,989
I haven't seen them since
the last day of school.

28
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,278
Maybe I should wear the pink one.

29
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:26,279
Isaku Respect

30
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,449
Episode1: Prison of Shame

31
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,526
Kotomi Asakawa

32
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:57,742
Hey, Kotomi.

33
00:03:57,817 --> 00:03:59,808
What do you see in Kenta?

34
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,082
Well<i>...</i>

35
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,032
You like him, right?

36
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,333
I think you would be better off
with someone older and more mature.

37
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:26,878
It's better if...

38
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:29,946
the guy knows what he's doing,
you know.

39
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:31,645
I don't think...

40
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:34,147
I'm really ready for that yet.

41
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:37,847
Someone else will get to him first!

42
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:38,856
Competition?

43
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,524
It's obvious that Miyuki
also likes Kenta...

44
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:44,853
by the way she looks at him.

45
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,173
It's obvious that Miyuki
also likes Kenta...

46
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:59,776
by the way she looks at him.

47
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:02,141
Hi Kotomi!

48
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,611
Hi, Miyuki!

49
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:10,423
How are you?

50
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:11,990
Fine.

51
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:20,697
You didn't expect to see me here?

52
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,868
It's not that.

53
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,100
I just talked to Kenta.

54
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,375
You came with him.

55
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,942
We came with friends.

56
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:36,079
Akemi was here too, but she left.

57
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:38,579
I wasn't asking for details.

58
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,184
I wasn't implying anything.

59
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:45,324
It's really none of my business.

60
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:04,902
Liar!

61
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,545
<i>I have competition.</i>

62
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:28,327
<i>What am I doing this for?</i>

63
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:40,608
Kotomi.

64
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,212
Miyuki?

65
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,919
Don't look up my skirt!

66
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:04,632
If you're that desperate...

67
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:06,532
you can take a good look.

68
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:08,363
Ha!

69
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,842
All men should just<i>...</i>

70
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:12,610
disappear.

71
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:16,382
What!

72
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:17,108
Don't!

73
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,547
You should be a lot more careful.

74
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,385
It's not like my skirt's short on purpose!

75
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,758
I know the wealthy Princess
wants a lot of attention...

76
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,823
but it's causing problems.

77
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,297
Don't call...

78
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,728
me Princess, because I'm not.

79
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:36,932
Really, if you're not
a wealthy princess...

80
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:40,301
then why do you show off
your silk underwear?

81
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,539
<i>Is she mean to me...</i>

82
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:46,041
<i>because she likes Kenta, too?</i>

83
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:48,044
<i>If that's true...</i>

84
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:50,006
<i>then I can't lose!</i>

85
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:54,951
<i>Why am I thinking about this?</i>
<i>It's not worth it.</i>

86
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:07,792
<i>It's not like I get to make the decision,</i>
<i>any way.</i>

87
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,594
<i>Did mom leave me a note?</i>

88
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:28,946
Unbelievable!

89
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,734
I should have just ignored that
goddamned letter.

90
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:44,799
What did your letter say?

91
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,230
Was yours blackmail?

92
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:50,437
Well, same here.

93
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,744
Where did they get the info?

94
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,206
The note was filled with cheap threats.

95
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:58,515
We don't know that for sure, do we?

96
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,716
The author's skilled
at getting blackmail information.

97
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:04,952
I know it's just a prank.

98
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:08,452
They're having fun watching us
freak out in here.

99
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:10,788
I don't think that's the objective.

100
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:12,424
What do you mean?

101
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:16,427
We all have to focus
on protecting ourselves right now.

102
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:17,861
That's stupid!

103
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:21,307
Then why would they send Kenta
a note as well?

104
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,535
Maybe he's a target, too.

105
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:27,344
Miyuki, where is Kenta, anyway?

106
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:30,577
He went out to look for Ms. Kumi...

107
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,714
and Rika, since they've disappeared.

108
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:35,287
Also, a way out of here.

109
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:38,654
I think it's a little too late, but<i>...</i>

110
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:56,707
<i>It stinks in here!</i>

111
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:07,043
<i>I guess I don't have a choice.</i>

112
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,089
<i>Nobody's looking, I hope.</i>

113
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,551
I'm really sorry to barge in on you like this.

114
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:53,694
Akemi's disappeared, too.

115
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,198
What?

116
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:58,402
You, Kenta, and I are the only people left.

117
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,705
Don't wander off by yourself anymore.

118
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:04,673
Miyuki?

119
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:08,708
What do you think happened to everybody
that disappeared?

120
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:11,606
You just might find out
for yourself...

121
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:14,486
if you keep wandering off like this.

122
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:15,685
I didn't.

123
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:19,988
Kenta was totally freaking out
that you were gone.

124
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:23,626
He was worried that you disappeared
like the other girls.

125
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,191
I need you to promise me...

126
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,499
that you won't tell Kenta about...

127
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:31,537
I refuse to lie for anybody.

128
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:36,400
It's just something you don't want
a person you like to know.

129
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:40,612
I don't stoop so low
as to like men.

130
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:42,777
Period.

131
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,211
So, you don't like Kenta?

132
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:47,944
Don't worry about me.

133
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,214
Don't you know he likes you?

134
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,755
I also have to ask you to do me a favor.

135
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:06,499
I can't believe you had the guts
to use this dirty toilet!

136
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:08,869
Miyuki...

137
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:11,171
I'm keeping the door open.

138
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:16,076
That would be a lot better for me
than smelling anybody's piss.

139
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:17,576
That's rude.

140
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:22,483
Tell me, is the princess implying
that her urine smells like perfume?

141
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:25,355
You were holding it for a while.

142
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:28,524
Is that supposed to make it
smell even better?

143
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:31,696
Will you please stop calling me Princess?

144
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:35,965
It's not like I wear silk underwear
every day, either!

145
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:41,298
You don't have a sense of humor either.

146
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:45,477
Why does she enjoy making fun of me?

147
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:47,711
What?

148
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:48,606
What's wrong?

149
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:49,407
It's okay!

150
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:51,913
It's okay, I got spooked.

151
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:52,745
But...

152
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,343
I swear, I'm fine.

153
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:56,084
If you say so.

154
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,085
What was that about?

155
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:16,435
Hi!

156
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:18,000
No!

157
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:19,101
See?

158
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:20,068
Here!

159
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:21,240
Ha!

160
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:23,108
Perv!

161
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:24,345
Ha!

162
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,950
Fine, you can pick me.

163
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:31,279
You can watch. The next episode, that is.

164
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:42,398
This place is just disgusting.

165
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,466
I guess I was being too mean.

166
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:53,475
I'd rather...

167
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:55,911
not have to do this.

168
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:15,498
<i>Maybe I should tell Kotomi about it, too.</i>

169
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:18,627
No, stop it!

170
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:19,693
No!

171
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,569
<i>A video was found...</i>

172
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:55,739
<i>of the girls that disappeared,</i>
<i>being raped.</i>

173
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:59,969
<i>The psycho must be after her, too.</i>

174
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,812
No, stop!

175
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:06,576
No!

176
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:10,483
No, let me go!

177
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:52,762
<i>Should I tell her?</i>

178
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:01,267
What?

179
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:04,673
It's okay!

180
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:08,075
It's okay, I got spooked.

181
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:09,281
But...

182
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:12,178
I swear, I'm fine.

183
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:14,418
If you say so.

184
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:20,449
<i>I'm getting all worked up.</i>

185
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:35,230
I'm sorry.

186
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:38,576
Please excuse me.

187
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:40,205
Let's just<i>...</i>

188
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:42,244
forget about this, okay?

189
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:45,611
We're both old and mature enough...

190
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:49,112
to handle this like adults, right?

191
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:04,264
I will, I'll tell her, move the knife!

192
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:05,561
Keep pissing.

193
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:06,601
What?

194
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:09,240
He wants to watch you pee.

195
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,206
No, stop!

196
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:15,143
I'll say it like you want!

197
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,179
I want to watch...

198
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:18,941
you pee.

199
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:23,685
Come on...

200
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,648
keep peeing!

201
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:28,821
Please!

202
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,924
<i>For the two of us,</i>
<i>this was only the start...</i>

203
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:36,966

204
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,773
Episode 2 "Miyuki Sakaki"

205
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,812
Hi big sister!

206
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:40,893
She's really cute.

207
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:43,034
That's her only asset.

208
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:44,564
Really.

209
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,601
You have to check.

210
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:54,741
You don't want the world
to see your panties.

211
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:57,746
Thanks.

212
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:28,912
What are you doing in here?

213
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,243
So, what was that sigh all about?

214
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:36,146
Anything to do with this cute guy?

215
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:38,487
Give me that!

216
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,723
Now!

217
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:40,787
No!

218
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,519
Now!

219
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:42,719
Don't be a pain!

220
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,386
No!

221
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:45,530
Right?

222
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:46,826
Are you going to listen to me?

223
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:47,627
Nope!

224
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:49,058
Never!

225
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:51,694
Fine!

226
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:00,907
Ha!

227
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:02,811
Stop it!

228
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:04,409
No, don't!

229
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:08,312
So even you get excited
when you think about him.

230
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:11,481
Just, cut it out!

231
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:16,888
I don't think you have anything
to worry about, at all.

232
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,322
You're really pretty, too!

233
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:21,760
Wait!

234
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:25,761
You're still so frigid!

235
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:27,803
This isn't funny, Aimi!

236
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:31,041
You have to be more honest...

237
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:33,634
if you want him to notice you.

238
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:38,178
You can't get past your inhibitions.

239
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:40,051
You can be so immature.

240
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:42,211
Shut up!

241
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:47,223
Fine!

242
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,691
<i>My sister...</i>

243
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:52,790
<i>was brutally raped and murdered...</i>

244
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:56,363
<i>about a year ago...</i>

245
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:01,936
<i>inside this very building.</i>

246
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,213
I'm not twisted like you are!

247
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,978
No, stop!

248
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:17,013
Stop!

249
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,552
No!

250
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,120
Please, I'll say what you want!

251
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:22,886
No!

252
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:25,095
No, stop!

253
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:27,899
Stop!

254
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:30,263
Please, hurry up!

255
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,067
I can't do it!

256
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:36,336
I can't, if people are watching!

257
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:51,017
No, stop it!

258
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:56,355
Stop, don't hurt me!

259
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,234
You psycho!

260
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:15,677
Don't look!

261
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:22,712
Don't look.

262
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:24,450
No!

263
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:27,555
He's such a sick, twisted bastard!

264
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:30,424
That was just so gross!

265
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,457
I have to tell this to everybody!

266
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,658
No!

267
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:40,130
Especially to Kenta, right?

268
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:43,099
No, please don't tell him!

269
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:45,210
So, you lied to me!

270
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,744
You like Kenta too, right!

271
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:50,938
Did I tell you that Miyuki, like...

272
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,109
farted in front of me?

273
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:54,216
I like him!

274
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:56,047
Yes, I like him!

275
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:59,653
So please don't tell him
about any of this!

276
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,851
Promise me, Kotomi!

277
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:04,622
Don't tell anybody about this, okay?

278
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,592
Especially not to Kenta!

279
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:08,960
Miyuki...

280
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:12,032
so you did.

281
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:17,499
I like him, too.

282
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:20,338
No!

283
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:37,427
Stop it!

284
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:39,087
I'm begging you!

285
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:42,791
Please don't!

286
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:00,942
Stop!

287
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:03,117
No!

288
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:04,050
No!

289
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:15,156
No!

290
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:26,569
Don't do it!

291
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:28,608
Please, don't make me!

292
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:30,608
Don't!

293
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:35,017
Somebody, help me, please help!

294
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:40,251
I can't do that for you, I just can't!

295
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:42,318
No!

296
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:44,259
No!

297
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:49,926
No!

298
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:53,903
Please don't make me!

299
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:55,463
I just can't!

300
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,976
I just can't do it!

301
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:02,807
Kotomi!

302
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:05,811
No, don't!

303
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:12,588
Stop, I just can't!

304
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,417
<i>He has to be completely crazy!</i>

305
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:45,381
You can't...

306
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:48,154
say anything about this, right?

307
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:50,451
Let's promise each other.

308
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,566
<i>What's going to happen to us?</i>

309
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,834
Help!

310
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:00,630
Kenta!

311
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:02,065
Help us!
