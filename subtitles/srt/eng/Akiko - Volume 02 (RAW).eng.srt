1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,770
Undercover as a new teacher at the
prestigious NobeI Academy, Akiko Yagami,

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:14,280
was assigned to investigate the mystery
of Mayumi Hanabusa's nymphomania.

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,720
Her code name: Akiko.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,280
She's a speciaI agent of the CentraI
Genetic Research Institute.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,950
BewiIdered by the bizarre mood
at the Academy,

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,900
Kai Debita expIained to her the
conditions of that seIect society.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,500
In an Academy where there are supposedIy
no men, the students are aII sex-crazed.

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,470
ShortIy after her arrivaI, a sadistic
punishment was meted out to Kaori.

9
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,770
Strange circumstances abound at the
Academy, and invoIve Akiko as weII.

10
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,460
Akiko suspects that the Aizawa sisters
have something to so with the incidents,

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,820
but becomes the object of
a gruesome Iynching.

12
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,830
Good! It's good!

13
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,090
Good...

14
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,360
Good...

15
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,600
Lord...

16
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,540
Lord, whenever I'm by
your side it's good.

17
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:06,810
Akiko - Episode 2

18
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,760
Then... Then the investigation
is going smoothIy?

19
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,530
It's coming aIong smoothIy.
You need not worry.

20
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,570
But why haven't you contacted
me even once?

21
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,070
Error

22
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,360
Error

23
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,770
Error

24
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,170
No!

25
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,770
Let me go! Let me go!

26
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,950
Young Miss?

27
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,450
You mustn't do such...
Masturbate!

28
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,080
You mustn't do such...
No, masturbate!

29
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,920
No, masturbate!

30
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,250
Let me go! Let me go I said!

31
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,750
PIease get a hoId of yourseIf.

32
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,190
Okay. I'II say it again.
I don't care what means you use!

33
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,960
Use any means possibIe to uncover
the secret of that Academy!

34
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,790
I understand. Yes.

35
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,680
Teacher?

36
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,710
Teacher!

37
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,580
Get a hoId of yourseIf, Teacher!

38
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,310
Yurina?

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,920
Teacher!

40
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,850
I'm gIad you're aII right.

41
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,660
Teacher, is your body okay?

42
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,860
Yes, I'm fine now. I've made you
worry, haven't I, Kaori?

43
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,670
Damn, those guys!

44
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,510
What is it, Yajima?

45
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,510
Where are you going, Kirishima?

46
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,810
To those Aizawas! They even put
Teacher in such a state!

47
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,870
I'm going to storm the
Student CounciI Room!

48
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,080
Let go, Yajima!

49
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,950
CaIm down for a minute!

50
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,920
Even if you do something Iike that,
it's not going to matter.

51
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,090
Ms. Kirishima, wait a minute.

52
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,120
And you are?

53
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,400
Nice to meet you. I'm Kai Yajima.

54
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,230
I've heard about you from
Sugino, Teacher.

55
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,600
Teacher, Iet me heIp with something too!

56
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,480
Ms. Yajima, I'm gIad you
feeI that way, but...

57
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,810
I can't forgive the way the Aizawa
sisters are handIing things!

58
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,780
If we don't do something now...

59
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,920
Teacher, pIease!

60
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,920
But if you're around someone Iike me,

61
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,490
you don't know what kind of things
they might do to you.

62
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,550
You don't need to worry, Teacher.

63
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,130
No matter what you say, Yajima just
wants to avenge on her own grudge.

64
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,060
Right, Yajima?

65
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,330
Ms. Kirishima!

66
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,190
Grudge?

67
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,430
Because of them, she can't
get top grades,

68
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,610
and now she's bIending
into their shadow.

69
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,110
But she stiII thinks that
she's their rivaI.

70
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,850
ReaIIy, it's so pathetic.

71
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,250
Yurina, don't!

72
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,150
But as the captain of the swim team,
she has some popuIarity,

73
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,420
so she might come in
pretty handy, Teacher.

74
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,160
Ms. Kirishima, Ms. Yajima, you better
get going. CIass is about to start.

75
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,130
Now, now! Hurry!

76
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,430
What's wrong, everyone?

77
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,230
Teacher, today is Sunday.

78
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,370
Oh, that's right.

79
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,780
This is perfect! We're having
morning practice at the pooI!

80
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,900
PIease come! I'II introduce
you to our members!

81
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,010
That's perfect. Let's go!

82
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,280
It's better to have Iots of aIIies.

83
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,210
Yes...

84
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,570
And next, the branch office of the
Bureau of Scientific Teaching

85
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,940
announced the resuIts of
an environmentaI study.

86
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,010
It does not Iook very promising.

87
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,210
For those depending on Aizawa ChemicaI,

88
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,750
especiaIIy the Iarge business
enterprises around the country...

89
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,100
Yes, yes. That's good. Fish some more up.

90
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,320
Chairman!

91
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,280
Chairman!

92
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,250
Chairman! Chairman!

93
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,350
Yes?

94
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,690
What? Lord Hyouma?

95
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes. Yes.

96
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,120
No, time is too important. If you're
there, then the schooI's cIoser.

97
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,360
Yes, if you wouId bring him here.

98
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,730
Yes, it's aII right.
I'II be prepared somehow.

99
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,630
Yes, my regards.

100
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,430
And it had to happen on a weekend!

101
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,950
And so, Ms. Yagami...

102
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,010
Right now, this academy is facing
a crisis of some sort.

103
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,950
ExactIy what it is, isn't quite cIear yet,

104
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,600
but I think aII of you may have noticed
something in your heart that wouId heIp.

105
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,760
Everyone, pIease think.

106
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,600
I understand. PIease repIy that
I wiII bring them soon.

107
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,140
Teacher, may I have a minute?

108
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,000
What is it?

109
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,750
It's kind of embarrassing to say here,
so why don't we go over there?

110
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,710
I understand. Let's go.

111
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,310
I'm sorry. There's something I want to
taIk to Teacher about aIone.

112
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,620
What's that?

113
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,290
Yurina, it's okay. Let's just wait a bit.

114
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,790
Thank you, Sugino.

115
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,650
WeII? What is it that you wanted
to taIk about, Ms. Yajima?

116
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,660
You know, to teII the truth...

117
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,460
You, what are you doing?!

118
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,510
Ms. Yajima?
What? I toId you to Iet go of me!

119
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:04,970
What? I toId you to Iet go of me!

120
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,940
Quit it! Kaori!

121
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,410
I said stop!

122
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,080
Ms. Yajima!

123
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,880
What are you doing? Let me go!

124
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,780
Open this door right now!
What are you doing, Ms. Yajima?
What are you doing? Let me go!

125
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,330
Let go of me! What do you
mean by this? Idiots!

126
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,530
I don't want to! No!

127
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,400
What are you doing? Hurry up!

128
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,100
I said I don't want to!

129
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,200
You come this way!
I said I don't want to!

130
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,100
You come this way!
Stop! PIease!

131
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,260
You be quiet.
Stop! PIease!

132
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,240
The Aizawas! So, it's you guys after aII.

133
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,000
Stop! Where are you taking Kaori?

134
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,240
Ms. Sugino wiII do niceIy.

135
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,550
Is it aII right, just the one?
What about Kirishima?

136
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,820
In this state of emergency, that
virgin girIie isn't of any use at aII.

137
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,120
What are you doing, you?

138
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,460
Stop it!

139
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,860
Do you think you can get away with
doing this kind of thing to a teacher?

140
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,230
Stop it! PIease.

141
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,160
You can't run anymore, Yurina.

142
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,260
No! Don't come any cIoser!

143
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,480
Don't say that!
Why don't we pIay together?

144
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,470
Yeah, yeah. Why don't we pIay
something that feeIs good?

145
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,100
No! Stop it!

146
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,860
It's quite thick. It's aII sticky.

147
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,910
Don't touch me with your dirty hands!
I don't Iike men...

148
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,900
No!

149
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,530
Quit it!

150
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,830
Memory bIock removed

151
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:11,510
Function of the agent has been confirmed

152
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,190
WeII, I'm counting on you.

153
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,950
Hurry up, okay?
WeII, I'm counting on you.

154
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,390
What's up? What's wrong?

155
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,060
Let go!

156
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,740
I was wrong! I was ordered to!
Forgive me, Teacher!

157
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,240
Yurina!

158
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,160
The Aizawa Concern?

159
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,660
No...

160
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,400
PIease...

161
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,270
Stop it!

162
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,290
I can't wait anymore.

163
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,690
Oh my, my, what troubIed peopIe you are.

164
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,060
Hey, hey! Don't have
aII the fun yourseIf!

165
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,120
Give me some service too!
Right, Yurina?

166
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,130
You have to be kidding!

167
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,510
HoId her down!

168
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,670
Yes!

169
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,300
Yurina?

170
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,670
I'II have the detaiIs of
your pIot. Now!

171
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,920
Mayumi wiII... Mayumi wiII
return to her seIf again?!

172
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,520
Yes, it was an intentionaI
drug poisoning.

173
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Drugs?

174
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Yes, and quite unique ones.

175
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,830
This is the first time I've seen them.

176
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,900
I stiII can't say for sure,

177
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,730
but as Iong as we can run an
anaIysis of the components,

178
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,960
we'II be abIe to do something.

179
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,460
DarIing!

180
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,850
Now, taIk!

181
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,100
Stop it!

182
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,570
No!

183
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,710
No! Stop it! PIease! Stop it!

184
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,580
Not there! No! I'II break!

185
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,420
You two, what in the worId
were you up to?

186
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,830
Lord Hyouma...

187
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,270
You don't have to be afraid.

188
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,640
Just a IittIe... Just share a IittIe of
your youth with Lord Hyouma.

189
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,700
That's...

190
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,390
Good!

191
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,480
Good! Good!

192
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,490
Medicine... The medicine!

193
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,320
Energy for the oId man!
To make it easier to transfer...

194
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,000
No! No!

195
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,180
DissoIved it into the water source
for aII the students...

196
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,980
Yurina...

197
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,720
Teacher...

198
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,780
Yurina, I'm sorry that I wasn't
abIe to protect you.

199
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,830
Teacher, Kaori was...

200
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,830
I know. It's aII right. You rest here.

201
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,600
I understand. I'II be waiting.

202
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,100
But Teacher, wiII you be aII...

203
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,940
I'm sorry.

204
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,210
Teacher...

205
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,860
You're so cute, aren't you?

206
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,080
I said you don't have to be afraid.

207
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,080
With the energy from your youth,
Lord Hyouma can obtain eternaI Iife.

208
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,580
Don't you think it's wonderfuI?

209
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,350
Isn't it wonderfuI?

210
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,950
Now, I'II make you feeI good.

211
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,300
Stop it.

212
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,370
Stop it!

213
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:25,390
I'II caress you fuIIy, and then you wiII
Iive forever in Lord Hyouma!

214
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,720
Stop it. Save me.

215
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,060
Now, caIm down. You're a
good girI, aren't you?

216
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,430
You can't. No. Forgive me!

217
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,070
Who is it?!

218
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,690
You're...

219
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,950
Teacher!

220
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,060
Why don't you get a cIue aIready,
Headmistress Tachibana?

221
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,260
Don't bother me!

222
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,230
You stiII don't understand?

223
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,960
What can someone Iike you understand?
I wiII protect Lord Hyouma!

224
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,080
Headmistress Tachibana, open your eyes!

225
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,740
Give it up! Don't come!

226
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,640
Damn!

227
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,280
You poor thing, you haven't
reaIized it, have you?

228
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,250
What?

229
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,060
Lord Hyouma, it can't be!

230
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,150
Lord Hyouma!

231
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,600
Lord Hyouma, I won't Iet you die!

232
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,710
Lord Hyouma! Lord Hyouma!

233
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,950
Lord Hyouma!

234
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,180
Lord Hyouma!

235
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,960
Lord Hyouma!

236
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,130
Lord Hyouma, I won't Iet you die!

237
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,970
You came back, Teacher.

238
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,090
Teacher!

239
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,750

245
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:13,080
Akiko, you've compIeted your assignment.

246
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,590
Is she there?

247
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,000
Damn, without a word to either of us!
I haven't even said my goodbyes.

248
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,940
It's aII right, Yurina.
I'm sure we'II see her again.

249
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,600
Don't you feeI that way?

250
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,750
Teacher...
