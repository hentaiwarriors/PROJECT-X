1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:10,237
Welcome to the world of Virtuacall.
We've created it just for you.

2
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:15,437
Virtual Reality!
Enjoy it to your heart's content!

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,652
I'm Wendy, the operator.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,122
Ask me anything, okay?

5
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:26,259
From here on out, everything depends only
on your charm and determination.

6
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,796
Put your heart into it, and
win wonderful love!

7
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,755
So I'll pray for your health, and...

8
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,204
Virtuacall 2,

9
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,539
Access 1.

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,736
Welcome to the World of Virtuacall

11
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,531
So everyone, please have a
pleasant summer vacation.

12
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,102
All rise!

13
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,641
Bow!

14
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:36,887
Emily!

15
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,633
I'm going to buy a patch on my way home.
Want to come along?

16
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:46,327
Sorry, I've got a prior appointment.

17
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,671
You're going to play with your
big brother again?

18
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,614
I volunteered.

19
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,250
After all, since he has tickets
to a live concert,

20
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,520
it'd be sad if there were no one
to go with him.

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,322
Well, bye-bye!

22
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,984
Hitomi, see you later!

23
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,827
That's what she says, but she's
having fun anyway.

24
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,151
Hot!

25
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,225
Emily, what are you doing?!

26
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:50,603
It's your fourth year of college, and
you're sleeping without a care?

27
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,872
What are you planning to do about
your first job next year?

28
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,602
You still haven't got even one
call back yet, have you?

29
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,478
No matter how much you worry, it's not
going to change a thing, right?

30
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,215
It just isn't in my character, you know?

31
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,684
That "Given enough shots, even a
poor shot will hit the target" thing

32
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,652
just doesn't work for me.

33
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:12,818
Really! Brother, you've got no
aptitude in these areas.

34
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,261
You're being awfully cheeky today.

35
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,097
As a relation of the landlord,

36
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:22,056
I am concerned about the future of
a tenant with no prospects.

37
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:27,035
Anyway, hurry up and get ready.
The concert will be starting soon.

38
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:33,201
I'll wait for you, so hurry up.
You're always such a pain, Brother!

39
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,854
Oh, that surprised me!

40
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,990
You really suck at this. But try harder.

41
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,091
But...

42
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,217
Don't give up!

43
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:50,396
The concert was good, wasn't it?
Let's go again sometime, Brother.

44
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,799
Besides since it's summer vacation
you have a lot of free time,

45
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,528
and you don't even have
anyone to date, right?

46
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,869
None of your business!

47
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:00,828
Besides, don't you have to go see
your parents in Los Angeles?

48
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,409
You haven't shown your face there
in about a year, right?

49
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,313
Yeah, but you know, they're always
flying off somewhere on assignment.

50
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,716
Even if I go, I'll only be in the way.

51
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:15,279
Really? It must be hard being a parent and
a newspaper's special correspondent.

52
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,324
Yeah, kind of.

53
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,986
Wait, Brother!

54
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,664
Hello?

55
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,633
Brother, are you asleep?

56
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:05,972
Geez, it's you. What are you thinking?
It's three in the morning!

57
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,741
You know I can't stand thunder!

58
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,344
Grandpa and Grandma are on vacation
with the Old Folks Association,

59
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,780
and they won't be home until
next week, and...

60
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,044
Please, don't hang up!

61
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,023
Hello? Hello?

62
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,686
Brother, hello?! Are you listening?
HELLO!

63
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,464
Brother?

64
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,935
Brother, you came after all!

65
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,923
I only have two weeks, Majhana?

66
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:15,472
Let me think about this for a while.
Please, let me have some time.

67
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,485
What is it?

68
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,657
I have a keen sense of smell.

69
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:36,094
My nose responds quickly to
a cute girl like you.

70
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,364
I'm in a hurry, so...

71
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,827
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,569
Field House

73
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,236
This is unexpected!

74
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,771
Is that kind of manly-girl your type, Brother?

75
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,505
Emily, why are you here?

76
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,580
A clumsy man's secret love!

77
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,679
Oh, I could just cry!

78
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,378
It's not really like that with her.

79
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,889
Hasegawa?

80
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,989
Oh damn!

81
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,755
Suzune...

82
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,436
Is that your girlfriend, Hasegawa?
She's cute, isn't she?

83
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,639
Oh no, you're wrong! Wrong!
This one's not like that!

84
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,539
They call me Emily!

85
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,579
My brother is always in your debt!

86
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,638
Idiot, don't say stupid things!

87
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,684
Well, Suzune, excuse us,
we'll be leaving now!

88
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,085
Thanks!

89
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,575
Bye!

90
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,968
That's good. You do have a girlfriend.

91
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,027
How long have you been with her, Brother?

92
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,764
Not yet.

93
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:31,611
I met her three years ago in the spring
at the commencement ceremony.

94
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,515
But she's cute, and her skill with the
long spear is on a national level.

95
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,474
It's stupid for someone like me to even
think about her being my girlfriend.

96
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:45,419
And, like just now, I get nervous, and
can't really talk when I'm around her.

97
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,392
That's not true!

98
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,597
Since I only have two weeks,
I have to work fast.

99
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,862
Brother, you can't do anything
without me, can you?

100
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,736
Two weeks?

101
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,237
What do you mean?

102
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,773
It's okay. I'll do something
about it for you!

103
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,139
I'll grant your wish, Brother!

104
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,411
Hey, Emily!

105
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,778
Leave it to me! See you!

106
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,042
What's got her in such a dither?

107
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,326
You're Kunihiko's Cupid?

108
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,784
Yes! So I want you to help too.

109
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:28,224
But Emily, don't you like Kunihiko?

110
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,099
Me? Brother?

111
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,703
Listen, to me that guy is like a
troublesome older brother!

112
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,015
Your naivetÃ© is kind of scary, you know?

113
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,783
Geez! Don't make such weird
assumptions, okay?

114
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,813
Emily?

115
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,161
You have VHG at your house, right, Emily?

116
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,662
I do.

117
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,061
But what's this?

118
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,631
It's all the rage on the streets, a
Virtuacall Common Use Modem.

119
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,372
If you set this up, you can play in
virtual reality just like a video game,

120
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,641
but you can really feel it.

121
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,343
It's been THE thing lately.

122
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,746
Why don't you have Kunihiko get
used to girls with this?

123
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,481
Virtuacall?

124
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:19,076
But can Brother talk about things
he doesn't know anything about?

125
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,853
It's okay!

126
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,617
I'll have everything ready on my side!

127
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:38,464
If that leave falls, then the light of
my life will also disappear.

128
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,618
How fleeting a person's wishes are.

129
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:56,756
Sayoko, it's amazing how you can act so
miserable when all you have is fatigue,

130
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,214
because you were out too late at night!

131
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,561
Oh, it's you, Hitomi.

132
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:06,065
But no one will even come visit me.

133
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,057
There's nothing else to do but daydream!

134
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,264
I expected as much, so I
brought this for you!

135
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,832
The ultimate toy!

136
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:28,650
You have to be kidding! Why do I have to
let you meddle in my life?

137
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,491
You like her enough to become a rock
when she's in front of you, right?

138
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,654
Do you mean to keep quiet like this
until you graduate?

139
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,797
It has nothing to do with you.

140
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,765
That's okay! That's okay!

141
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,701
Put this on!

142
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,703
Hey, what're you doing?

143
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,671
Okay, Brother?

144
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,171
When a girl named "Sayoko" comes up,
you have to access that girl, okay?

145
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,544
Hey, Emily?

146
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,776
I've told Sayoko about you,
Big Brother, so...

147
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,358
Hi, welcome to Virtuacall!

148
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,462
From here on out, everything depends only
on your charm and determination.

149
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,090
Put your heart into it, and
win wonderful love!

150
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,038
Sayoko...

151
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,807
The progress of technology is amazing.

152
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,285
Virtual reality has come this far?

153
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:38,154
Sayoko, I'm sorry to involve you
in Emily's evil schemes.

154
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,226
It's all right.

155
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,595
I'm just a little nervous about
being alone with a guy.

156
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,696
Sorry, I didn't think you
could feel things too!

157
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,073
Hitomi told me that right now
your love is one-sided,

158
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,668
that you can't confess your love, and
you're worried about it, Hasegawa.

159
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:03,516
I've been sickly since I was little,
and now I'm hospitalized too.

160
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:08,220
When I listen to the other girls'
conversations, it all seems so fun.

161
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,884
But I don't know anything about guys, so...

162
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,525
Please keep this a secret from
Emily and Hitomi, okay?

163
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:21,422
I was thinking that since Virtuacall
is a fabricated world,

164
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,370
if it was Kunihiko...

165
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,531
Am I not good enough?

166
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,175
That's not true. You're cute.

167
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,646
Sayoko...

168
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,623
Kunihiko...

169
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,060
No!

170
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,230
Sorry! I just...

171
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,105
Sayoko!

172
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,106
Please...

173
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,552
Wow, it's so...

174
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:27,058
Good! It's good.

175
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:59,061
To think that you can feel so much
in a made up reality.

176
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,082
Good! It's good!

177
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,583
I can feel it!

178
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,901
I'm going to come!

179
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,871
Hey, Sayoko, are you okay?

180
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,149
Wow, it's been a while!

181
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,550
It felt so good!

182
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,961
All the way?!

183
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,739
Who said you should go that far?!

184
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,297
Can't breathe...

185
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,912
Hey...

186
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,017
Hey, Emily.

187
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,154
Isn't it expensive here?

188
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,056
It's okay. Just leave it to me!

189
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,027
You need clothes that don't hurt the eyes
when you stand next to Suzune!

190
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,995
I'll coordinate!

191
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,598
Emily, don't talk so loud!

192
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,138
Brother, I don't have time.
Pretty soon, I...

193
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,936
Pretty soon, I won't be here.

194
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,045
According to the customs of
our country, Welfenland,

195
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:58,684
you have been schooled outside of the
country until your eighteenth birthday.

196
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,921
I have come to Japan to help prepare
you for your return home.

197
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:08,694
My Lady, you are our country's only
eligible heir to the throne.

198
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:13,256
The people are longing for your return
from the bottom of their hearts.

199
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,300
Oh, Hasegawa?

200
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:23,936
Good afternoon!

201
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,937
Suzune!

202
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,910
Aren't you Emily? So we meet again.

203
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:31,973
Hi.

204
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,920
What are you doing?
Isn't this your chance?

205
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,057
Well...

206
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,124
Yes?

207
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,887
It's hot today, isn't it?

208
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,887
Yes.

209
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,663
Oh, it was you after all, young lady!

210
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,303
Sorry to keep you waiting, Suzune.

211
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,006
Well, shall we go, Suzune?

212
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,703
Brother, are you all right?

213
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,084
I'm okay. Okay!

214
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,450
It doesn't matter at all!

215
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,313
I need to go somewhere, so you
go on home, first! See you!

216
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,189
See you!

217
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,192
Brother...

218
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,417
That must be him.

219
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,850
Really? Some other guy got there
before him?

220
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:50,484
Since I tried to get his spirits up,
he's been even more depressed.

221
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,965
In that case, why don't you
go out with him, Emily?

222
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,169
A woman is the best cure for a heartache
caused by another woman!

223
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:02,207
Geez! I've told you so many times!
Brother and I aren't like that!

224
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,572
So you say.

225
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,779
Maybe it's that you haven't realized
your true feelings about him yet.

226
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,782
From a brotherly presence to a lover!

227
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,250
That kind of thing happens a lot.

228
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:17,310
What?! I'm asking for you help,
and you aren't being serious.

229
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,859
Beside, even if I did, there's no time left.

230
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,409
Hello?

231
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,639
Hello? It's me.

232
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,747
What is it?

233
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,511
I wondered what you were doing, Brother?

234
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,319
You don't sound well.

235
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,288
Not really. I'm the same as usual.

236
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:58,030
Hey, what's Virtuacall like?

237
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,990
I want to do it once too! I think I'll
try it now! Do it with me, Brother!

238
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,799
I really don't feel like doing that right now.

239
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:08,674
Oh, really?!

240
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,376
If some weird guy says something
perverted to me,

241
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,512
or something scary happens to me,
you don't care?!

242
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,281
If I become damaged goods, then I won't
want to live anymore, okay?!

243
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,739
I get it already! You want me to come
with you, right?! Right?!

244
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:25,090
There's no sense in doing
Virtuacall with you, Emily.

245
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,557
We live in the same condos.

246
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,293
Really!

247
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,535
Hi, welcome to Virtuacall!

248
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,705
From here on out, everything depends only
on your charm and determination.

249
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,674
Put your heart into it, and
win wonderful love!

250
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,847
Suzune!

251
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,687
Hasegawa!

252
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,689
Suzune, why are you so drunk?

253
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:04,994
So, you access Virtuacall too, Hasegawa?

254
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,469
Brother, where are you?

255
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,415
Miss, I have a keen sense of smell.

256
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,078
My nose responds quickly to
a cute girl like you.

257
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,746
No way!

258
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,423
This smell...

259
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,483
Have we met somewhere before, young lady?

260
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,262
Mizushima framed me so easily!

261
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:47,395
It seems he bet with his friends
he could do it with me.

262
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,332
Suzune...

263
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:55,503
Don't pretend that you're worried about me.
Guys are all the same.

264
00:21:56,248 --> 00:22:00,485
And since we've met in Virtuacall,
let's have some fun together.

265
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,122
Her freshman year, the girl I like had
another girl confess her love for her.

266
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,851
She was surprised.

267
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,060
The summer of the second year,

268
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,518
she was commended for capturing
a pervert in the subway.

269
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,231
In the fall of the third year,

270
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,535
she began leaving notes for the girls
that confessed their love for her.

271
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,003
Hasegawa, I...

272
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,830
I've been watching you for
three whole years.

273
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,070
I... Hasegawa...

274
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,707
I can't do this. I feel sick!

275
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,249
Hold on, Suzune!

276
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,323
Brother, what were you doing?

277
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,727
Sorry, Emily, Suzune's in trouble.

278
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,594
Suzune?

279
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,084
I have to go!

280
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:47,593
Brother...

281
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,786
It's all right now.

282
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,468
He's so late.

283
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,921
Three years ago, Brother moved
into these condos.

284
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,925
I was separated from my family,
so I was really happy.

285
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,894
It seemed like I had a big brother.

286
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:53,131
At first I was a little shy, but
we soon became close,

287
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,589
and he played with me as though
I was his real little sister.

288
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,696
How are you feeling?

289
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,857
Thank you, I'm okay now.

290
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,902
Well then, I'll go home.

291
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,062
Wait.

292
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,772
Today, please stay by my side.

293
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,970
Suzune?

294
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,536
Nice!

295
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,907
That's good.

296
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,108
I...

297
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,343
It's good. It's good!

298
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,709
Good. Good.

299
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,342
I can't wait anymore!

300
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,916
Why does it bug me so much?

301
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,470
43th National Championship

302
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,668
Winner: Suzune Tenohji

303
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,845
What is this bad feeling in my chest?

304
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,154
Brother...

305
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,898
Before the day breaks

306
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,567
Even the moon sleeps

307
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,899
We passed through town in the car

308
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,705
A big bag

309
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,507
Is what you are carrying

310
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,977
The vision of you runs before my eyes

311
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,779
Sleepy, still a child

312
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,514
Hey, look

313
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,812
The fairy of winter

314
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,753
Is coming down in front of us

315
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,454
As if to guide us

316
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:40,125
The fairy lights the way, navigation

317
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,495
It's not on a map

318
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,131
Only ours

319
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,566
There's a side road

320
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:52,137
We'll be the first to fly out

321
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,972
So let's begin

322
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,774
The white shower

323
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,509
Of our breath

324
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,077
Again in the sky

325
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,945
Can become snow

326
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,747
For a long time, for a long time

327
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,051
Let's put our footprints in the snow

328
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,986
I can tell you

329
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,721
Gently, now

330
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:13,024
At the moment the sun begins to rise

331
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,926
Now, once again

332
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,594
Strongly, strongly

333
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,064
As you hold me close

334
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,964
I need you

335
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:52,886
Next Episode

336
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,030
Lady Emily has finally realized she's in love,

337
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,598
but it's going nowhere.

338
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:04,169
As for Kunihiko, he's wandering
this way and that.

339
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,538
Be honest and acknowledge your feelings.

340
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:09,274
And take those feelings and
go for it with Kunihiko!

341
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,776
Are you going to go back to
the Kingdom of Welfenland

342
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,611
with only memories of Japan?

343
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,446
You're almost out of time.

344
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,744
Lady Emily, good luck!
