1
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:42,169
To Narita From Shinobu

2
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:13,166
Dear Narita...

3
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:36,218
The Sorceress

4
00:03:45,302 --> 00:03:48,635
Hoshino

5
00:04:34,118 --> 00:04:35,210
Narita...

6
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,066
Mika! Where are you going
at this time of night?

7
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:35,611
To college for a bit.

8
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,703
You've got to be kidding!

9
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:40,342
A proper woman doesn't
go carousing at night.

10
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:43,451
What are you talking about?
I won't be long.

11
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:44,545
Mika!

12
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:47,355
What'll I do with her?

13
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,387
Who talks about being
a "proper woman" these days?

14
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:59,845
Mika!

15
00:08:03,593 --> 00:08:08,155
Hurry and come to breakfast
or you'll be late for college.

16
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:09,290
Goodness!

17
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,403
Mika. What on earth...?

18
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:24,675
What happened last night?

19
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,841
I don't want any breakfast.

20
00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:31,920
Mika. What on earth's gotten into you?

21
00:08:37,594 --> 00:08:39,824
Are you hanging around
with a bad crowd?

22
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:52,368
Good morning...

23
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:59,044
Enoshima College

24
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:16,932
That's Hoshino, isn't it?

25
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:17,956
Yeah.

26
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:29,509
Hey, you!

27
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:37,977
You're Hoshino, a freshman, right?

28
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:40,854
What's with all the makeup?
And that lipstick!

29
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:47,256
How dare you look at me
with such defiance!

30
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:51,727
It's none of your business.
Now move.

31
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:53,193
Pardon?!

32
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:56,205
I said move.

33
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:19,918
I'll devour you.

34
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:47,621
Stand! Bow! Be seated!

35
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:56,529
Lunch time!

36
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:12,773
Let's hurry and go
to the cafeteria, Mika!

37
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:17,654
What's wrong? We should hurry.

38
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:18,621
Not hungry.

39
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,622
What?

40
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:30,425
I'll wait for you in the cafeteria.

41
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:29,619
Nobody else is here yet.

42
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:35,730
This is great! Glad I came early!

43
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:40,001
What's that?

44
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:46,107
Here goes!

45
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:06,952
Mika.

46
00:13:12,802 --> 00:13:14,770
What's the matter, Shinobu?

47
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:18,263
I saw something weird in the pool.

48
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:20,603
Really? Shinobu.

49
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:22,703
I'll show you something
really interesting.

50
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,644
What?

51
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:26,576
Now, come closer.

52
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:41,063
What is it, Mika?
I'm scared!

53
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:49,332
What's going on, Mika?

54
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:57,646
I won't forgive you!

55
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:15,862
No! No!

56
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:11,750
Hey, what is that?

57
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,108
Think it's another replinoid, Iijima?

58
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:40,176
Yeah, definitely.

59
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:44,252
She was such a cute woman. The beast!

60
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:47,552
Whose body is it going to devour next?

61
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:49,591
There is a witness.

62
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:50,854
Where?!

63
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:55,295
A student was drawing by
the pool at about the same time.

64
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:57,265
She saw somebody running by.

65
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:05,703
Is that right?

66
00:16:06,276 --> 00:16:09,211
Let's go talk to her.

67
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:17,682
Quit staring, idiot!

68
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:32,567
Fine Arts Club

69
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:40,200
Yeah, I saw her. Just before
class this morning.

70
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:42,268
Did you see her face?

71
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,480
It was very brief.

72
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:47,813
I just glimpsed her profile.

73
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:49,876
Anyway, what's it to you?

74
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,218
I've already told the police everything.

75
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:56,748
I don't have anything
more to tell you two.

76
00:16:56,793 --> 00:17:00,229
What a terrible morning this has been.

77
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:02,688
Take a look at this woman.

78
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:11,199
Yeah, what about her?

79
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:14,944
Her hair was wet.

80
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:16,935
Her hair was wet.

81
00:17:17,013 --> 00:17:21,177
She was going the same way
as the woman you saw.

82
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:25,187
Did she look like this woman?

83
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:31,358
I was sketching when
I heard a woman's scream.

84
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:33,294
I turned to look in that direction.

85
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:46,199
That's not her.
A student would wear a white blouse.

86
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:49,143
The woman I saw was wearing bright red.

87
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,671
She was wearing red?

88
00:17:51,714 --> 00:17:54,410
Come on, a criminal wouldn't
dress so conspicuously.

89
00:17:55,051 --> 00:18:00,956
Whatever. But I study art,
and I never mistake a color!

90
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:05,353
You've asked enough questions,
now how about leaving me alone?

91
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,655
Why red clothes?

92
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:44,861
She's not a firewoman.
Red... red... red...

93
00:19:01,384 --> 00:19:03,682
A red shirt.

94
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,227
On Sale Now!

95
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:36,177
That's enough for today. I'm going home.

96
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:47,126
That's strange. I'm sure it was closed.

97
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:28,801
This red bathing suit
sure is something else!

98
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:32,672
Bet she's going to take it off soon!

99
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,806
Narita! What are you looking at?

100
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,984
Iijima! What are you wearing that for?!

101
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,920
What do you mean?
What's wrong with my outfit?

102
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,190
Oh, it's a white tank top.

103
00:20:56,399 --> 00:21:00,358
Too bad. Just an afterimage.

104
00:21:33,302 --> 00:21:36,931
Iijima! It was an afterimage!

105
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,900
Hoshino was the killer after all!
Let's get back to college!

106
00:21:45,214 --> 00:21:46,112
Wait!

107
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:04,256
What was that?

108
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:05,453
Oh no!

109
00:23:41,264 --> 00:23:42,822
How did you figure it out?

110
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:45,493
I was too late, Iijima.

111
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:48,264
If only I'd figured it out
a little sooner.

112
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,177
Narita.

113
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:13,590
How'd you know that
Hoshino was the killer?

114
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:16,694
It was an afterimage.

115
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:18,529
What do you mean, "afterimage"?

116
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:22,395
Like when you stare at
something yellow...

117
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:24,407
...then look away at something white.

118
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:26,705
For an instant, it appears blue.

119
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:28,437
The other day...

120
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,139
Saiki was drawing trees,
and constantly looking at green.

121
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,279
Suddenly she looked up
to see something white.

122
00:24:43,392 --> 00:24:46,725
She only saw for an instant,
so she mistook white for red.

123
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:53,926
We learned about color
illusion in art class, right?

124
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:56,835
The killer was wearing a white blouse.

125
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,535
You're brilliant, Narita!

126
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:01,839
That means the killer
must be Mika Hoshino!

127
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:04,773
Maybe.

128
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:08,648
We've got to do something
before she kills someone else.

129
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:09,514
But...

130
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:10,547
But?

131
00:25:11,187 --> 00:25:15,351
Hoshino's not to blame.
It's the replinoids.

132
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:24,326
Look, I brought the Hero's
Sword you gave me. And this!

133
00:25:29,538 --> 00:25:33,668
I'll destroy the replinoids
and save Saotome!

134
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:39,078
Lucky Saotome.

135
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:40,073
Huh?

136
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:51,482
See you tomorrow.

137
00:25:59,602 --> 00:26:01,570
Mika, what about dinner?

138
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:04,973
Don't want any. I'm not hungry.

139
00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:18,876
What's gotten into her?

140
00:26:22,258 --> 00:26:26,092
All of a sudden she's wearing makeup,
and she won't eat.

141
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,756
I wonder if she's started going
with a bad crowd.

142
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,165
Maybe she found a boyfriend.

143
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,698
A boyfriend? That's a good one!

144
00:26:39,408 --> 00:26:41,774
It's nothing to laugh about!

145
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:20,639
Women's Changing Room

146
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,974
If we're going to solve this thing...

147
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:26,947
Turn around! I'm trying to get changed!

148
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,844
She sure has a great bod.

149
00:28:34,323 --> 00:28:36,314
Let's go find Mika Hoshino.

150
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:39,821
She hasn't been around since this
afternoon.

151
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:43,331
Then we have to act quickly.

152
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:44,792
Narita!

153
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:50,195
My panties.

154
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:54,008
You're depraved!

155
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:12,127
Fine Arts Club

156
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,225
Mika Hoshino.

157
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,699
I've been waiting for you.

158
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:30,108
You have?

159
00:29:30,913 --> 00:29:34,110
I need to talk to you.

160
00:29:39,355 --> 00:29:42,654
I've had my eye on you.

161
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:45,659
Hoshino.

162
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:51,099
I get so flustered and confused
when I think of you.

163
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:55,125
That's strange. Not a tentacle in sight.

164
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,003
My heart aches for you.

165
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:03,476
Okay, I get it. But I don't
think this is the time to...

166
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,440
I like you so much.

167
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:15,822
I do!

168
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:21,285
Hang on, I don't think this is right...

169
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,233
When another woman gets close
to you, I get so jealous.

170
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:29,166
Hoshino!

171
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:34,566
I won't let anyone else have you!

172
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:41,745
Damn, I can't move! It was you, Hoshino!

173
00:30:57,466 --> 00:30:58,490
Narita!

174
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:30,595
Narita!

175
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,360
Narita! Narita!

176
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,005
It might not be too late!

177
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:44,970
I'll give him this ball,
left from the last replinoid.

178
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,413
What is it, Flash Rabbit?

179
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:00,087
I see. It was a parasite in Hoshino.

180
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:03,257
Then it metamorphosed into a replinoid.

181
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,796
That's right! I have to hurry
and give him this ball!

182
00:32:34,129 --> 00:32:36,427
Flash Rabbit, hurry and
give him the ball!

183
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:40,796
Quit playing with it, stupid!
Put it in his mouth!

184
00:32:51,647 --> 00:32:52,409
Narita!

185
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:56,847
Oh no!

186
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,282
Drop the gun, Megumi Iijima!

187
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:11,092
Take off your suit, if you
want to save Narita.

188
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:14,324
Now!

189
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,876
Okay, I will.

190
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:58,413
I'm not going to kill you quickly,
Megumi Iijima.

191
00:33:58,447 --> 00:34:01,211
I'll suck your blood very, very slowly.

192
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,811
No! Stop!

193
00:34:11,193 --> 00:34:14,788
How does it feel to have
the life sucked out of you?

194
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:17,760
Hurry, Narita!

195
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:35,542
Nice tits.

196
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:50,922
I'm finished, Narita!

197
00:34:58,874 --> 00:35:00,739
No!

198
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:10,582
What?!

199
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,836
I'll save you, Saotome.

200
00:35:35,877 --> 00:35:37,811
Narita, you came back to life!

201
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:55,790
You bastard!

202
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:08,967
I've had enough of you!
Say your prayers!

203
00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:14,839
Narita!

204
00:36:15,851 --> 00:36:17,341
What? Hoshino?

205
00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:20,216
They've completely merged!

206
00:36:22,357 --> 00:36:23,756
Help me!

207
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:36,627
Narita.

208
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:41,142
Hoshino!

209
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:44,072
Narita!

210
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:47,279
Take this!

211
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,197
Thank you, Narita.

212
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:15,866
You bastard!

213
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,227
Are you okay?

214
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:39,165
Not exactly.

215
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:43,962
Yeah, I think I got it in the eye, too.

216
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:50,577
What happened to me?

217
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:54,580
When you killed that first replinoid...

218
00:37:54,616 --> 00:37:57,176
...there was a glowing ball left behind.

219
00:37:57,853 --> 00:38:00,549
It has the power to bring
you back to life.

220
00:38:01,356 --> 00:38:03,017
What are you talking about?

221
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:04,949
That thing.

222
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:17,232
That ball is Hoshino's life.

223
00:38:52,941 --> 00:38:54,408
Narita!

224
00:38:58,113 --> 00:39:00,104
Wait! Let's walk home together!

225
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,448
Sure. Want to go for a tea or something?

226
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:04,543
By the way...

227
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:21,993
Sure it's all right? You're positive?

228
00:39:27,475 --> 00:39:28,635
Yeah! I think.

229
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:33,210
You think?! Oh, I don't feel very good!

230
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:37,218
Are you okay? Here, I have another one.

231
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:44,582
Are you sure it's okay
to take these things?

232
00:39:44,993 --> 00:39:48,759
There might be some side effects.

233
00:39:49,898 --> 00:39:52,025
Hey! What do you mean "side effects"?!

234
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,663
You might turn into a replinoid!

235
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:58,428
A replinoid?!

236
00:39:59,808 --> 00:40:01,105
Just kidding!

237
00:40:03,411 --> 00:40:04,173
Iijima!

238
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:06,909
Wait!

239
00:40:44,419 --> 00:40:51,120
To Narita From Maiko Saotome
