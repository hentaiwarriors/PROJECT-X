1
00:00:00,647 --> 00:00:02,046
I am God.

2
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:05,707
The People from the world
of Light and Shadow, listen to my words.

3
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:10,182
I've created light as well as darkness,
but that's not the final state.

4
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:13,692
One day you will finally get
a complete state.

5
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:17,224
Before that day comes,
I have built this in steel...

6
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:20,460
to divide the world
into light and shadow.

7
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:23,435
This is the story of Persia and April.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,596
They are the swordswomen
from the Race of Light.

9
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:29,464
Another adventure of light and shadow.

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,744
Full of love and courage.

11
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:37,173
WORDSWORTH

12
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:40,286
No!

13
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:42,184
Stop!

14
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:46,223
Stop it!

15
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,093
Such pretty little titties.

16
00:00:56,703 --> 00:01:00,434
Nobody is going to marry me now!
Norman! Norman!

17
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:02,475
Norman, I am so sorry.

18
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:06,610
Norman, I'm sorry!

19
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,077
It's never felt so good.

20
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:15,552
Stop it! No!

21
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:20,989
Push, harder. Harder!

22
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:28,266
Yes! Yes!

23
00:01:29,636 --> 00:01:32,696
I'm coming!

24
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:11,975
Stop pretending that you don't like it.
I know you do.

25
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:16,706
Feel the horsepower.

26
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:40,329
Let me go, don't do that.

27
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:42,464
No.

28
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:02,351
Don't be rude to me please,
don't hurt me! Please.

29
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:04,887
No.

30
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,656
Please, please don't.

31
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:19,703
Norman, I'm sorry.

32
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:25,114
I may not be able to see you again,
please forgive me.

33
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:28,186
You may do it anyway you like.

34
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:31,322
But this is my very first time.

35
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:34,017
Please.

36
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,229
Please don't hurt me.

37
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,704
I'm going to lose my virginity...

38
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:53,241
but that's what I've been guarding.

39
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:00,148
What a beautiful pussy.

40
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:11,330
Look at that. What a pussy.

41
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:13,257
How embarrassing.

42
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:15,431
Embarrassing.

43
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
Yeah!

44
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:25,733
This is great!

45
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:39,555
What are you talking about, new stuff?

46
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,920
That's the two of us.

47
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,766
You bad boy,
you make us become crazy like this.

48
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:00,469
You bad thing.

49
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:12,588
I haven't touched a good guy
like this for a long time.

50
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:14,250
Are you feeling horny, honey?

51
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:18,086
Yeah.

52
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,157
I've got to keep my head.

53
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:22,625
What do you want?

54
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,036
Nothing. I just want you
to be yourself.

55
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:39,207
Be downright myself?
You're the same as that monster.

56
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,909
All you want...

57
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:48,019
I'm going to lose my virginity.

58
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:56,333
Yes.

59
00:05:57,804 --> 00:06:00,671
It feels so good, so good.

60
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:06,712
So good!

61
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,949
No, it hurts!

62
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:18,422
So good.

63
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,958
Don't stop. No, don't stop.

64
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:37,433
What a big cock!

65
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:41,241
No! It hurts, it hurts!

66
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:44,205
No!

67
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:48,347
It hurts, do it faster, faster!

68
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:52,113
Yes!

69
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:54,182
Yes!

70
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:57,621
It hurts but feels so good.

71
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,163
Yes!

72
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:11,767
Harder! Harder!

73
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,503
Much better, much better.

74
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:21,019
So good.

75
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:31,921
I'm coming!

76
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,128
Don't stop!

77
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:41,462
Yes!

78
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,114
Miss Sabrina! No don't!

79
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:57,718
Thought you were fleeing
from the enemy?

80
00:07:58,057 --> 00:08:01,220
But you actually cast eyes
at the man from the Race of Light!

81
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:03,454
But, that man was injured.

82
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,830
Don't feel sympathy for our enemies!

83
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,131
Don't forget, we are on the battlefield!

84
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:11,662
No!

85
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:15,263
You keep saying no,
but look, it has gotten so wet!

86
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,379
How many times I've told you?

87
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,449
On the battlefield,
you've got to forget yourself as a woman.

88
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,883
You don't understand
if you're being sensible down there!

89
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,522
No, don't stop.

90
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,268
Stop it, no, I can't take it.

91
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:51,572
How are you going to do if you've such
bad stamina and endurance?

92
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:54,812
Be patient, and hang on!

93
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:57,442
No!

94
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,709
Not that.

95
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:07,925
Right, very good, hang on
you're going to be a real fighter.

96
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:11,487
And now this, how does it feel?

97
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:17,326
Being a fighter of the Race of Light...

98
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,439
- I've got to keep hanging on.
- Persia, let's fight.

99
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,768
Miss Sabrina...

100
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:31,311
How does it feel this way?

101
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:42,585
I've got to hang on. Yes!

102
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:47,064
Now you do it to me!

103
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,495
No, do it like this.

104
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:57,431
Yes!

105
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:02,141
Let me try it.

106
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:12,680
Right, yeah, harder Persia, do it harder.

107
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,091
I can't stand it anymore.

108
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,665
Be downright myself.

109
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:28,874
Yes, I must not be eligible
for being a swordsman.

110
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:32,707
I've better go home
and wait for Norman there.

111
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,172
Goodbye!

112
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,851
What a strange woman.

113
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:02,399
How many times have I screwed?

114
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,495
Wow. That's so cool!

115
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:44,138
How far down must it go?

116
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,388
That's kind of scary.

117
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,100
I think a battle just broke out.

118
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:11,504
The main-force units of Fabrees
has begun their prime formation of attack.

119
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:15,776
Now hurry up! We've got to meet Fabrees.

120
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:17,006
Yes!

121
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,646
You humans are weird,
but so entertaining.

122
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:52,711
You claim that you have
a love of your fellow man...

123
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:54,876
and yet at the same time
you want to kill each other.

124
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:01,358
I would love to stay and watch
the swelling scene...

125
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:04,054
but unfortunately, I'd be suspected.
So off I go.

126
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,499
I've got to seduce him into leading
me to the ultimate destination.

127
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:10,727
The road of self-destruction.

128
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:22,739
What the hell?

129
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:27,279
That thing is cool,
but it's dangerous.

130
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,255
He looks strong.

131
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:40,262
Hope I don't need to fight him later.

132
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:46,195
Look at that pasty-faced old man
just came out of nowhere!

133
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:48,933
It's Shalom!

134
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:51,509
Can't get down from here.

135
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:57,039
I don't know. That old man
was able to get down from here.

136
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:18,463
Does this path lead to the Race of Light?

137
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,603
Who cares?
I better get to Shalom soon.

138
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,431
So, here it is.

139
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:32,275
Do you really think I would let you pass
from here and get to Fabrees?

140
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:38,289
How come the doors are closed?

141
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:39,288
You're trapped!

142
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,950
Look, the sister
on the wooden horse is back!

143
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,456
Shut up!

144
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:46,524
Mister Esterla.

145
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:49,096
Didn't you fall off the mountain?

146
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,303
But how did you get here
ahead of us?

147
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,430
You wouldn't believe
all the things that happened.

148
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,404
Who cares?

149
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll kill all those who hinder my way!
Now and in the future!

150
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:01,375
I'm telling you,
and now you've been warned.

151
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:05,844
Damn you! I'm going to kill you.

152
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,034
Miss Sabrina!

153
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:35,004
Damn it Persia, don't forget our deal?

154
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:38,114
Persia, promise you won't forget
what I said...

155
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:40,478
you won't forget the deal we made
the other day.

156
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:45,252
Certainly not, and I won't escape
from the enemy ever again, I promise.

157
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:46,918
Then go and do it!

158
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,253
Beat the enemy, beat the Race
of Shadow. Beat them for me.

159
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:54,296
Yes!

160
00:15:57,103 --> 00:16:00,595
Mister Esterla, prepare to die!

161
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,550
You bastard!

162
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:18,113
If you are a swordsman,
then you better battle it out like one!

163
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:26,725
Persia.

164
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:07,161
Come on! Do it, just kill me!
And get it over with.

165
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:11,208
You're not any good at fighting
or battles anyhow.

166
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:35,894
That's caused by the cannon
that's outside.

167
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:42,239
Watch out!

168
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:06,798
Mr. Esterla!

169
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:12,267
Miss Sabrina!

170
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:18,201
Persia, don't you forget our deal?

171
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:24,046
Go and beat down
the Race of Shadow.

172
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:33,721
Go and beat down
the Race of Shadow.

173
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:35,252
Persia!

174
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,017
Persia!

175
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:26,475
You are so tender.
My name is Esterla, what's yours?

176
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:29,778
Watch out!

177
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:38,320
I can't do it.

178
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:39,649
I just can't.

179
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,474
What's happening?

180
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:45,918
Mr. Esterla will also train me
to become a swordsman like him?

181
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:51,925
No, don't.

182
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:04,903
No, what are you doing to me?

183
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:10,045
Come on, you don't need to be
so reluctant, I'll be gentle.

184
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:18,614
Don't worry about it, you can make
as much noise as you want.

185
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:21,651
What a shame!

186
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:25,324
You can't become a swordsman this way.

187
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:30,297
Have to hang on...

188
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:33,369
I've got to stand the test.

189
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:36,065
Please get it in me!

190
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:57,619
I can't stand it anymore!
Give it to me.

191
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,819
I need it!

192
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:00,893
Give me more.

193
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:08,000
So, you really can take this?

194
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:17,307
That's beautiful,
let me make it get wetter.

195
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:33,626
I don't care at all,
I just want more!

196
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:35,256
Yes! Yes!

197
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,231
Okay, how about this?

198
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,767
No, don't do that.

199
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:44,731
You can't.

200
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,444
It's so warm, it's so hot inside you,
that's great.

201
00:22:56,021 --> 00:23:01,425
It's the very first time and I'm going
to stand the test. I can do it!

202
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:08,156
It's great. Come on, go faster!

203
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:15,337
It's great to be a swordsman. Yes!

204
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:18,974
I love to be a swordsman.

205
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:35,425
I love to be a swordsman!

206
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:36,850
Don't stop!

207
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:42,426
I'm coming!

208
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:52,866
What am I going to do?
How am I going to get this door open?

209
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:58,908
He's got to leave.
I can't stop him from going.

210
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:01,383
But I can't teach the enemy...

211
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:05,548
the secret to the location
of the key that opens the door.

212
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,050
What should I do?

213
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:12,158
Yeah!

214
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:15,627
I can pretend to be talking in my sleep.

215
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,135
The jewel on Ms. Sabrina's sword hilt
is the key to open the door.

216
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:41,156
Thank you very much.

217
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:45,188
Dear Mister Esterla.

218
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:54,136
Go!

219
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:05,177
Good luck, Mr. Esterla!
Good Luck.

220
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:10,286
I am God.

221
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:14,715
People from the world of Light and Shadow,
listen to my words...

222
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:20,363
I've created light as well as darkness,
but that's not the final state.

223
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,995
One day you will finally
get a complete state.

224
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:29,430
Before the day comes,
I have built this in steel.

225
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:33,642
To divide this world
into light and shadow.
