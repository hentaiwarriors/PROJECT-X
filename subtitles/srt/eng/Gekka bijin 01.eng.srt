1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,710
Seiichi...

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,840
Seiichi!

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,450
Seiichi, where are you?

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,540
Rin, I'm over here.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,920
Come here.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,390
Wait for me, Seiichi.
I'm coming for you now!

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,560
What's wrong?

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,530
Seiichi, I can't come to you.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,970
I can't reach you
chained up like this!

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,770
I see.
You don't want to come.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,170
That's not true!

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,580
Really?

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,000
Really!

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,210
Hm... You seem
to be telling the truth.

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,620
You look like you want it so badly,
you could almost die.

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,450
Look.

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,750
Relish it.

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,520
Are you happy, Rin?

19
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,630
Seiichi...

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,540
Seiichi!

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,330
Who's there?

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,460
Seiichi!

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,810
Dad!

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,550
Seiichi...
How could you do this to me?

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,210
Seiichi! Seiichi!

26
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,350
Seiichi?

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,950
Seiichi?

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,550
Seiichi?

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,930
The apartment manager.

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,570
Oh, my. You're all worn out
from your unexpected move.

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,670
I want to show you
around the Kazahana Inn.

32
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,330
So please get up, okay?

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:50,410
Maison Plaisir
The Queen of the Night: Part I

34
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,650
My name is Seiichi Itoh.

35
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,090
I'm studying for my second try
at the college entrance exams.

36
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,920
I came here for the final
stages of my studies.

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,990
At least, that's the polite reason
I'm here.

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,460
The truth is...

39
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,790
Well, you'll find that out
soon enough.

40
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,780
The second floor toilet is just
to the side of your room, Seiichi.

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,380
And as for the room
down the hall...

42
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,940
That door must never
be opened.

43
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,810
By that, you mean...

44
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,710
It just won't open
no matter how much you jiggle it.

45
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,890
This is where you hang your clothes
to dry or do a little sunbathing.

46
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,790
Must get them nice and soft, huh?

47
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,530
Wha...

48
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,630
Let me introduce you.

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,910
This is Hiro Haga,
the town council leader.

50
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,210
They call him
the Guardian of the Town.

51
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,310
Hi there!

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,410
Um, hello. How do you do?

53
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,150
Ah! Such a spirited
greeting you gave!

54
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,750
On patrol, Councilman?

55
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,930
M-M-Miyuki, is that you?

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,690
As you can see,
he's got the hots for Miyuki.

57
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,220
No!

58
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,900
Oh, no! Time for
my neighborhood patrol!

59
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,200
We shall meet again!

60
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,940
Why'd he jump
over the wall?

61
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,600
Well, I'm headed
back to the office.

62
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,950
Take care of the rest, Miyuki.

63
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,210
Sure thing.

64
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,580
Um, Miss Miyuki?

65
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,560
Is that Nagi Yukimura character
a guy or a girl?

66
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,190
I'm not really sure myself.

67
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,620
Hm...

68
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,700
And your chief councilman...

69
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,600
He's sorta "weird," huh?

70
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,800
You're asking...
if he's "weird"?

71
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,640
That's a difficult question.

72
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,600
What makes a person "weird"?

73
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,700
What makes them "normal"?

74
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,050
I don't think anyone
can answer that question.

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,280
Perhaps some stray
from what is accepted behavior,

76
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,850
but perhaps doing that
brings them happiness.

77
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,230
You think pretty deeply
about things, don't you?

78
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,930
I'm moved!

79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,530
Oops. Sorry!
What am I babbling about?

80
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,670
Don't mind me,
just forget what I said.

81
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,110
"Normal," huh?

82
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,810
I'm not exactly
what you'd call "normal," either.

83
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,950
Seiichi...

84
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,550
I'm so happy.

85
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,880
Training my own mother!

86
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,030
Even if she is my dad's second wife
and not a blood relation.

87
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,870
Hmm? What's that sound?

88
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,470
Is this place haunted?

89
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,180
Hey! Keep it down!

90
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,310
I can't study
for my exams if you're...

91
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,750
Huh? It's not coming
from here, is it?

92
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,650
Wh- Who are you?

93
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,420
Sorry! I'm Kasumi Amamiya
from next door.

94
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,420
So, you're the guy who's
on strike two of his exams, huh?

95
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,460
Who cares
what strike I'm on?

96
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,390
Seiichi Itoh.
How do you do?

97
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,670
So, you're studying
for your exams, too, huh?

98
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,370
Um, well...

99
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,200
What's that?
Late night snack?

100
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,110
Nighty-night!

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,280
So, are you used
to the Kazahana Inn, yet?

102
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,190
Yeah, I'm settled in.

103
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,310
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

104
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,750
It's thanks to your
kind hospitality, Miss Miyuki.

105
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,390
Even the way you got
my meal for me like this.

106
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,590
Huh?

107
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,190
Oh! I forgot!

108
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,830
We're out of soy sauce.

109
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,430
I'll go and buy some!

110
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,840
Oh, you don't have
to do it right now.

111
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,900
I'll be right back.

112
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,980
She's kinda impatient.

113
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,780
What's this?

114
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,070
Yo!

115
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,700
Holy...
Wh-what are you doing up here?

116
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,510
Is something troubling you, man?

117
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,910
No, not really.

118
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,240
Excellent!

119
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,220
Only by suffering
and overcoming that suffering...

120
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,650
can one truly grow!

121
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,860
Keep worrying!
It'll give you lots of worry lines!

122
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,720
I'm off!

123
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,690
That musclehead
doesn't know his strength!

124
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,960
Amou Family Grave

125
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,740
Thank you, Seiichi.

126
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,780
That's okay. I followed you
because I wanted to talk.

127
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,120
My late husband Heizou
died on this day of the month.

128
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,780
I visit his grave
once a month on this day.

129
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,780
You still love him,
don't you?

130
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,420
I'm sorry. I need to get
some groceries before I go home.

131
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,030
Go ahead
and go home without me.

132
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,950
What's this?

133
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,360
What the hell?

134
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,600
This is my room!

135
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,770
So that's what
the cucumber was for.

136
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,940
That technique won't
help you pass any exams.

137
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,220
Prickly...

138
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,120
Feels all prickly inside!

139
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,220
Still, she has
room for improvement.

140
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,930
Where does
this staircase lead to?

141
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,210
This is a training room!

142
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,510
I'm home!

143
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,460
Heizou, my love...

144
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,270
Heizou...

145
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,990
Heizou!

146
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,690
Heizou.

147
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,590
The man who trained her.

148
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,700
That notebook I saw...

149
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,610
It was the diary
Heizou kept of her training.

150
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,750
Their meeting
was inevitable.

151
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,350
His sense
as a bondage master...

152
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,880
Let him see the great potential
Miyuki had within her.

153
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,150
Shortly thereafter,
he began training her.

154
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,510
Perhaps it was due
to her natural talents,

155
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,670
but her training proceeded better
than Heizou could have expected.

156
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,960
They married,

157
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,460
but soon after opening
the Kazahana Inn,

158
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,790
illness took Heizou
from this world.

159
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,700
And Miyuki's training...

160
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,270
was left incomplete.

161
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,980
She still can't forget
about Heizou.

162
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,680
Heizou, my love!

163
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,560
You saw it, didn't you?
The secret of the Kazahana Inn.

164
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,810
Yukimura, why did you
bring me here?

165
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,040
To prepare you
for what has to come.

166
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,550
We wish for you
to complete her training.

167
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,480
The training of Miyuki Amou,

168
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,710
which was contracted
to my incompetent pupil, Heizou!

169
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,850
Who's there?

170
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,620
The chief of the Jonen Temple...

171
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,520
Sohun Chinen!

172
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,030
So, you are
Rin's adopted son, eh?

173
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,570
Y-You know my mother?

174
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,270
Indeed! And I know that
you ran away from your father...

175
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,800
after he stopped you
from training your new mother!

176
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,440
Master Sohun was Rin's master.

177
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,290
He also happens
to be the head...

178
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,410
of the real estate
company I work for.

179
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,320
You've read Heizou's notebook,
haven't you?

180
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,720
If you have,
then you understand.

181
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:44,160
How he only thought of Miyuki
as a tool for him to exploit.

182
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,490
How he thoughtlessly tied Miyuki
to himself emotionally.

183
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,540
She now sees him
as the ideal husband,

184
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,970
and she remains trapped
in that false world view.

185
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,310
Seiichi Itoh!

186
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,340
You must free Miyuki Amou's heart
from Heizou's control!

187
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,050
When you achieve that,
you shall...

188
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,060
reopen the path
to true bondage mastery!

189
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,290
Training?
What do you mean?

190
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,760
Don't try to fool me,
Miyuki.

191
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,100
I don't know what you mean!
What is it?

192
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,170
Seiichi, what are you doing?

193
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,300
You have to be more honest
with yourself!

194
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,200
Stop it, please!

195
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,580
I'll scream!

196
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,850
Then scream!

197
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,410
You do that.
Scream as loudly as you want!

198
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,820
No!

199
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,660
Miyuki, do you get wet
just hearing about training?

200
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,260
That's not true!

201
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,690
I wonder...

202
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,890
No, don't!

203
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,130
See? I knew it!

204
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,140
Stop it, please!

205
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,180
In short, this means you're
not a "normal" person, doesn't it?

206
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,740
You want it, don't you?

207
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,990
Your body can't help
but long for the touch of the rope.

208
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,330
Perhaps I had dreamed
for this day to finally come...

209
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,870
...since the moment
I first saw Seiichi.

210
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,950
I can't breathe!

211
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,010
Maybe because
your breasts are so big.

212
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,910
Does milk come out of them?

213
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,290
Of course not!

214
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,230
Well then, I'll have to squeeze
some of my juice out, instead.

215
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,430
No!

216
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,260
I climaxed from
the deepest core of my body.

217
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,930
He was just like Heizou.

218
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,110
And so, there was
no way I'd regret this.

219
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:17,150
I started to retrain her that day.

220
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,420
Hi. How's your studying
coming along?

221
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,190
Okay, I guess.
By the way,

222
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,790
have you been hearing
that weird sound lately?

223
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,760
Oh? Have you?

224
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,670
It bugs me so much
that I can't concentrate.

225
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,800
On your studies
or on your other activities?

226
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,700
The other activities,
of course.

227
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,610
You like that prickly feeling
a cucumber gives you, huh?

228
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,520
Huh? What are you
talking about?

229
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,950
No use...
I'm going to pop!

230
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,290
My ass is full!

231
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,100
Hold it in.

232
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,860
Please!
Let me use the toilet!

233
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,440
Do it from there.

234
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,700
I can't!
I'm too embarrassed!

235
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,940
Oh, it's coming out!

236
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,970
I can't hold it...

237
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,800
No! You shouldn't
waste food like this.

238
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,730
So just eat it later.

239
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,430
No, I couldn't!

240
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,400
Just hang in there
till I'm through.

241
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,580
Here I cum, Miss Miyuki.

242
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,190
The woman with
the day face and the night face...

243
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,530
Miyuki Amou.

244
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,300
By night,
a sex-crazed animal.

245
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,400
By day, an apartment manager
who shows none of that.

246
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,140
It reminded me of a flower
called "Moonflower."

247
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,150
It opens up in the late afternoon
through the evening.

248
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,750
In the morning,
it closes its blossoms.

249
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,150
Such a sad flower.

250
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,860
Its image overlapped
with her in my mind.

251
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,090
And in the language of flowers,
it means "illicit Love Affair."

252
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,330
I found it amusing how it echoed
her relationship with Heizou.

253
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,670
So I decided to use
Heizou's techniques on her.

254
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,680
I was confident that they would
have the best results on her.

255
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,690
Seiichi, this is what
Heizou used to do to me!

256
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,920
Stop it, please!

257
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,450
I'm afraid we can't.

258
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,990
Please! Don't!

259
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
Then how about this?

260
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,000
No!

261
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,170
It hurts!

262
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,810
Forgive me.
Please forgive me, Seiichi!

263
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,910
It's not your fault,

264
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,710
but I just can't do this!

265
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,080
What's wrong with it?

266
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,710
What's with that look?

267
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,880
Don't you want this?

268
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,950
I know I shouldn't be,
but I'm reminded of Heizou!

269
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,920
Please... untie me!

270
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,730
So you don't like it
when I do it?

271
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,860
It's my fault.

272
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,310
Heizou was Heizou.

273
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,370
And Seiichi, you're still naive.

274
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,270
So you're saying
I suck at this?

275
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,270
Seiichi...

276
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,690
I figured you'd
come to me eventually.

277
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,390
You're here to say that
unless you improve your techniques,

278
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,950
you'll never free Miyuki's heart
from Heizou's control, correct?

279
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,550
Am I wrong?

280
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,790
Hmm...

281
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,130
In that case...

282
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,900
Use this room
to perfect your technique!

283
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,370
Yes, sir!

284
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,810
Make your roping
techniques faster!

285
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,440
Go on!
Practice every trick exactly!

286
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Don't neglect
any of the essentials!

287
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,020
And finally...
Train yourself!

288
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,560
At first, I was
very impatient with her.

289
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,180
But as her responses improved,

290
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,540
I responded to her in turn.

291
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,420
Councilman!

292
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,470
Hi!

293
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,540
Lately, when I'm with her,

294
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,510
I feel strangely at ease.

295
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,270
Even when we aren't training,

296
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,040
I always want to be with her.

297
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,810
It's as though
we were lovers.

298
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,750
That sweet feeling I had...

299
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,910
Of course, that's not what a bondage
master is supposed to feel.

300
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,690
I decided to modify the techniques
that had failed Heizou before.

301
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,340
Seiichi, no!
This technique is...

302
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,610
What are you talking about?
Your cunt is dripping wet from this!

303
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,850
But you're making me do it
in such an embarrassing way!

304
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,750
Okay, then we'll
go for a walk!

305
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,090
Let's go outside like this!

306
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,890
No! Don't!

307
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,020
Oh, no... I'm going to cum!

308
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,800
Not yet! Do it
where everyone can see!

309
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,600
Please, stop it!

310
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,660
Here we go!

311
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,770
No! I'm so ashamed!

312
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,940
No use...
Can't hold on anymore.

313
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,950
I'm cumming! I'm cumming!

314
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,280
It's snowing.

315
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,010
Come in.

316
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,810
Miss Miyuki.

317
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,990
What sort of special request?

318
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,890
You don't mean...

319
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,960
Hang you up in the snow?

320
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,770
Seiichi...

321
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,870
As you wish.

322
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,560
She was lovely.

323
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,220
The snow settled
softly upon her.

324
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,960
It was like she was
a natural part of the scenery.

325
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,400
Quite elegant, in fact.

326
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,410
But what did she
expect me to do now?

327
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,580
If we keep this up...

328
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,580
Miss Miyuki!
We should stop this!

329
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,250
Longer... Leave me
a bit longer, Seiichi...

330
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,760
Why do you want
to go this far?

331
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,300
If you keep this up,
you'll die!

332
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,130
Miss Miyuki! Miss Miyuki!

333
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,010
Are you all right?

334
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,370
Seiichi...

335
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,280
Heizou is finally vanishing
from inside of me.

336
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,350
What I loved was
his techniques, not him.

337
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,790
Let me say
my last farewell to him.

338
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,730
You're sure about this?

339
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,370
Heizou...Farewell.

340
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:04,270
Ta...ka...sa...go...

341
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,130
Sohun, really!

342
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,770
You're not a Shinto priest,
so quit it with that prayer!

343
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,370
- Oh, right.
- Yes, Master!

344
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,780
What a weird monk!

345
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,510
In any case, congratulations.

346
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,720
Right, Seiichi and Miyuki?

347
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,990
I hope it isn't
too shocking...

348
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,650
that I ended up
marrying Miyuki.

349
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,820
Okay, everyone! Come see
the results of our training!

350
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,860
Oh, Master Seiichi!

351
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,890
I love you with all my heart!

352
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,570
Here it comes!

353
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,910
The trainer
and the trained...

354
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,670
There must be a connection
between the hearts of both.

355
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,920
Perhaps it's love
that binds them.

356
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,680
Yes, that's what training is.

357
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,950
The ultimate
expression of love.

358
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,050
I had gained a flower...

359
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,360
that could greet the dawn
in full blossom.

360
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,960
And with it, the greatest
happiness in the world.

361
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,930
Master Seiichi...

362
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,850
Cold love is...

363
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,360
staring you in the eye.

364
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,590
It affected the other...

365
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,260
person in the other direction.

366
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,770
Reciting an...

367
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,730
explosive memory.

368
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,570
Discovering love for the first time.

369
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,740
Angry, angry last girlfriend.

370
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:58,210
Look at the back of the nocturne.

371
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,480
It's the sort of time when it drifted...

372
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,860
lightly, lightly.

373
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,990
Out in the country...

374
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,020
Love intended that one.

375
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,590
I could see from memory...

376
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,300
spreading out, spreading out.

377
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,340
I want to know...

378
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,680
someone very closely.
