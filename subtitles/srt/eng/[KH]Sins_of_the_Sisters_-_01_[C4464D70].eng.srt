1
00:00:09,438 --> 00:00:10,530
Lord!

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,406
Guide us Crusaders to
the Holy Land, Jerusalem.

3
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:27,179
Lord.

4
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:30,719
Where is this ship going?!

5
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:35,354
Isn't it going to Jerusalem?

6
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:41,333
How foolish!

7
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:45,429
You're going to be sold
as slaves on the Ivory Coast.

8
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:47,074
You're mistaken!

9
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:52,012
We're going to Jerusalem
as ordered by the Pope!

10
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:54,081
I am the leader, Hans.

11
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:57,913
You've been sold by the Pope.
Wanna see the contract?

12
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:00,913
What?!

13
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:06,384
- Hans?! What is going on?
- Tell us!

14
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:19,599
Lord!

15
00:01:19,808 --> 00:01:23,869
We believed in you. Is this how
you treat us in return?!

16
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:24,946
Lord!

17
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:28,749
Johann! Pierre!

18
00:01:29,284 --> 00:01:30,216
Marco!

19
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:31,943
Michel!!

20
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,420
I no longer believe in God!

21
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:39,892
For my friends who've been
betrayed...

22
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:40,984
...someday...

23
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:44,259
...someday, I shall take revenge!!

24
00:01:50,572 --> 00:01:53,905
I will become a fallen angel...

25
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,500
...and dispel our disgrace!

26
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:55,095
Working hard as usual, I see.

27
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,059
Old Sage!

28
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:06,237
Has there been any change
in your wife's condition?

29
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:08,366
No, thanks to you.

30
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:11,674
Except for her eyes,
she's doing quite well.

31
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:16,111
I've obtained a good herb.
I'll come by later on.

32
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:18,278
Thank you so much.

33
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:20,716
How peaceful...

34
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,455
How truly peaceful...

35
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:24,456
Indeed.

36
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:26,049
Since the Amakusa Restoration...

37
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:27,924
...the world has never seen
any wars.

38
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:30,088
It's as if time has stopped.

39
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:31,432
Oh, no.

40
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:36,994
The eternal flow of time rushes
forth with certainty.

41
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,907
As long as there is no
countercurrent...

42
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:40,940
What?

43
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:45,435
Oh, nothing. Just talking
to myself, that's all.

44
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:52,945
Say, isn't today the anniversary
of the Amakusa Restoration and...

45
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:56,649
...of those who served the cause,
the St. Michaela Female Crusade?

46
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:00,151
Oh, that's right.

47
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:05,826
Well, I should go offer them
a flower or something.

48
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:08,498
Excuse me.

49
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:31,457
This world, without national
or religious divisions...

50
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,825
The world without wars
amongst peoples...

51
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,161
This is the fruit of the Amakusa
Restoration, initiated...

52
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:43,169
...by these Female Crusaders of
St. Michaela's College.

53
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:47,167
However, after the Restoration,
the history has been erased...

54
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:51,302
...between the Great War of East
Asia and the Shohwa period.

55
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:54,041
Am I the only one that knows
this lost history?

56
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:58,344
The Restoration literally turned
back time in the process.

57
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:04,490
Thus, whoever remembers even
a shred of the lost time...

58
00:06:04,593 --> 00:06:06,288
...must be terminated.

59
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:08,219
No matter who it may be.

60
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:24,510
Yuki?

61
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:38,884
Daisuke... died in battle...

62
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:40,758
Yuki.

63
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:42,923
Calm down, Yuki.

64
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,599
Who's Daisuke?

65
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:51,238
Died in battle?
There is no war anywhere.

66
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:54,706
The Restoration in Amakusa was
the last such thing.

67
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,677
You're right.

68
00:06:56,778 --> 00:06:59,747
The Female Crusade overturned
the feudal government.

69
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:02,908
Then, the Roman Catholic Church
and the Holy Roman Empire...

70
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:04,315
...were also destroyed.

71
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:07,711
That's right. No more religions
and no more nations.

72
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:11,519
No more rotten wars that put
people against each other.

73
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:15,986
All thanks to
"Amakusa Hans" Aiko.

74
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:18,763
I don't know what's gotten
into me.

75
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:21,563
All I do is cause you trouble.

76
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,797
But... for some reason...

77
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:27,807
Every year, when I hear the bell
that marks the anniversary...

78
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:30,167
...I get such a headache.

79
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:35,574
...As if some unknown being is
shrieking deep inside my head.

80
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:39,751
But, I'm all right now.
I'm so sorry.

81
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:46,660
Why? Why is it?

82
00:07:57,872 --> 00:08:00,033
Aiko, how's the wound?

83
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:01,607
Kozue.

84
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:04,571
It's healed a great deal.

85
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:07,307
I'll be back to my old self
real soon.

86
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:09,474
I'm embarrassed to have
failed you.

87
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:10,846
But you haven't.

88
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:13,179
After the uprising at
St. Michaela's College...

89
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:15,779
we've waged war in Amakusa,
then against the feudal army...

90
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,883
...and on and on till we finally
took the Edo Castle here.

91
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:22,719
We thank you for pushing
the battle front.

92
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,367
Sorry you had to get hurt.

93
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:29,469
Nothing to be sorry about.

94
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:32,096
St. Michaela's College...

95
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:36,143
Even after all this, I can still
remember it like yesterday.

96
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,153
Pardon me, but I'm Aiko Mimura,
the new transfer student.

97
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:49,352
You have some gall,
my dear new student.

98
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,725
Where is your crucifix?

99
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:03,161
Dyed hair is against college
regulation!

100
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:05,271
So are those shoes and socks!

101
00:09:05,974 --> 00:09:07,737
Not to mention piercing!!

102
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:10,777
Everyone's all alike?
Wouldn't it negate identity?

103
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:13,376
Defiance calls for guidance!

104
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:15,949
Wow! An S & M show?

105
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,849
Ah! Hit me harder, please!

106
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:21,421
Oh, harder! Right there!

107
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,888
Mimura!

108
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:24,356
Aiko Mimura!

109
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:29,759
You have violated regulations
and rebelled against the Sister.

110
00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:33,194
Therefore, in the name of
the Female Crusade,

111
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:35,098
we shall penalize you!

112
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:39,201
In the name of the Crusade,
we shall penalize you!

113
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:41,832
No way... It's a joke, right?

114
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:44,075
It must be a joke...

115
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:47,205
A penalty will be served!

116
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:51,316
I couldn't believe how fierce
Rika and everyone were.

117
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:57,253
That's how we got acquainted
for the first time.

118
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,593
No sooner did I join the college
than I was on display...

119
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:03,095
...as an example of bad behavior.

120
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:07,590
But that's how I got to know
the Dean's right-hand man...

121
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:10,603
Daisuke Karino, and learn about
his plot against St. Michaela's.

122
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:13,196
And...

123
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,012
Devil!

124
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:23,910
You've come to ruin the sublime
mission of the Female Crusade.

125
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:25,417
You're the Devil!

126
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,644
The Devil?

127
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:28,485
Does the Devil...

128
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,889
Does the Devil have...

129
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,835
...these on her back?

130
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:50,009
Wing marks...

131
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:51,777
An angel?!

132
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:55,476
I confided everything to Rika.

133
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:01,449
I told her that Aiko Mimura...

134
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:05,492
...is an alias for Hans,
the leader of the Crusade...

135
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:10,690
...and about the tragedy of my
fellow crusaders back in 1212.

136
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:15,093
The same thing is about to
happen at St. Michaela's.

137
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:17,228
Using the name of God...

138
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:21,297
the Dean purports to prepare
you women for acting careers.

139
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:24,378
But in fact, it's a front for
a secret military mission...

140
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:28,438
...carried out by Daisuke Karino,
called the Michaela Project...

141
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,543
whereby you will be sent to the
battlefield as sex slaves.

142
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:34,487
That's a lie.

143
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:39,388
If I showed you proof I am
Hans in spite of being a woman...

144
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:43,723
would you believe me?

145
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,073
An androgyny...

146
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:01,912
Love is born out of freedom.

147
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:20,897
Forced celibacy is a feigned
myth borrowed from religion.

148
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:22,792
Come on...

149
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:15,079
You're an angel?

150
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:19,582
I'm not an angel blessed
with the grace of God.

151
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:29,696
I'm a fallen angel...
here to abolish God!

152
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:31,795
Now I need your help, Rika.

153
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:34,440
Hans...

154
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,344
No... Aiko!

155
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:41,778
Thus began our battle.

156
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:15,640
I am Hans Heilner!!

157
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:21,411
Then, in the battle against
Shiroh of Amakusa...

158
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,759
Please accept my warm welcome.
I am Shiroh Tokisada of Amakusa.

159
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:31,264
What do you want us to do?

160
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:33,957
In this part of the world,
I am God.

161
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:37,196
Let's fight together.
Paradise is near.

162
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:42,340
No!

163
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:47,073
We have killed many gods! No god
is exempt anywhere in the world!

164
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:49,381
I see...

165
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:57,151
Let me show you my godly power!

166
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:01,484
You impostor!!

167
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:06,063
There is no God.
Don't be fooled!

168
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:08,097
Rika!

169
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:22,944
Rika!

170
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:26,609
Rika!!

171
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:32,558
Hans... I love you.

172
00:15:33,494 --> 00:15:39,194
At least, I can die
knowing a first love.

173
00:15:40,301 --> 00:15:45,000
Thank you, Hans... Aiko...

174
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:51,406
Rika...

175
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:53,480
RIKA!!

176
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,823
Rika...

177
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:11,328
Rika Ikeda...

178
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:17,671
Rika Ikeda...

179
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:22,502
That's my name?
I don't know.

180
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:26,813
Together with Hans Aiko, Rika
revolted at St. Michaela's...

181
00:16:26,914 --> 00:16:30,577
...and died in Amakusa.
You're her departed spirit.

182
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:32,016
Died in Amakusa?!

183
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:35,113
I died?

184
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:41,652
Does that mean I'll never see
Aiko... or Hans, again?

185
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:47,324
I want to see Aiko,
my first love...

186
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,263
Do you want to see her?

187
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:57,367
Do you want to see
"Amakusa Hans" Aiko?

188
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,206
Who are you?

189
00:17:14,695 --> 00:17:15,992
How is it?

190
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:21,057
The back of the pupil
is damaged.

191
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:22,396
Here, gramps.

192
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:28,534
If this doesn't heal it,
it might just be incurable.

193
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:33,675
I don't care if my eyes ever
return to normal again.

194
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:36,911
Oh, stop it.
You mustn't think like that.

195
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:40,416
Your condition, one might say,
is psychological.

196
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:42,352
It depends on your attitude.

197
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:44,483
My attitude?

198
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:51,255
There's something you don't want
to see. That's your problem.

199
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:53,593
Something I don't want to see?

200
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:54,764
Right.

201
00:17:55,736 --> 00:17:57,636
Old Sage, what could it be?

202
00:17:58,472 --> 00:18:02,499
You shouldn't brood over it.
Right, Yayoi?

203
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:06,938
Yes. Sooner or later, you will
remember. Just wait and see.

204
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:09,548
Do you think so?

205
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:10,951
Sure.

206
00:18:16,824 --> 00:18:19,884
Say... may I ask you
one more thing?

207
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:21,921
What is it?

208
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:24,229
The dead...

209
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,968
Is it possible to raise the dead?

210
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,932
Raise the dead?

211
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:37,068
It's not impossible, but
it's a pain in the neck.

212
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:42,141
I can communicate with the dead.

213
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:48,745
I recalled a certain woman
of college age.

214
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:54,127
Her name is Rika Ikeda.

215
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:55,753
Rika Ikeda?

216
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:58,923
The one who went from
St. Michaela's to Amakusa...

217
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,194
...and died for the cause of
the Female Crusade?

218
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:05,903
Yes, she served the Restoration.

219
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,566
Alongside the leader,
"Amakusa Hans" Aiko...

220
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:11,702
she became a much respected figure.

221
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:15,777
Why on earth did you?

222
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,780
When I recall her, I feel as if
I'm with the "me" of old.

223
00:19:23,391 --> 00:19:27,987
Dead before fulfilling her love,
she seems unable to pass on.

224
00:19:28,095 --> 00:19:33,863
Though I've consummated my own,
there's another "me" inside...

225
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:37,665
that has lost her first love
and is crying, as it were.

226
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:45,240
Do you use a particular
mediumistic incantation?

227
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:46,444
Yes.

228
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:16,073
I've tried to revive her but
she disappears like a phantom.

229
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,435
Because the spirit has no flesh.

230
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:22,014
Her consciousness is intact
but her body is long gone.

231
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:23,816
Then I can't?

232
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:28,752
When you don't have the body,
you provide a substitute.

233
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:30,055
For instance...

234
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,686
Here's something that could
replace the body.

235
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:38,094
A soulless but mobile doll.

236
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:43,433
If I could recall the spirit
and plant it on the doll!

237
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:45,894
Yes, but...

238
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:49,965
It is only a substitute,
the spirit won't live long.

239
00:20:51,078 --> 00:20:52,409
Besides, Yuki...

240
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:58,382
One wrong move, and your own
soul could be taken.

241
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:02,748
I don't care.

242
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:05,348
Humor my one and only wish, please.

243
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:11,461
A living and vital ghost.

244
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:13,658
Thy name is nothingness.

245
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:17,797
Out of nothingness cometh
nothingness.

246
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:23,466
However, nothingness hath life.

247
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:30,141
By forces yet unseen,
I shall bestow life in thee.

248
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:33,083
Non cogito, ergo non cogito.

249
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:35,817
Non sum, ergo non sum.

250
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:10,056
How much longer must thou
sleep on a lotus a bed?

251
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:12,920
The evening of the Sabbath
hath now expired.

252
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:17,288
The dead, raise thyself slowly,
as it is thy wish.

253
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:20,766
Dear dream!

254
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:23,094
Dear dream.

255
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:28,064
How much longer will thou sleep
on the bed of nirvana?

256
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:31,242
The banquet of Sabbath
is all but through.

257
00:22:31,912 --> 00:22:38,875
The Devil, raise thyself slowly,
as it is thy wish.

258
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:44,218
Dear dream.

259
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:10,843
Do you recognize me?

260
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:14,019
Wake up! Say your name!

261
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:17,150
Rika Ikeda.

262
00:23:19,727 --> 00:23:22,594
Do you recognize the name
"Amakusa Hans" Aiko?

263
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:26,659
"Amakusa Hans" Aiko...

264
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,258
St. Michaela Female Crusade...

265
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:35,632
Aiko!!

266
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:38,269
Aiko Mimura!

267
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:48,216
Daisuke!!

268
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:55,726
I want to see her!

269
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:58,263
I want to see Aiko!!

270
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:05,162
Oh, no! Calm her down, Yayoi!

271
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:05,966
Yes!

272
00:24:19,286 --> 00:24:22,346
Aiko Mimura... Daisuke...

273
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:24,815
It was not a mistake.

274
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:28,090
My memory was not mistaken.

275
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:33,330
Aiko...

276
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:37,235
Yuki, what are you conniving?

277
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:39,597
I want to recover the lost memory.

278
00:24:39,707 --> 00:24:42,369
No, I want to know the truth!

279
00:24:42,476 --> 00:24:43,272
You mustn't!

280
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:46,972
You said to remember
what I don't want to see.

281
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:50,744
I would give up my soul for it!

282
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:55,320
But...

283
00:24:58,292 --> 00:25:00,692
When do I surrender my soul?

284
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:05,526
"Time, be still.
You are beautiful."

285
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:08,364
The moment you feel that way.

286
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,028
Time, be still.
You are beautiful.

287
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:16,339
But I won't let you! Yayoi.

288
00:25:16,443 --> 00:25:17,375
Yes!

289
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:20,178
Wait!

290
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:43,665
What an evil-natured woman...

291
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:49,031
What you wish to know
and are afraid to remember.

292
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:52,112
What lies in the turmoil
of conflicting emotions.

293
00:25:52,446 --> 00:25:54,914
It is the other history.

294
00:25:55,783 --> 00:25:57,307
The other history?

295
00:25:57,985 --> 00:26:00,613
This time, you'll have
to fight me.

296
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,259
You know the other history.

297
00:26:12,232 --> 00:26:15,395
Please tell me what really happened.

298
00:26:31,318 --> 00:26:33,286
Please answer me, Old Sage.

299
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:11,449
Gotten old.

300
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:25,501
Rika Ikeda...

301
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:32,104
Rika Ikeda, can you hear me?

302
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:36,839
Rika Ikeda,
do you recognize me?

303
00:27:41,255 --> 00:27:42,017
Yes...

304
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:52,031
Kozue, what's on your mind?

305
00:27:52,232 --> 00:27:54,496
The same thing that's on
yours, probably.

306
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:55,693
What?

307
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:58,269
That our mission isn't over yet.

308
00:27:59,006 --> 00:28:01,634
When we revolted at
St. Michaela's...

309
00:28:01,742 --> 00:28:04,836
...our plan was to take the time
tunnel in the chapel...

310
00:28:04,945 --> 00:28:08,346
...in order to help Hans save
his fellow crusaders, no?

311
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:11,479
Back to Rome in 1212?

312
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:14,553
No can do. Aiko's still recovering.

313
00:28:14,788 --> 00:28:18,121
I know that. She's spent.

314
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:20,284
We can let her rest awhile.

315
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:21,588
You mean?

316
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:24,689
We can go without her.

317
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:27,965
Kozue, don't forget
Aiko is Hans.

318
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:30,901
What do you mean
"we can go without her"?

319
00:28:31,305 --> 00:28:34,536
The St. Michaela Crusade has
already proven its worth...

320
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:36,734
...through the success against
the feudal government.

321
00:28:38,378 --> 00:28:40,778
I disagree.

322
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:42,473
I'm staying.

323
00:28:44,351 --> 00:28:47,252
Well, whoever wants to stay
should stay.

324
00:28:48,455 --> 00:28:50,650
I'll take my group with me.

325
00:29:01,134 --> 00:29:02,396
What's the matter, Mayumi?

326
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:04,904
It's about Kozue and her group...

327
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:05,994
What about Kozue?

328
00:29:06,106 --> 00:29:08,301
They left for Rome.

329
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,740
Rome?!

330
00:29:50,817 --> 00:29:51,511
Johann!

331
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:52,976
Johann!!

332
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,978
Pierre.

333
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:57,322
Johann!!

334
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:02,584
Hey, Pierre. I knew
you would volunteer, too.

335
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:05,929
I'm Marco.
Nice to meet you, Pierre.

336
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:07,131
Nice to meet you.

337
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:09,930
I'm gonna be the first to get
to the Holy Land, Jerusalem.

338
00:30:10,037 --> 00:30:12,267
Only if you can beat me.

339
00:30:12,406 --> 00:30:13,270
Pierre...

340
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:16,342
Isn't Hans with you guys?

341
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,473
He's the leader.

342
00:30:18,578 --> 00:30:22,309
He must've arrived ahead of us
to take direct orders...

343
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:23,474
...from the Pope.

344
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,177
He's the leader?!

345
00:30:27,054 --> 00:30:29,420
Among the men in all of
the Holy Roman Empire...

346
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:32,356
Hans is the most faithful, after all.

347
00:30:32,726 --> 00:30:33,658
Besides he's...

348
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,022
...also the most skilled!

349
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:41,132
Oh, let me introduce you to
Francois from the Frank Kingdom.

350
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:45,333
Hi, I'm Francois. I won't be
fazed by the male majority!

351
00:30:46,673 --> 00:30:48,470
She's a peppy one.

352
00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:52,736
I'd have to be, to enlist
in the Crusade.

353
00:30:53,747 --> 00:30:54,873
You're right.

354
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:05,747
My dear faithful.

355
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:09,955
On this very day, I am
overjoyed to receive you all.

356
00:31:10,063 --> 00:31:13,897
As you already know, there have
been many crusades to reclaim...

357
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,902
...Jerusalem, which has been
taken away from us...

358
00:31:18,004 --> 00:31:19,904
...by the Seljuk Turks.

359
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:24,033
The reason I have invited you
younger adults at this time...

360
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:26,635
...is because you are
righteous and pure.

361
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:30,205
That is, you are angels who
have been blessed...

362
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:31,784
...with the grace of God.

363
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,751
Older adults have failed to
take back the Holy Land.

364
00:31:36,857 --> 00:31:37,881
But, not you!

365
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:42,291
You are angels, therefore
God's servants.

366
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:47,095
To prove it, you have wings
on your backs.

367
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:51,403
Those with little faith may miss
them, but I can see them!

368
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:54,736
This Crusade is certain
to succeed!

369
00:31:54,841 --> 00:31:57,935
Go directly to Marseilles!

370
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:02,676
Marseilles gives way to
the Mediterranean Sea.

371
00:32:02,783 --> 00:32:07,083
There, your virtuous prayers
will be answered by God...

372
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:10,088
...and the sea will part.

373
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,886
Just as the Red Sea did
for Moses.

374
00:32:17,497 --> 00:32:18,828
Do not have fear.

375
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:20,126
The Lord is with you.

376
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:24,294
The parted sea will lead to
the Holy Land, Jerusalem.

377
00:32:24,404 --> 00:32:26,338
It will guide you all.

378
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:31,205
Now, I will introduce you
to your leader...

379
00:32:32,012 --> 00:32:33,809
...Hans Heilner!!

380
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:50,656
- That's our Hans!
- Hey, Hans.

381
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:53,062
- That's Hans?
- Our leader.

382
00:32:56,203 --> 00:33:00,469
The Lord will always watch over us.

383
00:33:00,574 --> 00:33:03,338
Together, we shall win
the holy war!

384
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,543
Together, we shall win
the holy war!!

385
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:09,715
In the name of Love and
the Holy Ghost...

386
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:12,341
...may glory be with the Crusade!

387
00:33:15,822 --> 00:33:18,188
May glory be with the Crusade!!

388
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:29,202
Someone named Gonza wants
to see Aiko.

389
00:33:29,903 --> 00:33:31,131
It's been awhile.

390
00:33:31,905 --> 00:33:33,668
What brings you here, Gonza?

391
00:33:33,907 --> 00:33:36,341
Yuki seems to have awakened.

392
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:38,371
She has?

393
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:40,443
Has she been here?

394
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:41,172
No.

395
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:43,374
I can't find her.

396
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:45,883
I thought she'd definitely
end up on this side...

397
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,888
Where could she possibly?

398
00:33:49,723 --> 00:33:50,655
I'll be damned!

399
00:33:51,424 --> 00:33:52,356
You know?

400
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,228
Kozue's group is in danger!

401
00:33:56,963 --> 00:33:58,396
Prepare to leave!

402
00:33:59,199 --> 00:33:59,858
Aiko?

403
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:01,524
Get everyone ready!

404
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:04,403
We're charging into
the Holy Roman Empire!!

405
00:34:37,637 --> 00:34:38,262
Oh?

406
00:34:38,972 --> 00:34:39,939
Rika.

407
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:43,066
You'd better keep up, Misayo.

408
00:34:43,877 --> 00:34:45,902
It's Rika. Rika!

409
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:48,845
No way. In Amakusa, she...

410
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,576
But, look!

411
00:34:51,985 --> 00:34:54,818
Rika!! You were alive!!

412
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:02,794
When I came to, I was being
looked after by a fisherman.

413
00:35:02,896 --> 00:35:05,262
That's why we couldn't find you.

414
00:35:05,365 --> 00:35:09,062
It was a deadly war.
There were bodies everywhere.

415
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:10,864
Hard to tell who was who.

416
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:15,203
But, I'm so glad to see you.

417
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:18,010
Sorry I caused you such trouble.

418
00:35:18,678 --> 00:35:20,509
But, how did you get here?

419
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:24,917
Yeah, how did you get here?

420
00:35:27,187 --> 00:35:29,951
I heard you took the time
tunnel from Amakusa...

421
00:35:30,056 --> 00:35:32,490
...and overthrew the feudal
government.

422
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:34,651
So, I knew that Aiko...

423
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:39,892
...or rather, Hans would bring
you here to save his fellows.

424
00:35:41,868 --> 00:35:43,802
Sharp thinking as usual, Rika.

425
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:46,171
With Rika, we're unbeatable.

426
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,265
What a boost to our morale!

427
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:51,401
Absolutely!

428
00:35:55,048 --> 00:35:56,675
Did you see Aiko Mimura?

429
00:35:57,484 --> 00:35:58,951
She's not there.

430
00:35:59,052 --> 00:36:00,019
She's not?

431
00:36:00,387 --> 00:36:04,346
But Kozue Takemiya and her group
are headed toward the Vatican.

432
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:06,721
They are planning to join
the Crusade.

433
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:09,553
I knew it! That's why.

434
00:36:10,296 --> 00:36:11,354
What do you mean?

435
00:36:12,365 --> 00:36:15,391
If I put together your story
and what I know...

436
00:36:15,502 --> 00:36:18,300
the Amakusa Restoration impacted
the whole world...

437
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:23,001
because Aiko was Hans Heilner,
the leader of the Crusade.

438
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:26,971
The World Restoration must have
been led by the students...

439
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,547
...of St. Michaela's.

440
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:30,047
Miss Yuki...

441
00:36:33,553 --> 00:36:34,542
What?

442
00:36:35,288 --> 00:36:37,518
Why do you obsess about
these things?

443
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:42,694
You need only do as I say.

444
00:36:42,796 --> 00:36:44,229
- But...
- BUT?!

445
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,925
Rika Ikeda! You've died once,
have you not?

446
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:51,902
Don't forget you owe me
for reviving you!

447
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:53,537
Yes, ma'am.

448
00:36:54,374 --> 00:36:57,036
Your second life won't last
very long.

449
00:36:57,143 --> 00:37:01,136
When your mission is complete,
I'll allow you to live freely.

450
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:06,079
I shall infiltrate the Crusade
as one of the soldiers.

451
00:37:06,186 --> 00:37:09,087
You stay with the students
of St. Michaela's.

452
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:13,153
Everything is my fault for leaving
it up to Daisuke.

453
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:16,092
If I myself had fought,
we wouldn't have lost the war.

454
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:18,090
Daisuke?

455
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:43,622
Miss Yuki?

456
00:37:52,098 --> 00:37:53,429
I am Aaron.

457
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:56,627
I am a soldier of the Crusade,
Aaron.

458
00:37:57,537 --> 00:37:58,526
Aaron?

459
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:27,099
Everyone, we finally make
our departure tomorrow.

460
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,168
It is imperative that
you act responsibly!

461
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:32,636
I've already relayed your order.
Don't worry!

462
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:34,238
Hey...

463
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:37,339
Looking like a real leader, Hans.

464
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,737
I've been trusted with the duty
to bring every last one of you...

465
00:38:41,848 --> 00:38:43,475
...to the Holy Land ofJerusalem.

466
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:45,980
Hans, did you know?

467
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:48,883
We've been joined by a support
troop from Japan today?

468
00:38:48,988 --> 00:38:49,886
A support troop?

469
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:53,015
They say they're students of
St. Michaela's College.

470
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:54,616
All female, to boot!

471
00:38:54,861 --> 00:38:57,989
All female?
Must be a courageous bunch.

472
00:38:58,097 --> 00:38:59,394
Where's Japan?

473
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:01,631
It's an island in the Orient,
they say.

474
00:39:02,635 --> 00:39:04,899
I see... Is it farther than Mongolia?

475
00:39:05,438 --> 00:39:06,530
Come to think of it...

476
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,632
The one who came here yesterday
is also from Japan, isn't she?

477
00:39:13,313 --> 00:39:14,405
Excuse me.

478
00:39:14,781 --> 00:39:16,749
I'm Rika Ikeda, from Japan.

479
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,743
I'm Hans Heilner. How do you do?

480
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:29,021
Hans... You are Hans.

481
00:39:29,796 --> 00:39:33,163
But, right now, you don't
know me yet.

482
00:39:36,135 --> 00:39:36,829
Rika!

483
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,994
You're here already.

484
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:39,935
Hi there.

485
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:42,439
We got separated on the way.
We were worried.

486
00:39:43,009 --> 00:39:45,204
I knew we would find you here.

487
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:46,778
Just as you said, Kozue.

488
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,249
Allow me to introduce you
to my friends.

489
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,683
This is their leader, Hans...
Hans Heilner.

490
00:39:56,689 --> 00:39:58,088
That's Hans.

491
00:39:58,191 --> 00:40:00,455
The Hans before he came
to St. Michaela's.

492
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,619
The Hans who doesn't know us.

493
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,759
Well... so you are Hans.

494
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:07,059
Wow!

495
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,899
You know Hans?!

496
00:40:09,002 --> 00:40:10,333
That's incredible!

497
00:40:10,436 --> 00:40:13,496
The word about Hans has
reached the Orient!

498
00:40:13,606 --> 00:40:15,574
Oh, I'm Michel.

499
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:16,767
Pierre.

500
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:17,774
Johann.

501
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:19,367
And Marco. Nice to meet you.

502
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:21,442
I'm Kozue Takemiya.

503
00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:24,614
Kumi Aoike.

504
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:26,446
Misayo Hagio.

505
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:27,649
Watoko Yamato.

506
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:30,216
Welcome to a faraway land.

507
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:32,089
I must tell you...

508
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:36,458
We have come all this way
with the intent...

509
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:39,554
...to dissuade you from going
to Jerusalem.

510
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:42,829
On the contrary, you shouldn't
even go to Marseilles.

511
00:40:44,404 --> 00:40:45,302
Why?!

512
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:56,306
It's a long, long way to
Marseilles.

513
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:58,941
You would be faced with fever
and disasters.

514
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:02,914
Nonsense! We have accepted
those challenges!

515
00:41:03,022 --> 00:41:04,717
Hardship is the path
we've chosen.

516
00:41:04,824 --> 00:41:06,792
Suffering is the Way of the Lord.

517
00:41:06,893 --> 00:41:08,155
It's the way of Love.

518
00:41:10,563 --> 00:41:12,793
Do you support us or not?

519
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:13,866
We do.

520
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:14,956
Then, why?

521
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:18,629
If you insist on going, we'd go
with you, of course...

522
00:41:19,706 --> 00:41:22,334
What are you trying to say?

523
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:25,738
Right now, this is all
we can tell you.

524
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:28,178
Excuse us.

525
00:41:32,151 --> 00:41:33,482
Go figure.

526
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:35,076
Some support troop.

527
00:41:36,923 --> 00:41:39,824
Aren't you going with
your fellows?

528
00:41:39,926 --> 00:41:41,154
Well, no.

529
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:44,289
What could they be thinking?

530
00:41:45,565 --> 00:41:47,192
Do you know?

531
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,064
Yes. Well, no...

532
00:42:19,565 --> 00:42:20,759
Who's there?

533
00:42:23,036 --> 00:42:24,128
My name is Aaron.

534
00:42:24,904 --> 00:42:27,304
I've enlisted in the Crusade.

535
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:30,742
I have something very important
to tell Your Holiness.

536
00:42:32,578 --> 00:42:33,738
Come in.

537
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,413
What is it you want to tell me?

538
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:49,184
Will you please trust me?

539
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:56,695
I'd have to hear you first.

540
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:14,544
I shall offer my body to you
so that you could trust me.

541
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:21,126
You...

542
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:25,931
You are!

543
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:29,128
An androgyny!!

544
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,938
"An eye for an eye" is one of
the heathen sayings, naturally.

545
00:43:35,575 --> 00:43:38,100
But I find myself up against
vicious treacheries...

546
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:40,042
...of the Devil's own
androgynous servant.

547
00:43:40,513 --> 00:43:41,775
The Devil's servant?

548
00:43:41,881 --> 00:43:45,977
The Devil is coming to hinder
the expedition of the Crusade.

549
00:43:46,419 --> 00:43:50,355
No matter what happens, you
must get them to Jerusalem.

550
00:43:50,456 --> 00:43:53,357
Or, at least, to Marseilles.

551
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,592
For your own good...

552
00:43:55,695 --> 00:43:58,027
What exactly do you know?!

553
00:43:58,131 --> 00:43:59,894
Everything!

554
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:04,493
That is why I am offering
my body to you.

555
00:44:05,104 --> 00:44:08,596
What do you take me, the Pope...

556
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:09,902
I...

557
00:44:17,116 --> 00:44:20,347
I know all about your secret
interest, Your Holiness.

558
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:24,913
My lips are sealed.

559
00:44:25,024 --> 00:44:28,050
So, please, enjoy my body
to your heart's content.

560
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:29,788
My life is on the line.

561
00:44:29,896 --> 00:44:32,296
The end justifies the means.

562
00:44:35,134 --> 00:44:37,762
I trust you... trust you...

563
00:44:44,644 --> 00:44:46,544
Even if I have to discard
this body of mine...

564
00:44:46,646 --> 00:44:50,446
I shall consummate my true love.

565
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:53,315
Daisuke...

566
00:44:53,419 --> 00:44:57,253
I promise you I will bury
all the Aiko Mimuras...

567
00:44:57,356 --> 00:44:59,324
...of the world.

568
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:02,892
Yuki!

569
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:04,986
I won't let you have your way!

570
00:45:09,402 --> 00:45:11,233
Marco and his fellows...

571
00:45:11,337 --> 00:45:13,100
And our own St. Michaela's
fellows...

572
00:45:13,206 --> 00:45:16,266
I won't let them be sold
to slave traders!!

573
00:45:16,943 --> 00:45:20,379
Let's go, everyone,
to the Holy Roman Empire!!

574
00:45:21,514 --> 00:45:22,481
Yeah!

575
00:45:24,717 --> 00:45:28,847
As long as I... and Hans... can
escape death by you...

576
00:45:28,955 --> 00:45:31,423
...for the sake of this world
I have built...

577
00:45:31,524 --> 00:45:33,515
I declare war, Yuki!
