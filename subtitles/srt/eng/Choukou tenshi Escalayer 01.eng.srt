1
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:13,609
It was our first reunion.

2
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,382
How are you doing?
Are you getting hot?

3
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,552
I think your body is
more honest than mine is.

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,918
Don't say that. You're so mean!

5
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,597
Sayuka Koenji

6
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,602
What the hell is that?

7
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,040
No, don't stop doing it.

8
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,373
Oh, okay.

9
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,130
Oh, my god!
What is he doing?

10
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,799
Beat Angel Escalayer

11
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:54,847
A tiny little thing can
make me happy everyday.

12
00:01:55,081 --> 00:02:01,850
I am scared that I might
not have it tomorrow.

13
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:08,859
First love is forever.

14
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:15,830
Is it okay to dream that
my wish will come true?

15
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:23,003
When your finger touches my heart...

16
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:29,873
...my heart beats faster.
Escalation!

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,383
I can feel hot energy in my body.

18
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:42,425
To protect the green planet,
my heart beats stronger.

19
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:49,535
I awaken the power to defeat evil.

20
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:56,303
I can be stronger,
to protect someone I love.

21
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:07,110
I will hold the sword
of courage, I love you.

22
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:24,263
Episode One: Doki Doki
Dynamo, Charge Complete!

23
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,111
What is that?

24
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,557
It was 9:04 AM...

25
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,984
That's right!

26
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,134
Sayuka, you're home.

27
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,040
I'm home.

28
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,376
S-Sayuka?

29
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,279
Is she back in town?

30
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,148
Oh, this is so great!

31
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,762
Is that really Sayuka?

32
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,224
Sayuka, can I talk to you for a minute?

33
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,629
What is it?

34
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,202
We are going to charge
the Doki-Doki Dynamo.

35
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,708
Is that all right with you?

36
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,271
Oh, okay.

37
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,609
Please sit down and make
yourself comfortable.

38
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,149
Excuse me, may I?

39
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,451
How are you feeling?

40
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,826
Are you starting to feel good?

41
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,133
If you don't answer me, I'll do this...

42
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,665
No...

43
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,703
Not there.

44
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:16,008
You can't just get off now.
Remember, you must be very excited.

45
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,784
It's easy for you to say, but...

46
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,434
Sayuka...

47
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,731
Sayuka, finally you are mine alone.

48
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,840
Madoka.

49
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,290
Ah, no.

50
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:06,328
No, Madoka, I can't do this with a girl!

51
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,231
It didn't work, did it?

52
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,734
No...

53
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,739
Do you think we're in a slump?

54
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,181
It seems that I cannot
satisfy you anymore.

55
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,721
That's why we need your
help, Mr. Kyohei Yanase.

56
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,155
Would you please do it?

57
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,856
M-Me?

58
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,545
Oh, hi, Sayuka. It's been a long time!

59
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,849
Do I know you?

60
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,158
It's me, Kyohei Yanase.
You used to call me Kyo.

61
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,958
L-I don't know you.

62
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,495
I guess I have to
explain everything to you.

63
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,606
Okay, so Sayuka's lost her
memory and become Escalayer...

64
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,609
...and what about that
Doki-Doki something?

65
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,076
The Doki-Doki Dynamo.

66
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,512
And you're saying you
want me to help charge it?

67
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,617
Yes.

68
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,551
Escalayer is the only person who
can prevent the invasion of Dielast.

69
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:39,522
However, charging the Doki-Doki
Dynamo, which is our energy source...

70
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,991
...has been getting difficult recently.

71
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,664
So you're saying that the feeling
of excitement is the energy source?

72
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,995
Of course, you become used
to stimulation after a while.

73
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,767
We don't have many choices left.

74
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,034
However...

75
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,374
...when she saw me, her
excitement level went up?

76
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,707
That's right.

77
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,783
I did some research
and checked your record.

78
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,478
After analyzing your body
and the way you treat girls...

79
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,578
...there is no one as perfect as you.

80
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,747
Then, you want me to sleep with
Sayuka?

81
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,587
That's right!

82
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,389
Give me a break!

83
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,790
Kyohei Yanase...

84
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,935
Am I going to have sex with him?

85
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,140
Sayuka.

86
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,357
No, what am I thinking?

87
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,355
But, doing such a thing here...

88
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,259
...it might not be so bad...

89
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,833
Do you wanna have sex with me that
much?

90
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,798
What are you talking about?

91
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,533
Wait, was I thinking out loud?

92
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,541
You were speaking out
loud, we heard you.

93
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,613
Anyway, forget it, I'm
not going to do this.

94
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:22,460
All right then, I will have to reveal
your secrets to your closest friends.

95
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,360
You know. The truth.

96
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,037
So tell me, what exactly
do you have in your hand?

97
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:41,110
This is the love letter that
you wrote to Sayuka 10 years ago.

98
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,139
It's not fair!

99
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,996
Oh, Kyohei. I'm really sorry
that I put you in this situation.

100
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,760
Do you really want
to have sex like this?

101
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:07,571
I wish we could start
over from the beginning...

102
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,904
...go on a date at an amusement park...

103
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,773
...and kiss each other
during the sunset.

104
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,873
Sayuka...

105
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,444
Um, it tickles...

106
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,213
You know, you're going
to feel hot very soon.

107
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,352
Aren't you always doing
this by yourself anyway?

108
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,281
No, please...

109
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,288
You really don't want to do this?

110
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,256
You better say something if
you don't want to do this.

111
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,226
Please, don't stop...

112
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,831
You are wearing cute panties.

113
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,905
Did you change for this?

114
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,902
No, I didn't...

115
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,606
You put them on for this, didn't you?

116
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,946
No, I didn't, but...

117
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,276
But, what?

118
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,116
You were waiting for this, huh?

119
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,622
You are a naughty girl, Sayuka.

120
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,467
You're wet.

121
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,737
That's not true! I
am not a naughty girl.

122
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,414
Ah, no.

123
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,185
Come on, spread your legs.

124
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,757
No, it's embarrassing.

125
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:40,587
Come on!

126
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,102
No.

127
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,654
I'm putting it in, so relax.

128
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,801
I'm scared, but...

129
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,912
The Doki-Doki Dynamo
has been fully charged.

130
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,609
Kyohei, please stop right away.

131
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,341
What are you talking about?

132
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,043
I can't stop now!

133
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,585
We have enough energy for today.

134
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,694
Thank you very much for your help.

135
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,854
Wait a second!

136
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,797
What am I supposed
to do with my dick?

137
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:02,002
I understand. I will help
discharge your semen then.

138
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,635
I can't believe Getten was defeated.

139
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:36,071
Now Escalayer has been
set as our top priority.

140
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,232
Yes...

141
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,906
What about the analysis
of the Doki-Doki Dynamo?

142
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:44,108
Oh, we still lack data.

143
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,081
Well, how about attacking
Escalayer and collecting the data?

144
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,951
I need to gather our followers.

145
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,994
Would you please follow the
instructions on this paper?

146
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,357
Let's see...

147
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,904
We'll go to the Merry-Go-Round,
Haunted House...

148
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,565
...and Ferris Wheel at night?

149
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,339
Yes. And can you hold
onto this for me, please?

150
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,039
Oh, you will be watching us, right?

151
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,011
Of course.

152
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,439
Oh, here she comes.

153
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,841
Please remember to keep smiling at her.

154
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,817
Sorry, I'm late!

155
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,539
Kyohei, you're not having fun?

156
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,368
Of course I am.

157
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,538
Why don't we go ride on that?

158
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:46,372
All right!

159
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:21,075
Dielast Monster: Joy-Frust

160
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,885
Are you scared?

161
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,514
N-No, I'm not.

162
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,994
I know you're lying. You are shaking.

163
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,160
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

164
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:52,200
Actually I'm scared to death, but if I
let him put his arms on my shoulders...

165
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,570
No! Stop!

166
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,639
There is no way that Madoka
will interrupt us here!

167
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,918
No, I don't want to think about it.

168
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,385
Hey, what are you doing there?

169
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,249
Oh, wait for me!

170
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,561
What's the matter?

171
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,188
I'm so scared...

172
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,771
What's that?

173
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,114
It's here.

174
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:48,293
This is supposed to be the last
spot, but we don't have any more time.

175
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,563
Please charge the Doki-Doki
Diynamo right here!

176
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,636
Wait, what do you mean?

177
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,708
Hey, wait...

178
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,117
Gosh, I don't understand this.

179
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:11,518
I am sorry I forced you to have sex
with me and to have a date with me...

180
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,087
Don't worry.

181
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,658
By the way, Sayuka...

182
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,053
Yes?

183
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,529
Suck it.

184
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,523
W-What?

185
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,528
Weren't you paying attention
to what she was saying?

186
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:30,196
We'll be dead if you don't
become a Escalayer and fight!

187
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,774
B-But...

188
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,976
Come on! Stop whining!

189
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,943
Y-Yes.

190
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,666
Lick around it.

191
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,100
Use your tongue.

192
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,477
That's right.

193
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,849
Okay, good.

194
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,086
Now, take off your clothes.

195
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,625
Let me help you.

196
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,238
Come on, show me your breasts.

197
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,972
Your nipples are really
hard, aren't they?

198
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,342
Are you already getting hot?

199
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,357
Feels good, doesn't it?

200
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,421
Yes. I am feeling good...

201
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,274
No...

202
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,909
You're wet, Sayuka.

203
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,578
N-No, I'm not...

204
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,657
Raise your legs up.

205
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,626
See? It's all wet.

206
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,869
No, don't lick there!

207
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,907
It's twitching.

208
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,317
Don't say that.

209
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,418
Please stop...

210
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,623
You don't like this?

211
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,757
Do you want me to stop?

212
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,331
No, you're mean!

213
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,635
I do like it.

214
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,171
Okay, you're a good girl.

215
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,605
Let me give you a reward.

216
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,172
Even though this isn't the
right place to have sex...

217
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,407
...but we have to do
it, to save the earth.

218
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,250
Thank you, Kyo.

219
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,771
I'm coming...

220
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:06,378
I'm coming!

221
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,427
To protect the green earth,
my heartbeats reach the sky.

222
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,028
I am Escalayer, here to beat the evil!

223
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,510
As long as I'm here, I
won't let anyone harm...

224
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,053
...this precious beautiful green earth!

225
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,855
What are you laughing at?

226
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,446
Sayuka, when the two heads attack
you...

227
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,921
...and the main body pauses,
please attack those heads!

228
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,593
Subliminal Escalation!

229
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,443
Dr. Arc isn't capable of making
anything good, it's all junk.

230
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,027
We failed to get the data, huh?

231
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,062
Not true, we did get something.

232
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,669
Dr. Arc, can we use FM77?

233
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:07,703
FM77?

234
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,806
That is still in preparation!

235
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,778
He means, we're just making
some minor adjustments to it.

236
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,316
Well, okay. I will
get it ready right away.

237
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,563
How is she?

238
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:37,398
She looked extremely tired to me, I
think she already decided to go to bed.

239
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,295
Okay.

240
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,997
Hey, robot girl, can
I ask you something?

241
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,165
My name is Madoka.

242
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,503
What is it?

243
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:48,244
She doesn't remember anything, right?

244
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:48,937
No.

245
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,505
But, when we were having
sex, she called me "Kyo."

246
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,016
What do you think it means?

247
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,081
I can't really say anything
about that right now.

248
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:02,616
But there could be some side effects
after charging the Doki-Doki Dynamo.

249
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,358
Her memory will come back if I
stimulate her, don't you think?

250
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:12,960
That's what I'm afraid
of... but it's only a guess.

251
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,002
Okay.

252
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:25,875
Now, the relationship between
Kyohei and me has begun.

253
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:32,557
But since I didn't know anything, I was
only thinking about our relationship.

254
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,158
But I understand that...

255
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:40,729
...being an Escalayer is the
only way to be with Kyohei.
