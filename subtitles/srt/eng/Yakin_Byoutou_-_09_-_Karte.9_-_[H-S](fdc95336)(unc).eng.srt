00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:39,392
<i>Night Shift Nurses</i>
<i>Episode 9</i>

2
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:46,631
She's currently living at home
after quitting the hospital.

3
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,300
She's getting married in half a year.

4
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,307
You don't have to investigate
any further on that...

5
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:00,979
What do you mean?

6
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,714
Is it because she's the daughter of the
Towtac pharmaceutical company chairman?

7
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,489
Are we being pressured by them?

8
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,054
It's an order. Don't say anything.

9
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,075
Wait! Please wait!

10
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,847
Why? Don't hold out on me now.

11
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:36,815
But...

12
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,223
Come on.

13
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,493
It may be a marriage that
our parents set up, but I'm really...

14
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,665
in love with you, Ako.

15
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:52,867
That's why...

16
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:21,099
Ryunosuke, do you really...
do you really love all of me?

17
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,727
O-Of course.

18
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,302
Float your hips up.

19
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,513
Huh? L-Like this?

20
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:44,014
You seem so quiet,
but you have a pretty wild side.

21
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,127
If it's like this,
our married life will be...

22
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,440
I-I'm going to cum.

23
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,801
Ako... I love you...

24
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,472
I... have a favor to ask of you.

25
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,712
What is it? Just ask.

26
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,314
Do you mind if we do it here?

27
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,245
Huh?

28
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:54,889
I'll do it first, and then
I want you to do it for me.

29
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,728
Huh? S-Sure... We're doing it here?

30
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,425
Of course, it's okay!

31
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,195
Then let me go first.

32
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,178
Even your farts are cute.

33
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,214
A-Ako?

34
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,245
W-What the hell is this?

35
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,049
Now I want to see you do it, Ryunosuke.

36
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,750
W-What kind of sick joke is this?

37
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,792
I'm being serious...

38
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:38,303
Your filth along with my filth.

39
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,237
I think that's real love.
Am I wrong?

40
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,005
W-Who cares!
I don't have any interest in that!

41
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:50,014
You... scat-loving freak! We're calling
off the engagement! We're done!

42
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,502
<i>Junichiro Fujisawa</i>

43
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:22,479
I don't agree that Ako Fujisawa
isn't somehow involved!

44
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,513
I know we're being pressured
by the brass, but that doesn't mean...

45
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,777
the daughter of the chairman
of a giant pharmaceutical company...

46
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,047
isn't involved!

47
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,484
I understand how you feel.

48
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,882
Then why?

49
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:35,358
It's impossible. And don't get misled.

50
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,191
Huh?

51
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,895
We're investigating only the case...

52
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,129
of Ren Nanase killing
Ryuji Hirasaka, that's all.

53
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,562
What we need is to establish motive.

54
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:46,465
But...

55
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,441
The case of Reimi Shinjyo was
unexpected,

56
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,711
but did we learn anything new
from Hikaru Kodama?

57
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,808
Well...

58
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,518
Besides, the only one who knows
Ryuji Hirasaka is Ren Nanase.

59
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,450
She's pregnant, you know.

60
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,547
What? Whose?

61
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,150
She won't tell us.

62
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:18,629
Huh? I thought I just
heard the mistress' voice.

63
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:39,455
Why... why does this feel so good...

64
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:46,598
Why... why is it, Doctor?

65
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,369
So good...

66
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:54,131
<i>This won't do at all!</i>
<i>Can't you even get this right?</i>

67
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,306
<i>I don't want to do it looking like this!</i>

68
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:01,838
<i>What's wrong with it?</i>
<i>Let's elaborate on the idea, then!</i>

69
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,916
Okay, here we go, Ako!

70
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:16,995
Ouch! It hurts, please let me down!
Put me down!

71
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:22,993
What are you saying?
This is just the beginning, Ako!

72
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:50,093
It hurts... It hurts. My body is
going to tear apart...

73
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,792
Please, put me down! Put me down!

74
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,391
Shut up! Maybe this will quiet you!

75
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,062
No! Please, put me down!

76
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:57,727
Here!

77
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,604
There!

78
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:17,783
What was that?

79
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,507
It hurts! My body hurts!
I don't like this!

80
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,036
- It hurts!
- What, it hurts that much?

81
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,015
Well, it's your fault
for not being clear!

82
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,550
Here!

83
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,425
How about this, doesn't this feel good?

84
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,725
It hurts! I'm going to be torn apart!
Put me down!

85
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,494
- Don't lie! It feels good, doesn't it?
- I'm cumming!

86
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,496
See, look at that! You felt so good
you couldn't help it!

87
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,882
Stop! Don't shake me! It hurts!

88
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:31,053
What are you saying? You just came!
You must be feeling great!

89
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:37,230
But... my body... My body is going
to tear apart! It hurts!

90
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:41,373
What a selfish woman! You get to
feel satisfied, but you won't...

91
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:46,401
let me get there, huh?
Pretty stuck up, even for a rich girl!

92
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,543
You want to cum again, don't you?
You stupid bitch!

93
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,140
I'm going to cum soon!

94
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:03,885
Me too, me too, I'm cumming!
I'm cumming! I'm cumming!

95
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,023
Your mouth!

96
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:28,803
Move your hand.

97
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:32,142
Ouch!

98
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,083
It burns! Please stop, Doctor!

99
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,779
This is disinfectant!

100
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:41,589
You going to leave those
open wounds for infection?

101
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:42,490
Doctor...

102
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:49,101
What if you were to
catch a cold, my sweet Ako...

103
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,332
Doctor...

104
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,699
Doctor! Doctor!

105
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,285
Mistress...

106
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,493
Why didn't you tell us
you were pregnant?

107
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:21,334
It's your body, and, being a nurse,
there's no way you...

108
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,596
couldn't have known about it.

109
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:28,603
This can't be good for the baby.
So, let's finish this investigation.

110
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:30,805
That day...

111
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,003
Huh?

112
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,981
The day I learned I was pregnant,
the Medical Bureau Chief was there.

113
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:40,944
The Medical Bureau Chief?
The one that committed suicide the day...

114
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,753
that Hirasaka fell off of the roof?

115
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,414
You mean, Narumi Jinguji?

116
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:45,888
What was she there for?

117
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:46,952
That day...

118
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,590
The day that I first started
having morning sickness...

119
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:40,371
I'm on night shift so, I'll be staying
there. How about you, Ren?

120
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,481
I'll clean up your room,
then go back to my dorm.

121
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:48,145
I see. Thanks a lot for doing that.

122
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,470
Is Hirasaka in?

123
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:15,509
Huh?

124
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:17,813
Y-You...

125
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,710
Are you all right?

126
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,587
Don't tell me you're...

127
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:29,817
Did I surprise you?

128
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:30,820
Yes...

129
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:35,558
I had no idea that you were
Dr. Hirasaka's classmate.

130
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:37,464
Umm...

131
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:38,466
What is it?

132
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,434
I was wondering what kind of
person the young Dr. Hirasaka was.

133
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:49,147
He hasn't changed. Before and now,
he's the exact same person.

134
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,814
Were you two going out?

135
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,441
With Hirasaka?

136
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:58,587
Of course not. He's too
unique and I could never keep up.

137
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,558
Although, you two seem
to be doing well.

138
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,096
So, what are you going to do?

139
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:05,993
Huh?

140
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:06,929
Will you have it?

141
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:12,868
I'm sorry.

142
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:25,112
That day... I didn't know
what the chief wanted to tell me...

143
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,918
Doctor...
What am I supposed to do from now on...

144
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:41,559
<i>Hirasaka Family</i>

145
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:45,367
Don't you even know that?
God, you are stupid!

146
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,430
I'm sorry...

147
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:52,071
Don't apologize all the time! It's
because of your family's connections...

148
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:57,072
that such a mousey bitch like
you can even work here! You get it?

149
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,246
But that's...

150
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:04,582
There it is again. You're the only
one who doesn't see it... So, then...

151
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:15,327
We'll use this to fix that mousey
disposition!

152
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:19,962
This will be a huge leap in character
impression experimentation too!

153
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,404
But that's...

154
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,237
Shut up!

155
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,108
Wait! Stop it! I'm afraid!

156
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:30,412
Quiet down! I have the electricity
turned down low. Don't worry!

157
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,974
No! Please!

158
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,246
Quiet!

159
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,018
Just like I thought! I just recalled
a school experiment where we...

160
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,962
ran a current through a frog's leg!
Your breast tissue is responding!

161
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,262
That just means that even
a busty hottie like you has muscle!

162
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:54,300
I wonder if this health care
tool can be used to relax muscles.

163
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:02,747
A very interesting idea...
Now then, how about here?

164
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:11,413
Oh! I knew you'd respond!
Okay! Let's make you feel even better!

165
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,940
You came!

166
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,309
I never thought I'd get such results!

167
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,713
I bet you're pretty sensitive now.

168
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,984
Okay, let's test it out!

169
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,454
Wow! Now, this is a very numbing
sensation. And these intermittent...

170
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:56,764
contractions just can't be
done by conscious movement.

171
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,313
Here I go!

172
00:19:55,561 --> 00:20:04,526
This was a very successful experiment.
So? Did we fix you yet, Ako?

173
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,301
Hey...

174
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,738
I-It's stopped!

175
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,957
Breathe, damn it!
Wake up, Ako! You idiot!

176
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,222
Shit! Charging 200!

177
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,024
C-Clear!

178
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,365
Shit! Again!

179
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,403
Damn, one more!

180
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,044
Hey! Wake up! Ako!

181
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,104
Doctor...

182
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:01,257
So, who is the father of your child?

183
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:05,061
Naoya Ohkawa, right?
You're covering for him, right?

184
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,795
You wouldn't even mistakenly
have one by Ryuji Hirasaka, right?

185
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,970
But, even if that's the case, then you
were a victim of rape by Hirasaka...

186
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,404
and got pregnant
against your will.

187
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,971
That's why you decided
that you would kill Hirasaka...

188
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,911
You're wrong!
The doctor never raped me!

189
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,674
You lie!

190
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:28,245
It's not a lie! The father of my
baby is the man I love, Ryuji Hirasaka!

191
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,916
Naoya Ohkawa sent this
through his manager.

192
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,356
<i>I know nothing</i>.

193
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:38,087
He says there's nothing
left for him to talk about.

194
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,126
I see...

195
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,898
Also, the reason behind the
suicide of Narumi Jinguji is unknown.

196
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:46,868
Also, I checked with old classmates
of Narumi Jinguji and Ryuji Hirasaka,

197
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:53,175
but all their mutual friends have
become successful and knew nothing.

198
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,548
<i>Living together with</i>
<i>a girl you trained</i>... <i>Isn't that cute</i>.

199
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:09,826
<i>That impudence</i>
<i>hasn't changed at all since back then</i>.

200
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:24,599
There's an acceptance party going on.
Do you want to come, Hirasaka?

201
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,638
We can all introduce ourselves, too.

202
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:38,149
To become a doctor,
we can't be just about studying.

203
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:42,051
We finally finished our entry exams,
so let's unwind a bit.

204
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:43,026
Q-Quit it!

205
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,428
Oh... I think I'll pass.

206
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,762
Oh, okay. Well, maybe next time.

207
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,609
<i>That was our first meeting</i>.

208
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,285
<i>He was a strange guy</i>.
<i>That's all I thought</i>...

209
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,983
<i>But, for some reason,</i>
<i>he was never far from my mind</i>.

210
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:15,427
<i>Hirasaka wasn't like the</i>
<i>other idiots who came to school</i>...

211
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,986
<i>to become a village doctor,</i>
<i>or to carry on the family practice</i>.

212
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:22,527
<i>And I was slowly beginning to</i>
<i>find him more and more interesting</i>.

213
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:26,294
Okay. Now, everyone watch closely.

214
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,974
This, and then this.

215
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,447
<i>This person truly wanted</i>
<i>to learn medicine, I thought</i>.

216
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,986
Hey, why did you decide
to become a doctor, Hirasaka?

217
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,361
Especially in gynecology...

218
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,459
Why do you ask that?

219
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:58,600
Just asking. Ah!
It must be because you like women!

220
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,264
I love women.

221
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,538
I knew it.

222
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,206
And I respect them a lot.

223
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:04,968
Huh?

224
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:08,174
Because all people were born
from women.

225
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,139
The history of the human race
was built by women.

226
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:17,516
I am in utter awe of a woman's
mysterious ability to create.

227
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,684
We have to hold these women
in high regard

228
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,188
That's why I decided
to pick gynecology.

229
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,932
I see. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to tease you.

230
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,593
I didn't think that you had thought
so much about it, Hirasaka.

231
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,302
I think she's a jumper!

232
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:38,603
Is she alive?

233
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:40,910
Hirasaka!

234
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:47,278
Hey, can you hear me? Someone!
Did someone call an ambulance?

235
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:48,950
Hey, are you okay?

236
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,550
<i>I couldn't do anything</i>...

237
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:03,130
Idiot... To throw away your own life
after you were born through...

238
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:08,735
such a miraculous joining of
a male seed and female egg...

239
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,835
<i>No matter how he looked, I thought that</i>
<i>this was the kind of person</i>...

240
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:15,711
<i>who really should be a doctor,</i>
<i>and I honestly respected him</i>.

241
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:20,946
<i>Even after that, Hirasaka never</i>
<i>showed up at any student parties,</i>

242
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,477
<i>and all he did was study</i>.

243
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:27,158
<i>Even when I was training,</i>
<i>I was with Hirasaka</i>.

244
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:32,553
<i>I don't know if this was a</i>
<i>coincidence or if it was fate</i>.

245
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,027
Good job today.

246
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:48,642
I'm completely wiped out.
How about you, Hirasaka?

247
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:54,680
I feel very complete.
It's best to be molded by experience.

248
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,755
How's your research? Is it progressing?

249
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,656
I'm focusing on characteristic
infection symptoms, which is okay...

250
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:08,130
But, pretty soon, I'm planning an
unrelated ultimate experiment.

251
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:11,867
Ultimate experiment? Sounds fun.

252
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,900
I'd love it if you would help me out.

253
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,903
Of course. Ask me anytime.

254
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:20,005
Thanks, I'd appreciate it!

255
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:37,253
<i>That night would be a turning point</i>
<i>for the rest of my life</i>...
