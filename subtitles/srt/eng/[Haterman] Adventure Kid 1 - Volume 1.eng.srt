1
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,150
I'll kill you, Jap!

2
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,630
Oh my God!

3
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:50,170
Supernatural Beast Battlefront
ADVENTURE KID

4
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,650
Sorry about the racket.

5
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,720
So, what's the game today?

6
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,120
Pacific war simulation.

7
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,480
You've got games
on the brain, Norikazu.

8
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,560
I did it!
Midori, I did it!

9
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,730
Boring...

10
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,460
Boring! Boring!

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,470
You perv! You were
looking at my panties!

12
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,560
White... I mean, I didn't see
anything! They aren't white!

13
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,550
Hey mister, you got
something buried here.

14
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,230
Oh great... I'm no good
with machines, anyway.

15
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,630
C'mon "Papa",
let's go in the house.

16
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,470
Hey! Norikazu?
NORIKAZU!

17
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,060
Oh, hi Dad. What's up?

18
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,140
Nice view. Very nice!

19
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,280
Oh, I'm so embarrassed!

20
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,490
You dirty little boy...
That feels so good!

21
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,500
Oh no!

22
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,270
Okay, that should do it.

23
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,800
I heard there used to be an
electronics lab around here.

24
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,780
The Masago Research Center
or something like that.

25
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:46,310
I bet there is more of this buried.
That's gonna slow our work down.

26
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,660
Masago Research Center, huh?

27
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,660
Well, Norikazu?

28
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,090
Just check this out!

29
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,530
C'mon, work...

30
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,030
Okay, there we go!

31
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,770
Oh, shit!

32
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,570
Norikazu!

33
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,640
Norikazu,
are you all right?

34
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,710
Norikazu...

35
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,980
A little numb, but I'm fine.

36
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,720
Are you sure?

37
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,860
Hey! What was
all that noise about?

38
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,690
Nothing, Dad!

39
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,250
Well, be careful out there.

40
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,060
- C'mon...
- Coming, love.

41
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,900
Sorry, Midori.

42
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,740
Don't worry about it.
I'd better get home.

43
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,340
I'll meet you later, then?

44
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,070
Sure.

45
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,420
"Papa... "

46
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,110
Here I come!

47
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,120
Harder!

48
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,460
Okay, how about THIS?

49
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,130
Oh "Papa",
you're fantastic!

50
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,560
No, I guess not.

51
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,400
Norikazu! Norikazu!

52
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,500
Are you alright,
Norikazu?

53
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,450
Huh?
What happened to me?

54
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,810
I heard you
yelling up here.

55
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,950
Don't you know I don't
like getting "interrupted"?!

56
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,020
Oh, SHIT!
Look at the time.

57
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,120
Gotta run!

58
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,690
Hey! Wait!

59
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,790
Nothing but trouble.

60
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,200
Hey...

61
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,840
We've got the house to
ourselves tonight, right?

62
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,070
Why don't we pick up
where we left off?

63
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,200
Way to go, Midori!
You're a champ!

64
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,470
I'm okay, I guess.

65
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,740
Alright, next target!
Let's look sharp, guys!

66
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,120
This game's the best!

67
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,760
That's probably why it's
the most popular right now.

68
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,530
But man, Midori!
You kicked some major ass tonight!

69
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,160
Thanks a lot.
You know, I'm really thirsty.

70
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,370
Alright then,
let's get something to drink!

71
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,970
What's going on?

72
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,730
This isn't the place, guys!

73
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,890
You dumbshit!

74
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,560
Are you alright, Kazu?

75
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,130
Norikazu!

76
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,600
What was that thing?

77
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,200
How the fuck should I know?

78
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,950
This thing's headed
for the roof!

79
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,010
It isn't stopping!

80
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,920
Kazuya, what is it?

81
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,700
Outside! OUTSIDE!

82
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,530
Outside?

83
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,600
Kazuya, what's going on?

84
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,370
Would you stop?
How should I know?!

85
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,440
Sue, come on!

86
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,390
Norikazu, you okay?

87
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,730
Norikazu,
I was so scared...

88
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,720
What was that?

89
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,230
Nori! Run for it!

90
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,740
Midori!

91
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,280
Help me!

92
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,950
God dammit...!

93
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,690
Nori, you're the mechanical genius.
Do something!

94
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,630
Are... Are you kidding?!
You call THAT a machine?!

95
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,930
Kazuya!

96
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,700
Let me go!

97
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,000
That fuckin'...!

98
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,400
Kazuya!

99
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,000
You monster!

100
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,530
Kazuya!

101
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,280
Stop it! Let me down!

102
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,990
Midori...

103
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,650
Norikazu, save me!

104
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,390
- Midori!
- Wait!

105
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,020
Don't just throw
your life away!

106
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,090
I've got an idea.
Come on!

107
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,790
Let me go!

108
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,500
Stop it! Stop it!

109
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,800
Stop...

110
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,410
Stop it!

111
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,080
Stop...

112
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,320
I'll give you something
to play with!

113
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,670
No more...

114
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,120
Well, I'd say we've had a
pretty crappy night, huh?

115
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,400
Too right.
But, how'd it happen?

116
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,890
Huh?

117
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,800
It just turned
on by itself!

118
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,170
Creepy!

119
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,510
Oh, please!
It's on a timer or something.

120
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,510
It doesn't have a timer.

121
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,570
Huh?!

122
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,530
I can't make heads or
tails of those numbers.

123
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,160
His brain's just wired
different from ours.

124
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,940
I'm getting something!

125
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,100
Help me!

126
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,170
Midori!

127
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,430
They're foreigners.
Where the hell are we?!

128
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,680
Dunno... It's like a
hospital, but not really...

129
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,350
Look, it's a tank!

130
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,950
Cool!

131
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,890
Wait... Where have
I seen that before...?

132
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,190
Relax! We're safe here,
no matter what!

133
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,960
Norikazu,
what's he saying?

134
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,300
"Where're you from and
what are you doing here?"

135
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,710
I was sorta hoping
he could tell us.

136
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,030
No!

137
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,470
What's he saying?!

138
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,020
Now's our chance!
Norikazu!

139
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,250
We're... We're in
the middle of a war...

140
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,090
Nori, snap out of it!

141
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,690
Come on and loosen these
ropes with your teeth!

142
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,730
Gotcha!

143
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,030
We've gotta find
Midori and Sue!

144
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,090
How can you
keep so calm?!

145
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,110
I'll kill you, Jap!

146
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,310
Oh my God!

147
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,870
Let's go,
while they're distracted.

148
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,910
Right.

149
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,850
At last I've found you,
Midori Asai.

150
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,530
Midori... Midori,
do you know this weirdo?

151
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,940
No! I've never
seen him before!

152
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,630
I'm not surprised
you don't know me.

153
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:14,010
But I'll make sure
you never forget me!

154
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,270
NO!

155
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,950
Norikazu, don't just
stop short like that!

156
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,960
I just heard
Midori's voice!

157
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,460
Come on!

158
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,900
Norikazu, wait a sec!

159
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,090
Now then, move aside.

160
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,570
What if I do?
Do I get to run away?

161
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,800
Ah, a girl with spirit.

162
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,280
Very well!
You alone may escape.

163
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,870
But what about these
other women here?

164
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,820
Please, you're after me, right?
Just let them go!

165
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,960
Midori, you're going
to get yourself killed!

166
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,490
But...!

167
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,420
Such a beautiful
friendship...

168
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,760
I despise people
with such feelings!

169
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,890
Sue!

170
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,600
Now then...
Your turn next.

171
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,330
Why you...!

172
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,570
Norikazu!

173
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,810
Midori!
Are you alright?

174
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,910
It was getting tight, but...

175
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,280
And like I WASN'T
in danger, too?!

176
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,050
Sorry!

177
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:34,020
You again... That's twice
you've gotten in my way.

178
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,630
But you won't
bother me ever again!

179
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,600
Look out!

180
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,950
Humans are so pathetic...

181
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,550
Norikazu! Norikazu!

182
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,950
Let me go!

183
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,060
Mi... do... ri...

184
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,040
Midori,
I love you.

185
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,090
I love you too,
Norikazu!

186
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,380
Now I remember. That officer
slashed me with his sword.

187
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,390
So, is this heaven?
Or is it hell?

188
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,190
Boy!

189
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,720
Welcome, Norikazu Hanyu.

190
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,790
Who are you?!
How do you know my name?!

191
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,900
You allowed me to see
your deepest thoughts.

192
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,370
My deepest thoughts...?

193
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,040
And how much you care
for the girl, Midori!

194
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,270
Midori? Where is she?
Where?!

195
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,940
This is a world
of my own creation.

196
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,380
All within this dimension
is decided by my will.

197
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,950
Even matters of
life and death...

198
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,750
So, am I dead?

199
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,120
If I am, can you
bring me back to life?!

200
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,930
Perhaps you are dead.
Perhaps not...

201
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,230
Then please, let me go
back there one more time!

202
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,430
And if you're killed again...?

203
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,440
I don't care! I just want to
save Midori from that monster!

204
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,410
Oh, so you care
for her that much?

205
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,180
Allow me to show you
something of interest...

206
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,280
Midori!

207
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,050
No! Get away!

208
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,110
Just where do you
think you can run?

209
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,130
There's no one left
to save you now!

210
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,190
Now then, let's get
a bit more intimate...

211
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,190
Kazuya!
Kazuya, speak to me!

212
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,130
Come!

213
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,690
No!

214
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,780
I'll give you pleasures beyond what
anyone of your world could know!

215
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,440
No... NO!
Somebody, help me!

216
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,720
Midori!

217
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:54,220
No... Stop it.
Stop...

218
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,900
Stop it. Please, stop...

219
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,140
You're quite well endowed
down there.

220
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,850
You're crying? Is this
really so painful for you?

221
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,590
I'll give you something
to REALLY cry about!

222
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,860
Growing quite well,
I see.

223
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:37,560
No... Stop it...
No more... Please...

224
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,880
Shit, he's gonna kill her!

225
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,940
Please, just send
me back to her!

226
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,120
Do you really care
for her that much?

227
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,780
I do! I love her!

228
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,530
Shall we proceed
to the main event?

229
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,410
No... ri... ka... zu...

230
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,170
Now then...

231
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,310
Lick it, and taste the depths
of your own degradation!

232
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,610
Now the fun truly begins.

233
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,700
No, don't!

234
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,340
I'll make a
real woman of you!

235
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,010
My little lovely...

236
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,280
Send me back!

237
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,310
Even if it means dying again?
After you were saved already?

238
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,850
If I don't save her,
who will? You?!

239
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,660
That I cannot do.

240
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,490
Then send me back!

241
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,430
She is fated to this destiny.

242
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,160
"Fated?"

243
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,230
The blood of Midori Asai
is already tainted.

244
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,300
What?!

245
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,310
She must atone...

246
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,310
Endless atonement in
this world I've created.

247
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,150
Then you're letting that
officer do this to her?!

248
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:37,660
Letting him?
I'm making him do it!

249
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,390
You son of a bitch!

250
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,320
You want to kill me?
Quite impossible.

251
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,490
In this world you're more
helpless than an ant!

252
00:26:53,710 --> 00:27:00,170
Stop it... No...
Stop it... Stop...

253
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,690
Make him stop! Please!

254
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,890
Do it and I'll stay here
and atone with her!

255
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,630
I think you're serious.

256
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,110
As much as you love her,
she may not be faithful.

257
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,440
Can you accept that?

258
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,380
Very well. Only because
you released me from N3-C.

259
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,120
N3-C... That was the...

260
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,020
You're Masago!

261
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,720
- My name is Suhiro Masago!
- I knew it!

262
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:58,000
Now, show me how far your
memories of her can carry you!

263
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,470
Now then, for the
piece de resistance...

264
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,360
You're still alive?

265
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,150
Wha-?!

266
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,530
You thought you could
defeat me with that?!

267
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,730
What's wrong?
Finished so soon?

268
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:37,000
You're just in time. Now,
watch as I violate your woman!

269
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,080
Oh god, stop it!
No... NO!

270
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,520
Stop it, please!

271
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,730
Norikazu Hanyu, are your
feelings for her so limited?

272
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,530
Are they really so weak?!

273
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,810
This girl is all
I could ever ask for.

274
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,940
Now, watch as
I bring her to climax!

275
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,540
Midori...

276
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,720
LET HER GO!

277
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,690
Norikazu! Norikazu!
Speak to me!

278
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,590
Midori!

279
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,570
Where the hell...

280
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,680
Oh please, how boring.
I hardly touched you.

281
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,050
So, where'd you come from?
You're kinda cute!

282
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,890
Don't act so shocked.
Hey, let's have some fun.

283
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,490
Whoa, hold it!

284
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,970
It won't be so bad...

285
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,640
There is no escape from me!
