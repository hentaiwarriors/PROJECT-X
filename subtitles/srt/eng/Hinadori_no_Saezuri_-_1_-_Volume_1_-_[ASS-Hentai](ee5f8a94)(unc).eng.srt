1
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,802
Carol, I've been thinking it's about time I
got you involved in the family business.

2
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,405
Oh, do you mean that, Father?

3
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,832
Yes. After all, by the
time he was your age...

4
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,738
...your oldest brother was already
running one of the companies

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,608
And? What will I be doing?

6
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:51,609
Right. That railroad
company I mentioned...

7
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,913
That one's a bit tricky.

8
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,987
I thought I'd put you in
charge of the takeover.

9
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,151
You're giving me such an important task?

10
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,688
I won't let you down, Father!

11
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,255
I know, I know you won't.

12
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,955
First of all...

13
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,756
...I'm going to send you
to a certain mansion...

14
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,626
A certain mansion... you say?

15
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,631
It's not just any mansion.

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:13,965
There was a time when it was...

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,304
...the symbol of the Burton
Railroad's Prosperity...

18
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,573
Now here's the deed to that mansion...

19
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,383
I wonder what's in store for me?

20
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:02,051
The allure of a glass doll
is its transparent beauty...

21
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,315
...and its fragile sensitivity.

22
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,651
All you have to do is dump
some cheap paint over it...

23
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,791
...and it's no more than a muddy troll.

24
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,429
One doesn't realize how beautiful...

25
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,231
...and fragile glass is until it's broken.

26
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,677
When the shards of the smashed
glass pierce your fingers...

27
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,478
...drawing a trickle of bright red blood...

28
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:35,954
...it's almost as if it's in atonement
towards the broken doll...

29
00:02:54,507 --> 00:03:05,076
MAIDEN OF DELIVERANCE
Episode 1

30
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,288
Good morning, Miss Clair!

31
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,629
Good morning, May!

32
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,995
I would've made the tea,
ma'am, if you'd only told me...

33
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,865
That's all right. I really
enjoy doing this myself.

34
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:24,896
Anyway, where's Foster?

35
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:33,806
Yes?

36
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,707
Oh, good morning, Miss Clair.

37
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,476
Good morning, Leese. Well?

38
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,251
How does it feel to put on
that maid's uniform again?

39
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,214
Oh, it brings back memories.

40
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,212
This place hasn't changed at all, has it?

41
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,889
Well, I'm going to be
counting on you again.

42
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,152
By the way, have you seen Foster?

43
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:48,458
No, ma'am...

44
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,623
Hmmm. That's too bad, I've
just made some tea for him...

45
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,728
Flora, you always seem to be
having so much fun when you work.

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,569
Yes, ma'am.

47
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,204
Even though it couldn't be less fun.

48
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,305
That's not true. It's a lot
of hard work, but it is fun.

49
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,242
Lily...

50
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,987
If only I had a bigger chest...

51
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:19,848
Who's there?

52
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,783
Emit! Could you run an errand for...

53
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,353
S-sorry!

54
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,261
Please wait a moment...

55
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,774
Monica, do you think
you can fix that clock?

56
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:39,669
Who knows...?

57
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,446
I'm surprised it survived the fire at all...

58
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,826
It doesn't look like it'll ever work again.

59
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,031
It's like time has stopped... isn't it?

60
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:00,899
Emit!

61
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,101
I beg of you! Foster, sir!

62
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,868
Please make love to me...

63
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:07,802
You're a bold one.

64
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,939
I'm surprised at myself.

65
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,668
I've never felt this way before.

66
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,844
I... I... have feelings for you, Mr. Foster...

67
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:19,742
Emit...

68
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,253
Forgive me...

69
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,248
Clair!

70
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:32,558
I'm sorry...

71
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,092
Miss Clair?

72
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:38,727
Clair!

73
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,430
Clair!

74
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:43,906
Are you angry?

75
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:51,912
No, not at all. You're kind
to all women, aren't you?

76
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:55,888
Well, if you don't need me...

77
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,209
Wow! You have to see this, Carol!

78
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,413
Be quiet, will you? Can't
you see that I'm thinking?

79
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,583
I'm very sorry...

80
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:39,490
What's going on?

81
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,131
What shall I do, sir?

82
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,026
Just open the gate for them, all right?

83
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,727
I want to speak with the
mistress of this house!

84
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,370
I'm sorry, but our mistress
does not see guests...

85
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,702
...without an appointment.

86
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,140
Oh, but I don't need an appointment!

87
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,880
Tell her that Carol Wellacuster
wants to speak with her!

88
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,816
I'm very sorry, ma'am,
but you'll have to leave.

89
00:06:59,419 --> 00:06:59,817
Excuse me!

90
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,284
Are you saying you're not familiar
with the name Wellacuster?

91
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,653
Of course, I know it very well.

92
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:10,125
After all, it's the name of the most
powerful conglomerate in these parts.

93
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,732
You're certainly the rudest
person I've ever met.

94
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,435
But then again, you're
certain to change your tune...

95
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,569
...once you lay your
eyes on this document...

96
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,537
Well? Now do you understand?

97
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,445
That I'm to be your new
mistress as of today?

98
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,841
It certainly looks that way...

99
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,451
If you wish to remain on
here, that's fine with me.

100
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,786
I'll hire you all, including the maids.

101
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,750
If that doesn't appeal to you, then I
suggest you take your leave at once.

102
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,691
Everyone, did you hear?

103
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,664
Yes, May told me.

104
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,993
We're just working for
someone else now, that's all.

105
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,697
It's got nothing to do with us maids...

106
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,640
How can you be so callous!

107
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,743
Hey, what do you think is going to happen?

108
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:05,783
Clair?

109
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,687
May has told me everything.

110
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,021
I was not equal to the task...

111
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,685
Oh, no. It's not your fault at all, Foster.

112
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,092
I want you to decide yourself
what you want to do.

113
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,930
Whether we should stay on... or...

114
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,867
This mansion is not particularly
well-built, you know...

115
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:31,909
Hmm?

116
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,604
Still, I have a very good view of
my mother's cherished garden...

117
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,981
Just a fragment of a memory for me now...

118
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,918
Surely they can't all be good memories...

119
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,821
But it's still better than
no memories at all...

120
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,054
If you stay here, it will
be very difficult for you.

121
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,223
Yes, but I'm no stranger to hardship.

122
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,089
Just a little longer...

123
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:55,900
What?

124
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,161
If you could persevere a little longer...

125
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,569
Foster...

126
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,442
The truth is... there might be something...

127
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,815
...even more valuable than
memories of the past...

128
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:18,880
Come in!

129
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:20,554
Pardon me, ma'am.

130
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,188
Foster, was it?

131
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:23,588
Yes, ma'am.

132
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,289
Well? Have you decided
what you're going to do?

133
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,496
If possible, we would like to remain here.

134
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:30,434
I see...

135
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,463
...then I shall have to forgive you
for your rudeness a while ago.

136
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:34,734
Thank you very much.

137
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,902
Don't just stand there,
Liz. Introduce yourself!

138
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:43,711
Oh, I'm sorry. My name
is Elizabeth Bergerac.

139
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,611
Please call me Liz.

140
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,308
My name is Foster.

141
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,145
Welcome, ma'am.

142
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,225
Pleasure...

143
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,093
I've already done a
background check on you.

144
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,199
I've decided I want you to train Liz.

145
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,668
Using your special techniques!

146
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,261
Carol?

147
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,167
Her father failed in a
business venture, you see.

148
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,376
That's why she's been sent to
me as an indentured servant!

149
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:14,707
What?

150
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,910
Liz, as of today I order you to
work in this mansion as a maid!

151
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,582
Carol!

152
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,415
Liz... as of now you are to call me "Miss"...

153
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,660
Carol... Wait, what are
you talking about, Carol?

154
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:34,227
You're not such an idiot that you have
to be told more than once, are you?

155
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,498
If you disobey me, your
parents will suffer greatly!

156
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,099
Yes... yes, Miss Carol...

157
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,677
What do you think? If
you want to stay here...

158
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,275
...you must show me
how obedient you are!

159
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,753
This is the only room in the
mansion that survived that fire...

160
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,655
To think that once again...

161
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,525
...these old wounds are
to be ripped open...

162
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,863
Miss Carol... what's going on?

163
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,429
Shut your mouth! Just keep walking!

164
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:23,107
All right, why don't you
show me what you can do?

165
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,643
Mr. Legendary Trainer!

166
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:26,549
Yes, ma'am.

167
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,031
Don't just stand there!
Hurry up, for God's sake!

168
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,537
There's no way for her to escape, anyway.

169
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:56,907
Liz!

170
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:57,977
It's all right.

171
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,459
I... I... I... I...

172
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:09,953
Is that the best you can do?

173
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,503
No! Stop!

174
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,873
It's easier to pluck their
feathers while they're alive.

175
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,406
Since all you have to do is...

176
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,579
...ignore the pain of the
person you're plucking...

177
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,679
You look lovely from here, Liz.

178
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,919
Let me give you a little present...

179
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,016
What is that?

180
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,257
An aphrodisiac from the Far East.

181
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,754
Stop it! Please, stop that!

182
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,433
It should start working
immediately. But first things first...

183
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,599
Don't use your teeth this time.

184
00:12:58,844 --> 00:12:59,606
That's right.

185
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,814
You've got to learn how
to use your tongue.

186
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,752
Well, now! This medicine of
yours is certainly effective!

187
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,089
She's positively drenched!

188
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,722
No, please, don't look.

189
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:21,689
I will do anything, so please don't do this.

190
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,065
What's that? What did you say?

191
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,002
Down there...

192
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,869
What's the matter, Liz?

193
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,442
You'll have to speak up!

194
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:38,072
Ahhh! I'm getting all hot down there...

195
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,475
...and I can't take it anymore!

196
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,388
Well, to think that a well-bred girl like
you would utter such vulgar words!

197
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,807
Open your eyes and watch!

198
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,148
N-no!!!

199
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,476
Don't close your eyes!

200
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,554
Unbelievable. I never thought
I'd see Liz in such a state.

201
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,158
S... Stop!

202
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,514
You'll have to cry out louder.

203
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,523
A loser has no choice...

204
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,199
...but to grovel at the feet of
her conqueror, just like that!

205
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,464
That's an age-old law
of the world we live in!

206
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,468
I want you to work on the other maids too.

207
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,178
You are to train them so that every
single one of them can entertain.

208
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,579
In return, I will pay them twice
what they've been getting till now.

209
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,039
You are to fire any maid
who can't pass muster.

210
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,276
Yes, ma'am, I understand.

211
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,248
Foster.

212
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:27,257
What is it?

213
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,650
I need to talk to you...

214
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,423
I'm sorry, but it'll have to wait till tomorrow.

215
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,861
I'm very busy right now.

216
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:35,960
Miss Clair...

217
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,001
You came at a bad time, didn't you?

218
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,372
You must go home tomorrow, Leese.

219
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:14,535
It's clear that this mansion
was confiscated unlawfully.

220
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:15,669
Just as I thought...

221
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,669
So, what would you like to do about it?

222
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,703
I'm going to reclaim this house.

223
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:22,577
Do you think it's possible?

224
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:23,571
Yes.

225
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,041
Yes. If you have about 4 pages of
documents I'm sure it won't be difficult.

226
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:28,647
However...

227
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,551
Judging by her personality...

228
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,720
...she'll probably take it back another way.

229
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,290
Yes. And if it comes to a pitched battle...

230
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,565
...it will require an
enormous sum of money.

231
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,365
Unfortunately, we don't
have the finances...

232
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,702
Still... there must be another way...

233
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,310
Good morning, Miss Carol.

234
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,944
It looks like you all decided to stay on.

235
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,751
That maid's uniform really
becomes you, Clair!

236
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,452
Thank you very much.

237
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,234
I have a favor to ask of you, Miss Carol.

238
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,472
My sister...

239
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,800
...Please don't do anything cruel
to my younger sister, Flora.

240
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,013
In return, I will do anything you wish.

241
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:33,442
Flora? Oh, you mean that short little girl.

242
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,919
You don't look like sisters, though...

243
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:42,457
Flora is my sister! My
only... she's my only...

244
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,356
Oh, well, I suppose it's all right.

245
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,756
But! Disobey me and the deal is off!

246
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:48,758
Do you understand?

247
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:51,461
No!

248
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,929
All right, then, shall I bring
in Flora to take your place?

249
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,603
You people are the scum of the earth!

250
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:03,740
Yes, but unfortunately, you must
bow your head to such scum.

251
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,117
I just have to do whatever you say, right?

252
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,387
Don't worry. I have no use for little girls.

253
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,618
All I'm interested in is
lascivious bitches. But!

254
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:16,917
Ouch!

255
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,597
I won't tolerate rebellious behavior.

256
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:20,990
Understood?

257
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,029
Yes.

258
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,225
Get down on your knees.

259
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:27,830
Put it in your mouth.

260
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,274
Don't forget to use your tongue, too!

261
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,450
Uhhh...

262
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,830
Drink every last drop!

263
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:10,042
As long as you pay me,
I'll follow any order...

264
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,873
All right, then open yourself
with your own fingers.

265
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:14,485
Yes, sir.

266
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,217
Is that all right, sir?

267
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,985
You'll do anything for money, won't you?

268
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,459
Then what about something like this?

269
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:33,799
Hot! Ow! Ow! Ahhhh!

270
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,511
Have you no shame?

271
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,077
I don't really find it all
that embarrassing, sir.

272
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,552
All right. Then put your
hands on that table...

273
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:48,720
...and get down on all fours!

274
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:49,351
Yes, sir.

275
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,387
You're submissive.

276
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,121
That's because I don't mind
doing anything for the one I love!

277
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:10,768
Sensitive, eh? Then how about... this?

278
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,301
That feels good too!

279
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,147
Foster sir!

280
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,763
This is ridiculous. The
rest is up to you, Foster.

281
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,011
Please don't!

282
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,681
Wasn't it your own decision to stay here?

283
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,183
Yes, but... I have no other place to go!

284
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,357
Ah! Please, please stop that!

285
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,761
So you can be feminine
sometimes, too, eh?

286
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,069
I can't take this anymore!

287
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:18,272
Just endure it. You'll get
used to it soon enough.

288
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,176
There's no way I'll ever get
used to something like this!

289
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,673
At the very least, you'll be able
to pretend you're used to it.

290
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,611
Enough with the words of compassion.

291
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:30,253
You're not being kind by offering
her comfort this one time!

292
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,113
You're working hard as usual, aren't you?

293
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:01,713
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,317
This tea is undrinkable!

295
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,116
L-I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

296
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,157
Really! You can't even make...

297
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,096
...a descent pot of tea!

298
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:11,463
Pardon me, miss...
...a descent pot of tea!

299
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:11,563
Pardon me, miss...

300
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,121
Have one of the other maids do it...

301
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,731
That's not the point!

302
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,295
If it's tea you want, I'll do it, ma'am.

303
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,133
Don't interfere! I'm talking to Liz here!

304
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,934
I know, ma'am, but there is
a knack to making good tea.

305
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,038
I don't really think that she'II...

306
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,236
...she'll suddenly get better at it
just because you shouted at her.

307
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:29,246
Clair!

308
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,549
Hmm! You dare to speak your mind to me?

309
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,411
Do you remember what your
position is in this household?

310
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,344
Of course I do, Miss Carol.

311
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,285
Foster, I want you to punish
this ill-mannered maid!

312
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,088
All right, I will speak to her harshly later.

313
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,591
That's not good enough!

314
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,988
I want you to rape her right here, right now!

315
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:48,922
What?

316
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,691
Well, what are you waiting for? Do it!

317
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,694
I don't think there's any need to do that.

318
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,303
You two are excused.

319
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,008
So you're defying me too, Foster?

320
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,214
No, but it's my responsibility
to discipline the maids.

321
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:19,925
Clair...

322
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,295
What's wrong?

323
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,199
Nothing, it's nothing.

324
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,499
There's really no use
in lashing out at Carol.

325
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,500
Leave me alone!

326
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,508
And don't forget this is what you wanted...

327
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:32,468
What I wanted?

328
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:39,415
I never... I never, ever wished
for something like this!

329
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,686
Calm down. You just
have to endure this now...

330
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,260
Do you think you can silence
a woman by kissing her?

331
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,029
Don't talk to me like that...

332
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,329
I'm tired of this! This kind of relationship!

333
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,767
And look at me... I do go
silent when I'm kissed.

334
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:09,313
Clair...

335
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:31,435
What was it... what in the
world was it that I wanted?
