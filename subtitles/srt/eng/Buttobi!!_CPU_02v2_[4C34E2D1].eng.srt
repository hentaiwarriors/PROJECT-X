1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,810
But Shimada's father
is really a big man.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,540
He gave her a complete computer set...

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,380
just because he
doesn't use it anymore.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,990
I'm very proud of my Father.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,720
But I'm not really
interested in computers.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,360
And Takaoka told me he wanted one.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,520
Yeah, I don't how
much to thank you Shimada.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,160
I really appreciate it.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,860
It's nothing, because...

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,600
I want to give
anything I can to Takaoka.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,130
Well, I don't mean that.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,540
There are things that would keep
their value if you keep it longer.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,170
That's true.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,910
You've got a heavy load.
I'll open the door.

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,250
Wait!

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,450
Oh, Akira! Do you have the key!

17
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,980
Welcome home. Master.

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,990
Oh, God!

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,660
Who are you?!

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,170
How do you do? I'm Mimi Takaoka.

21
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:23,090
Forgive me I keep you riding
on uneasy feelings all the time

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,760
Cause I wanna know
everything about you

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,820
My heart starts to
drive itself uncontrollably

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,130
More nervous than before
because I can't tell you

25
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,400
I have a desire to
love you more and more

26
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,270
But this emptiness is
the other side of love

27
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,440
Only if you take us
to a more extreme level

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,210
Your hot access

29
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,110
Is what I am really waiting for

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,680
Most likely I will
get you in more trouble

31
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,490
But please accept my wholeness

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,630
With my heart kept innocent like
I'm bare naked in front of you

33
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,470
As I stand close to you

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,170
Your hot access

35
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,310
Is what I'm longing for

36
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,380
Gentle Hang Up

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,690
Oh, did you grow up abroad?

38
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,060
Since you moved to Japan,
you'll transfer into our school.

39
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,080
Won't you?

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,130
Yeah, I guess so.

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,600
Then, can you join our
Electric Brain Study Club?

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,760
I'll think about it.

43
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,530
They'll be really surprised if they
found out she's a personal computer.

44
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,910
I didn't know Akira
had such a cute cousin.

45
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,110
She is different
from everybody else.

46
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,010
I guess it's because
she grew up abroad.

47
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,810
I really envy Akira.

48
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,680
He could live with such
a cute girl for a while.

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,050
You guys are talking
about Mimi all this time!

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,490
Weren't we supposed to come
here to look at the computer?!

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,750
What's wrong?

52
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,560
Why are you being
so cranky, Shimada?

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
By the way, Akira, what happened to
the computer you bought recently?

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,560
It's right here...

55
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,640
I sent it in for repairs!

56
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,870
Repair?

57
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,640
I suggest you repair
this primitive machine.

58
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,380
That's very rude!
My father was using it!

59
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,450
It may not the newest model,
but how can you say it's primitive.

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,650
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,790
Hey, don't be so hard, Shimada.
Mimi doesn't mean any harm.

62
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,560
I know that.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,430
By the way Mimi, which country were
you living in before you came here?

64
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,390
Well, up until I was sent
as a computer product...

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,560
Com...? What did you say?

66
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,140
Co... Colombia, Colombia!

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,430
Colombia?

68
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,840
In South America?

69
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,780
Yes!

70
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,610
It was South America, South America.

71
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,480
It must be difficult for you,
staying in Japan.

72
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,410
It was difficult there,
and difficult here.

73
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,820
It's really difficult.

74
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,760
I did it!

75
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,450
I cleared the stage!

76
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,590
Well! This time I'II...

77
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,620
It hung up.

78
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,400
What are you doing Mimi?

79
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,600
I was about to clear the next stage.

80
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,910
Because, you're ignoring me.

81
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,040
But I wanted to play this
game for a long time.

82
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,510
Why can't I play it
a little bit more?

83
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,610
Shimada is a really nice person.

84
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,980
Master, you are saying
Shimada, Shimada!

85
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,150
Do you like her so much?

86
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,410
No... it's not that.

87
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,120
Who's prettier Shimada or me?

88
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,550
Well... Mimi you're... much prettier...

89
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,360
than Shimada is.

90
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,400
Thank you Master.

91
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,710
How do you like that, Shimada?

92
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,110
Don't even try to seduce my master!

93
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,210
Hey! Say something!

94
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,370
Shimada.

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,040
Shimada is this computer?

96
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,820
Master, Shimada
is really unfriendly.

97
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,410
Let's train her how to behave.

98
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,990
You mean train the computer?

99
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,680
Yes.

100
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,250
Now, be a good girl!

101
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,230
Shimada!

102
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,290
Oh no! Stop, Mimi!
The computer will break.

103
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,000
Good morning, master.

104
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,700
Mimi... today is Sunday.

105
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,230
Let me sleep.

106
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,710
Look Master.

107
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,180
Wake up Shimada.

108
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,480
Voice activated computer start up!

109
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,810
How did you do this?!

110
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,910
I created a start-up recognition
batch file in the memory.

111
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,750
I turned the small built-in
speaker into a microphone.

112
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,460
First, I tried to make her to say
good morning or good night.

113
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,870
But she only has
640 KB of main memory.

114
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,940
Whoa...

115
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,500
But she's become much cuter.
Hasn't she, Master?

116
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,010
It sounds like you are teaching
a child how to behave.

117
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,440
Silly Master,
who's child would it be?

118
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,320
Master!

119
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:31,700
Please use me to
your heart's content.

120
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,200
Master!

121
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,000
Master!

122
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,010
Forte, how is your
project developing?

123
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,220
Based on the schedule,
it's about 80% completed.

124
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,150
If you weren't here,
I couldn't have hatched this plan.

125
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,090
I really appreciate your help.

126
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,160
I am very happy to
hear you praise me.

127
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,400
Master's happiness is
my own happiness.

128
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,170
l, NBC PC 2198 AZ, Forte.

129
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,440
I certainly will
meet your expectations.

130
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,440
Shimada.

131
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,270
Shall we go? Master.

132
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,710
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

133
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,680
But, I have to create my records
as Mimi Takaoka, a human...

134
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,880
who came from Colombia.

135
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,290
Like a social security
number and stuff.

136
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,220
Correct.

137
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,120
So then, let's gain access.

138
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,900
Where the hell are we?

139
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,440
A data space consisting
of simulation molecules.

140
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,240
It means we're inside a computer.

141
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,540
Inside a computer?

142
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,250
Are we?

143
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,680
Why are we naked?!

144
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,620
Because, right now I'm functioning
with just base memory.

145
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,990
You have to expand my memory
if you want to wear clothes.

146
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,360
You mean... we have to have sex?

147
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,430
My bio-program system can't
save active molecules...

148
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,910
for more than 72 hours.

149
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,870
Then to make Mimi run
at full performance...

150
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,840
we have to have sex
once every three days.

151
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,240
Master doesn't seem to like
to do installation work very much.

152
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,440
So I didn't tell you up until now.

153
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,540
Well, I...

154
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,080
It's not that I don't like...

155
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,590
Then shall we do it right now?!

156
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,890
No! Not now!

157
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,330
See! I knew you didn't like it!

158
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,560
I'm just saying... that's...

159
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,570
Anyway, going inside a
government database is a crime.

160
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,790
Let's finish the work and go home.

161
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,930
Master, you'll get lost
if you go by yourself!

162
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,010
Hey, Mimi.

163
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,580
What's taking you so long?

164
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,740
There are too many security
programs around here.

165
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,510
It's the government.

166
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,480
It must have as many security
programs as it has signatures.

167
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,580
Who are you?!

168
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,760
What's wrong, Mimi?

169
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,930
I... I'm being scanned.

170
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,860
Opponent machine is...

171
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,530
Mimi!

172
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,970
M... my data is being read!

173
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,140
This is my territory around here.

174
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,470
You won't get in
without my permission.

175
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,510
W... who are you?!

176
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,610
NBC PC 2198 AZ...

177
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,190
Forte!

178
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,090
PC 2198?

179
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,890
That means she is
same product as Mimi!

180
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,450
Why is she doing this?

181
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,760
Don't make me laugh.

182
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,630
I am AZ. The high-end machine.

183
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,130
Don't compare me with
a machine like the AX.

184
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,800
Oh no... your memory
is completely empty.

185
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,340
You're such an innocent baby.

186
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,200
Your owner doesn't
care much about you?

187
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,780
Or is his owner's level so low?

188
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,820
Wh... what?!

189
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,920
Oh crap... I look stupid
being naked like this.

190
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,010
It seems like somebody's been
wandering around here recently.

191
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,690
Girl, was it you?

192
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,420
No!

193
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,150
We came here for
the first time today.

194
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,490
It doesn't really matter.

195
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,830
Erasing intruders is my function.

196
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,770
Mimi!

197
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,840
Master! Don't come here!

198
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,400
B... but!

199
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,010
M... Master, you'll be all right.

200
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,940
When I'm erased,
you can go back to your room.

201
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,190
N... no way!

202
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,390
Master... even forjust a
short while, I was... happy.

203
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,920
M... Mimi!

204
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,520
Oh, such a beautiful relationship.

205
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,430
It makes me cry!

206
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,940
Mimi!!!

207
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,000
Now!!

208
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,770
Mimi! Mimi! Mimi!

209
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,380
Thank you, Master.

210
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,810
W... who is it?

211
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,790
What's going on?

212
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,320
An apple logo? Are you...?

213
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,320
Yes I am!

214
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,630
Like I said, the Japanese
bio-type is really unsophisticated.

215
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,400
And they don't have
any sense of taste.

216
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,270
Sister... can't you do something
with that Japanese font?

217
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,580
I'm the oldest of Nac three sisters,
Quadra Nackintosh 9000.

218
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,810
I am Centris Nackintosh 850.

219
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,450
N... Nackintosh?

220
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,290
More weird things keep showing up.

221
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,020
Who the hell are they?

222
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,770
American bio-type computers.

223
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,240
They don't have masters,
and operate by OS.

224
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,540
The one on the left,
model 9000 has...

225
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,710
1000 terabytes of huge hard disk
drive space in both of her breasts.

226
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,300
Her performance is...

227
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,610
Master!

228
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,180
You were the ones who were
accessing my work area.

229
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,520
I think Japanese bio-types
are stuck up, harsh...

230
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,550
and really unfriendly.

231
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,190
They're really annoying.

232
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,130
I will erase you two!

233
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,460
Yeah... let's get rid of them!

234
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,310
What?

235
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,180
It was so fast,
I couldn't see anything.

236
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,940
Your naked body looks really funny.

237
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,810
Sister... please give me
Japanese font recognition.

238
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,460
I don't really care.

239
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,360
Why don't you kill that girl?

240
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,700
Of course, I would
be happy to do that.

241
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,500
I was at a loss because, the data
space is too large to find you.

242
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,670
But you saved me the trouble
by working in this area.

243
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,670
I will take your data!

244
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,550
Oh, I didn't know you still had the
power to set up data protection.

245
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,760
Then I will let
you in on something.

246
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,460
Our goal is to dominate
the Japanese market.

247
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,630
Put simply, we want to get
rid of Japanese bio-type computers...

248
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,040
make USA #1 and
then will be very happy.

249
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,330
That's not simply put.

250
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,240
Dominate the Japanese market?

251
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,070
Here!

252
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,740
Now show me all your data!

253
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,420
Japanese data protection
systems are really cheesy.

254
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,930
S... shit!

255
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,970
Last protection level
is about to break!

256
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,390
Wait!

257
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,870
Let that person go, right now!

258
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,030
H... hey Mimi!

259
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,410
Well, well...

260
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,610
I didn't know there was another
Japanese bio-type machine here.

261
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,840
Look, the owner is
hanging out with her.

262
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,210
I have lots of room to eat him.

263
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,180
S... shit! Let's get out of here!

264
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,650
It's not that easy to escape.

265
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,520
You two will find it very
difficult to move in here.

266
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,750
Hey, Mimi!

267
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,730
Master.

268
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,120
We can'tjust leave AZ Forte here.

269
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,960
I will fight!

270
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,000
Mimi.

271
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,730
It's really so Japanese.
How dramatic.

272
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,440
It makes me cry!

273
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,530
What's so touching about it?

274
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,140
I only have memory
for two shots.

275
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,610
So I can't miss!

276
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,040
Too weak!

277
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,220
Oops!

278
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,060
Hey! Be more careful!

279
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,860
Sorry about that.

280
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,990
Master, take care of Forte!

281
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,130
I... I got it!

282
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,170
Oh well, this wasn't my plan,
but I will take the boy.

283
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,380
Master!

284
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,650
Hurting humans?!

285
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,150
What kinds of computers are you?!

286
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,720
No, No, No.

287
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,990
I would never hurt humans? Would I?

288
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,490
Don't act so innocent?!

289
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,430
You just did...

290
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,730
Master, what happened
to your stomach?

291
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,990
Well... I'm not hurt at all.

292
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,340
Oh, Master, how did your
installer become so big?

293
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,880
N... No! Mine is not like this...

294
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,910
Yes, that is for
Nac machine use only.

295
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,220
It's an erection power saver.

296
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,560
S... such a dirty name
for an application.

297
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,730
Well, let's install some fresh
Japanese fonts from this boy.

298
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,690
That's a nice idea.

299
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey, come on boy!

300
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,000
Let's install!

301
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,710
Master!

302
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,740
No!!!

303
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,380
Master!

304
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,450
How could you?!
Attacking your owner?!

305
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,850
What the hell are you doing?!

306
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,480
Sister.

307
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,010
What?

308
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,780
Well... I suggest you should
wear underwear properly.

309
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,150
Master! Master!

310
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,560
Are you all right?! Master!

311
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,490
I'm sorry, Master!

312
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,840
Master?

313
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,640
Mimi! Let's expand the memory!

314
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,980
Well then, I'll get him this time.

315
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,410
Master!

316
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,110
Centris!

317
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,590
Mimi!

318
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,160
Great!

319
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,420
Master, you're really strong today!

320
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,920
Sister!

321
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,330
That boy's installer has much
stronger power, because of the saver.

322
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,870
Why are we hiding?

323
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,800
I don't know.

324
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,570
Mimi!

325
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,780
Master!

326
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,320
I'm... so happy!

327
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,360
Memory expanded!
Equipped 6000 gigabytes!

328
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,050
OK!

329
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,220
Load armor device!

330
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,600
Set up...

331
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,840
completed!

332
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,710
Alright, you won't have
it so easy this time!

333
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,410
Beam attack version 4.0!

334
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,690
Run!

335
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,790
Acting perverted in front of others!

336
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,100
Don't you Japanese have any modesty?!

337
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,500
Prepare to die!

338
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,000
No, you prepare!

339
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,610
Dammit, sister!

340
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,710
Sorry about that!

341
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,510
I need more beam power!

342
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,850
If I had 600 kilobytes more...

343
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,480
I could use another version
of the beam attack!

344
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,960
Master, give me another
600 kilobytes of memory!

345
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,000
No way!

346
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,370
I'm spent!

347
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,280
Too bad!

348
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,680
Mimi!

349
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,060
Fo... Forte.

350
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,460
Are you a fool?

351
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,930
Either way, your
destiny is being erased.

352
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,630
This is a very beautiful friendship.

353
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,600
It makes me cry too.

354
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,570
Sister, please.

355
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,430
Come on, get it up!

356
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,700
I won't forgive you!

357
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,570
I won't! Nackintosh!!

358
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,310
Sister, it seems like she still
doesn't understand our real power.

359
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,750
She doesn't.

360
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,350
I will teach you
to fear American power!

361
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,590
Mimi!

362
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,290
Shimada! You're here!

363
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,320
Shimada? The personal computer?

364
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,770
Memory expanded!
600 kilobytes OK!

365
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,340
Centris!

366
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,470
OK!

367
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,340
Double Shield!

368
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,880
This game has been "ochazuke"! *
*(Green tea over rice)

369
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,890
Sister, it's pronounced "oazuke"*!
*(called off)

370
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,520
Sorry about that.

371
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,300
Well, I guess we're saved.

372
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,200
Yes... placing Shimada into
the virtual drive was a good idea.

373
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,000
Thank you Shimada.

374
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,400
You saved us.

375
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,270
Oh... are you all right?

376
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,780
I don't want to be friends with you.

377
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,910
But I owe you thanks.

378
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,410
AZ... Forte.

379
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,880
You... came here to make
your proof of existence?

380
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,990
I will take care of that.

381
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,660
So then we're even.

382
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,960
Yes.

383
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,670
You should never
come back here again.

384
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,190
I'm tired.

385
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,350
I'm sorry, I should have
gone there by myself.

386
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,860
W... what are you talking about!?

387
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,490
If you were alone,
right now you would be...

388
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,860
I don't even want to think about it.

389
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,700
Master.

390
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,430
But who is that girl, Forte.

391
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,040
I don't know anything about her.

392
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,080
Or about the Nacks, either.

393
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,470
I see.

394
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,250
Then it's not worth thinking about,
if you don't even know.

395
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,920
Hello, Takaoka residence.

396
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,060
Takaoka? This is Shimada.

397
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,630
Shimada?

398
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,360
Thank you! Thank you!
You really saved my life.

399
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,440
I... I just wanted to check
how the computer's working?

400
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,800
It's great!

401
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,770
Shimada saved my life.
I really wanted to thank you.

402
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,400
I'm glad you're so happy.

403
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,740
By the way... I...

404
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,140
What?

405
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,250
Mas... ter.

406
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,720
What do you want Mimi?

407
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,520
I used up all my memory
during that fight.

408
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,460
I need you to expand
my memory again.

409
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,530
Well... that is...

410
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,670
But if you're gentler this time,
I will be very happy.

411
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,740
Mimi!

412
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,210
I'm about to hang up again.

413
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,220
Type is small for each other

414
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,560
Although we hurt each other

415
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:25,230
My heart still
believes more than ever

416
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,740
In the name of fate
we are destined to be together

417
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,940
Dreaming of that kind of love

418
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,410
Since I feel so sure
of your faith in me

419
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,850
No matter how much the
program takes over my heart

420
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,620
Your hot access

421
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,190
As I feel more love from you

422
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,280
Most likely I will get
you into more trouble

423
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,620
But, please accept my wholeness

424
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,720
With my heart kept innocent,
like I'm bare naked in front of you

425
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,490
As I stand close to you

426
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,230
Your hot access

427
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,330
I am longing for

428
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,980
I finally finished processing the
transfer to my master's school.

429
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,480
I am gonna enjoy campus
life to the fullest!!

430
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,910
Or so I was hoping...

431
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,420
But those annoying Nac
sisters showed up again.

432
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,090
The youngest, Performa,
is quite strong though.

433
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,090
This could be my
biggest crisis ever!

434
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,560
Buttobi CPU, Episode 3,
"Graceful Reset"

435
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,230
I wanna memory up with you tonight.
