1
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:30,540
This?

2
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:39,714
What, again?

3
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,456
Hey.

4
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:59,831
Hey. What's going on?

5
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,818
That was close.

6
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:27,496
Hey. Wait a second.

7
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:31,863
A thank you wouldn't hurt.

8
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,902
l say this for your sake.

9
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,665
Don't get involved in these problems
of the Ancient World.

10
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,070
What?

11
00:02:38,307 --> 00:02:40,502
lf you value your life.

12
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:44,135
What's that?
Are you threatening me?

13
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,704
l never asked you to help me.

14
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:49,408
Anyway, l gave you the advice.

15
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,082
Hey.

16
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:54,451
Wait a second!

17
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,257
Damn!

18
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,461
My name is Hyde.

19
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,158
l travel around the world
with a childhood friend, Sakra....

20
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:10,238
searching for Treasure
of the Ancient World.

21
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:13,670
We're staying in Arville,
a town on the edge of the frontier.

22
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:15,777
And there is this cave.

23
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,210
The cave is inhabited by monsters,
which is upsetting.

24
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:23,148
But, there are many pretty girls in the town.

25
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:26,382
I was hoping I could have
a reasonably good time.

26
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,788
Well, I was hoping, anyway.

27
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:37,291
Your ladyship! That man is cursed.

28
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,967
You must stay away from him.

29
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:50,344
You're okay now.

30
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:53,614
How did l get here?

31
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,146
The Suhyle Family carriage carried you here.

32
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,481
Hyde, this time it was really close.

33
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:04,486
Thank God Miss Priol found you.

34
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:08,288
l see. The Suhyle Family. Priol.

35
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:12,292
Anyway, Manaty, thank you.
You saved my life again.

36
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:15,000
l've told you many times already.

37
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:17,470
Please be careful with suspicious weapons.

38
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,565
Okay, okay.

39
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:22,939
l have to make a big contribution this time.

40
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,143
-Hyde.
-Yeah?

41
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:27,341
l'd gladly accept contributions, but....

42
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,817
there's something else
l could use your help with.

43
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,118
l have to exorcise a curse
placed on a gem stone.

44
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:38,022
But this may be a little too much
for me alone.

45
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:41,689
l can't do any of this magic stuff.

46
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:43,660
That's fine.

47
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,529
lt's just that, once in a long while...

48
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:50,637
the evil things that are sealed
away get resurrected.

49
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,703
Just in case.

50
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:21,734
Evil one, l order you under the name
of God and Spirit.

51
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:24,598
Leave!

52
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:33,171
Evil one! Disappear!

53
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:44,458
Manaty!

54
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:51,932
Manaty!

55
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:55,803
Manaty! Hey, Manaty!

56
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:59,168
Something is weird. lnside me.

57
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,243
No way. You failed?

58
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:05,113
Hey, Manaty!

59
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,581
Hey, hey.

60
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:11,417
Ouch!

61
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:15,713
Manaty, should l call for help?
Get a hold of yourself!

62
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,085
Damn, what should l do?

63
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:29,466
Manaty, are you all right?
You were, like....

64
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,031
The curse is gone. Thanks to you, Hyde.

65
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:37,005
Really? But, Manaty,
you 're acting a little strange.

66
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,740
Hyde, our task is complete.
Let's take a little break.

67
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:44,783
What?

68
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:46,878
With me.

69
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:49,353
Hey, Manaty!

70
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,481
Hey, Manaty!

71
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:53,653
What're you doing?
What's gotten into you?

72
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:57,491
Your thing is twitching. Cute.

73
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:06,341
lt's getting big.

74
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,143
My lovely Manaty.

75
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:09,835
Your tongue is so warm.

76
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,142
But why?

77
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:22,085
l'm so glad. l sucked it,
and now it's this big.

78
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:49,680
No, Manaty. lf you do that....

79
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:52,813
lt's all right, come.

80
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,717
Come a lot, in my mouth.

81
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,050
No, Manaty, really.

82
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:10,998
Your semen is so thick and delicious.

83
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:20,879
But l can't be satisfied only
with sucking alone.

84
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:23,083
Not with just my mouth.

85
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:27,949
Now l want you to lick mine.

86
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:33,292
Hyde, there. lt feels so good!

87
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,589
Wow, Manaty,
you're already drenched here.

88
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:42,529
l've been like this for a while.

89
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:45,133
Manaty, you're a bad priest.

90
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:48,572
Would your God forgive
a horny priest like yourself?

91
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:52,612
l don't know.

92
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:00,616
No, don't lick inside!

93
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:04,554
No, not there, no!

94
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,331
No, l can't anymore, no.

95
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:12,023
No more.

96
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:17,338
l can't wait anymore. l'm going crazy.

97
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,542
Okay. Then lie down over there.

98
00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:24,943
Okay, relax. l'm coming in.

99
00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:27,946
lt hurts!

100
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:29,448
What?

101
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,551
Manaty, this can't be your first.

102
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,726
Hey, hey.

103
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,191
No.

104
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:42,855
Don't stop. Give me more.

105
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:45,900
Push inside me. With your cock.

106
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:47,898
But, Manaty....

107
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:56,176
Manaty.

108
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:58,509
Okay, Manaty.

109
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:03,311
A priest preaches about love.
A priest has to know about love.

110
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:07,554
Don't worry.

111
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,056
l'll teach you all about love.

112
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,120
Look, relax.

113
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,423
No, no!

114
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:22,263
ls this too painful?

115
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:26,232
No, don't stop. lt feels good. Good!

116
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,733
Manaty.

117
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,675
l'm going crazy.

118
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,972
l see. Manaty is a horny priest after all.

119
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:37,611
She looks like she's enjoying it so much.

120
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,420
Okay, l'll make it better for you.

121
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:45,050
No, no, if you do it like that.

122
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:48,562
Come on, Manaty, you can come
anytime you want to.

123
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,468
No!

124
00:10:58,307 --> 00:10:59,968
l'm so hot.

125
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:14,052
Oops!

126
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:23,195
You!

127
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,724
Ouch!

128
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:26,899
No, Sakra, why?

129
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:30,664
That girl you brought to Dr. Shizki,
who is she?

130
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:33,534
Who? l've never even heard of her.

131
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:37,304
Listen, Sakra, l meant to tell you.

132
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:40,607
You suddenly brought a naked girl
to the doctor and said....

133
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:44,379
''Please examine her!''
What's wrong with you?

134
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:50,821
l didn't know what to do,
so l figured l'd better bring her here.

135
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:56,295
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

136
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:02,402
She's coming to.

137
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:05,700
You have no need to be afraid.

138
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:08,005
l am Shizki. l am a doctor in this town.

139
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,835
A doctor?

140
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:12,613
Yes. What is thy name?

141
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,314
Eura.

142
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:19,281
Now, Eura, what was thy doing in the cave?

143
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,479
The cave?

144
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,155
Yes.

145
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:25,993
What happened in the cave?

146
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:27,585
What cave?

147
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:31,027
Thou was in the cave, or not?

148
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:34,569
l don't know. l just don't....

149
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:38,604
Could it be you don't remember?

150
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:40,302
No.

151
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:42,343
Wait a moment.

152
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:45,474
You don't remember me, rescuing you?

153
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,384
Then, you....

154
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:53,747
However you slice it, it doesn't make sense.

155
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:56,723
A girl, alone, passed out in a cave?

156
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:00,657
And she was naked?

157
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:05,325
l'm telling you the truth!

158
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:07,501
Enough is enough!

159
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:13,240
This is getting us nowhere.

160
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:19,845
l'm not lying. l'm telling you the truth.

161
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:32,127
l'm so unlucky today. No treasure.

162
00:13:32,494 --> 00:13:34,359
All the monsters.

163
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:58,282
Hey, Dr. Shizki.

164
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:01,082
You're out late, Hyde.

165
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,818
What's up?

166
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:07,491
Well, l wanted a word or two with thee.

167
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,664
l'd be delighted!

168
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:12,191
Sorry to bother thou this late.

169
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:15,700
Make yourself at home.
l have nothing to offer you, though.

170
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,569
Don't bother. This is good enough.

171
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,372
ls Sakra out?

172
00:14:22,911 --> 00:14:25,038
She's in the next room.

173
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:27,881
Aren't thou staying in the same room?

174
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,611
Why would you think that?

175
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:33,482
Why? Thou are either married or lovers.

176
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:35,149
lt doesn't make sense.

177
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,485
What makes you say that?

178
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,150
Thou two are not, then? l figured....

179
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:44,857
Hey, you didn't come all the way here
at this hour to talk about that.

180
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,230
That is true.

181
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,197
l wanted to talk to thee about Eura.

182
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:53,173
What about Eura?

183
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:57,743
Who the hell is she?

184
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,316
What do you mean?

185
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:03,878
l, too, thought it was strange.

186
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:08,255
Thou said she was all alone in that cave.

187
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:12,349
Thou know about the rumor everybody's
talking about in the town?

188
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:17,055
They say that cave is the largest
ancient world ruin ever discovered.

189
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,733
lt sounds like an old wife's tale, yet...

190
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:24,034
here comes a girl with no memory,
discovered in the same cave.

191
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:26,297
What are you saying?

192
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:30,134
Thou are hiding something, aren't thou?

193
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:34,343
Okay, l'll tell you.

194
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,974
But l don't know that much, either.

195
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:38,514
Tell me.

196
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:42,484
Two weeks ago,
l entered that cave for the first time.

197
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:45,485
There, l ran into a man.

198
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:48,923
He was dying when l got there.

199
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,756
When l held him in my arms....

200
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:57,303
He pushes this into my hand.

201
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,907
Then that was the end of him.

202
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,179
Then, about a week later....

203
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:13,978
Not here. Not yet.

204
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:16,090
Let's move ahead.

205
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:31,735
What is this? lt's shining.

206
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:04,400
What the hell?

207
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:06,765
No way. She can't be alive.
A doll, maybe?

208
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:16,066
Not here.

209
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:17,943
Not here.

210
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,878
Not here, not here, not here.

211
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:22,610
Nothing's here.

212
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:25,148
There's no treasure here.

213
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:28,620
The quick way would be to ask her.

214
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,585
Not again.

215
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,523
What is it this time?

216
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:45,469
So that's what happened, in a nutshell.

217
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,440
Then Eura is....

218
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:49,936
l'm not quire sure yet.

219
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:54,238
But l'm sure she has something
to do with the Ancient World.

220
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,414
l see. And what is thy intention?

221
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:00,350
What?

222
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:02,557
Could thee be after the treasure?

223
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,820
Hyde?

224
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,060
l'd be lying if l said
that l didn't have that angle.

225
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,391
Hyde, thou not--

226
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,191
But?

227
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:13,795
You've seen Eura, haven't you?

228
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:16,696
She's just an ordinary girl,
however you look at her.

229
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:21,531
l'm not conceited enough
to think l could somehow help her.

230
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:24,573
But l would love to be of some help to her.

231
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:26,814
That's what l want.

232
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:31,182
Of course, l haven't given up
on the treasure.

233
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:35,623
l see. Then l had nothing
to worry about, after all.

234
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:36,551
What?

235
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:40,684
l don't care who that girl is.

236
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:43,960
Makes no difference to me,
what l have to do.

237
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:46,660
l just want to make a difference
for the injured and the sick.

238
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:50,933
But l wanted to find out
what thy intentions were.

239
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:55,970
Just in case thy sole motivation
was to somehow exploit Eura.

240
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,811
l am relieved.

241
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:03,811
Now l know thou cares about that girl,
like any normal person would.

242
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:10,223
lt is getting late. l shall leave.

243
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,789
What? Leaving already?

244
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:14,954
Of course. My business is taken care of.

245
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,191
What's wrong?
Why don't you spend the night?

246
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:19,426
You came all the way over!

247
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:22,698
Thou art speaking ridiculous!
Why should l?

248
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,499
Why did you get up?

249
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,238
Dr. Shizki.

250
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:31,675
What?

251
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,010
You came to visit a man's room,
late at night.

252
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,585
You were ready to face the consequences,
weren't you?

253
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:41,149
What the hell art thou thinking?

254
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,847
Sakra is asleep next door,
for heaven's sake!

255
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,523
Don't worry about her.

256
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,558
Once she falls asleep,
nothing can wake her up.

257
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:51,854
That is not the issue!
l just came over to talk.

258
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,536
Thou would approach any woman.
ls that it?

259
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:01,875
Thou hast no real sense of fidelity!

260
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:06,911
That's not true.
l do this only for you, Dr. Shizki.

261
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,907
l won't be tricked like that.

262
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,769
Dr. Shizki, you're not resisting any more.

263
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:42,114
Even if l resisted, there's no way l could
physically overpower thee.

264
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:46,346
So you say, but this is
what you want, isn't it?

265
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:48,548
Don't be ridiculous--

266
00:22:05,874 --> 00:22:08,638
No, don't.

267
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:14,604
See how much your body is begging for it?

268
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:18,812
That is just a physiological reaction.

269
00:22:21,022 --> 00:22:23,252
This too, down here?

270
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:29,425
ls this one of those
physiological reactions?

271
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,199
What about....

272
00:22:34,502 --> 00:22:36,766
This is just hard, isn't it?

273
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:38,362
We have to relieve this
physiological reaction.

274
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:40,837
Not like....

275
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:43,272
Do you like it that much?

276
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:47,910
No, no, l didn't mean....

277
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:52,119
No, no....

278
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,812
lt's not good for you to fight, Doctor.

279
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:01,187
No!

280
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:03,388
No, not like that.

281
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:06,056
Not there.

282
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:12,471
Good.

283
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:21,708
You're pumping nectar down here,
begging me to lick more and more.

284
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,351
No, that's a lie.

285
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:25,113
That's not a lie.

286
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:28,984
No. l'm so embarrassed.

287
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,624
Not there, not there.

288
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,761
You're very sensitive here.

289
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:40,766
Yes, l am. So, please don't be so mean.

290
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:53,136
No.

291
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,782
Time to come inside the doctor.

292
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,782
No, wait.

293
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:21,935
No.

294
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:23,874
lt feels good.

295
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,913
Finally, you're being honest.

296
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:30,216
But it's been such a long time.

297
00:24:30,518 --> 00:24:32,543
l see.

298
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,554
How does a cock feel,
after such a long time?

299
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:38,851
l can't say. l'm embarrassed.

300
00:24:39,961 --> 00:24:41,588
No, don't.

301
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:46,825
No, no, Dr. Shizki.
You have to be more honest with yourself.

302
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:51,602
lt's so good. l want you to do more.

303
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,464
Well said.

304
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:58,712
Now that you've said that, Dr. Shizki,
l have to satisfy you.

305
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:08,482
No.

306
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,655
Come all the way inside me!

307
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,597
lt feels so good!

308
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:22,268
No, it feels too good, no!

309
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:26,765
Dr. Shizki, no, if you do it like that, l can't....

310
00:25:30,145 --> 00:25:32,545
Hyde, l can't any more.
