1
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,650
Let's go! Hurry!

2
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,560
Now, l get to take your clothes off at last.

3
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,100
Pearl: ''No! After this, please no more!''
Makoto: ''Hehehe! Don't move around so much!''

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,600
Pearl: ''l love you! l'm never letting you go!''
Makoto: ''Wait a minute!''

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,540
No! l was all set to see a naked woman!

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,330
Why did l waste so much time on this, damn it?!

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,140
What's wrong with Kenta?

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,040
Saiki, don't stop...

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,820
My peak sexual years are being wasted at this rate.

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,690
Goddess of Happiness, please rescue me from my celibacy!

11
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,270
Can Can Bunny

12
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,300
Can Can Bunny
Extra 1

13
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,110
Long time no see, Kenta.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,780
Who are you?

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,750
What? You've forgotten?

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,820
l am Suwatee the Benzaiten Goddess.

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,280
Suwatee?

18
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,690
Still living in the same tiny apartment?

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,190
Always playing dirty games on the computer and never studying.

20
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,490
Am l dreaming?

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,600
See for yourself.

22
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,070
l didn't feel anything!

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,310
We can only be seen by the pure of heart.

24
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,150
And those with very strong faith.

25
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,550
So, which am l?

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,190
You finally reached enlightenment.

27
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,350
Yes, the moment you realized you were an idiot.

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,660
l'd like to wake up now!

29
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,460
Who the hell's he talking to?

30
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,370
Keep your mind on me.

31
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,040
Who cares what he's doing?

32
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,480
But he's my friend.

33
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,380
Then, drop in on him later.

34
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,050
Yes, Wakaba.

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,380
You want to move in with me?

36
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,110
Commuting from the other world is a pain!

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,620
Please, Kenta.

38
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,860
But, hold on...

39
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,790
For your trouble, Suwatee will grant you a wish.

40
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,350
Grant me a wish?

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,190
Anything?

42
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,690
Sure...

43
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,230
l see...

44
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,080
What is it?

45
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,350
Something l've wanted for a long time.

46
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,820
You want me to help you get laid by beautiful women?!

47
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,520
Not so loud!

48
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,290
Don't laugh! lt's not like l'm a complete loser.

49
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,600
lt's just hard for me to meet girls.

50
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,700
Well, if that's what you want...

51
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,510
Alright. l will grant you your wish.

52
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,500
You will?

53
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,900
Your wish...

54
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,970
...Suwatee grants!

55
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,940
W-What the hell?

56
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,530
Suwatee! How could you?!

57
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,510
What if Emperor Shibi finds out?

58
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,270
Wow, what the hell happened?

59
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,890
l caused fragments of the Seven Great Northern Stars to fall to Earth.

60
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,050
Kenta, you will have the chance to meet seven beautiful women.

61
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,920
Really?

62
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,400
But, you must sleep with each of them,

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,800
or they will forget you ever existed.

64
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,170
l don't see that as a problem!

65
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,700
Now the world will see what a lady's man l can be!

66
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,170
<i>Poor Kenta, lack of sex has driven him crazy.</i>

67
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,110
Oh well, back to screwing Wakaba.

68
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,740
So, can we stay with you, Kenta?

69
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,680
Please, it would be my pleasure.

70
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,820
l don't know what Suwatee sees in this guy.

71
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,760
lt's a hard one to figure out.

72
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,860
<i>Seven women.</i>

73
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,830
<i>l wonder what they'll be like?</i>

74
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,900
<i>Maybe someone like her.</i>

75
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,770
<i>Or a traditional girl like her.</i>

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,940
<i>A school girl would be nice too. l can't wait!</i>

77
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,020
<i>Kenta, can you handle this?</i>

78
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,320
Your taste in men is terrible!

79
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,820
Shuree!

80
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,090
Hi! What have you been up to, Suwatee?

81
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,730
Why did you summon the fragments of the Seven Stars?

82
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,490
l wanted to make Kenta happy.

83
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,900
Jeez! What if that pervert, Shibi, finds out?

84
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,940
Why didn't you ask your dear cousin for advice?

85
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,280
What good is it if the one you love can't touch you?

86
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,280
<i>Actually, if l have my way, he will touch me.</i>

87
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,620
The power of this fragment will allow me to take on human form.

88
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,630
Once he sees me as a woman, Kenta will love me as one.

89
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,000
You're getting ahead of yourself, aren't you?

90
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,930
Okay, but l must see what kind of man this loverboy is.

91
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,550
Sorry! Pardon me!

92
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,880
Please, let me go.

93
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,090
What's wrong with having fun, little girl?

94
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,750
You like to have fun, don't you?

95
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,790
Come with us, and we'll show you a real good time.

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,730
But...

97
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,200
l'm sorry, can you excuse me for a second.

98
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,970
Sorry l'm late. We better get going.

99
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,770
Hold it!

100
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,140
Oh, uh, we're late for our date.

101
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,210
Don't even try to lie to me, you pathetic loser!

102
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,550
l see... nothing else l can do then...

103
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,250
Run!

104
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,590
Kenta!

105
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,380
Jeez, l can't bring myself to watch.

106
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,590
Are you okay?

107
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,560
l'm fine.

108
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,430
l hate it when a little puke screws with my evening plans.

109
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,000
Kick his ass, Abe!

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,060
That's a good idea.

111
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,170
Now, hold on just a second!

112
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,830
Get outta my face!

113
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,040
Hoshiro!

114
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,720
Y-You...

115
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,120
l did it again...

116
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,360
That's it?

117
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,460
Man, he's a lost cause.

118
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, l get it, Kaori! You're trained in martial arts.

119
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,530
Still, you were the only one who tried to help me. Thank you.

120
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,700
Well...

121
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,910
What a moron.

122
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,600
Why you...

123
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,540
Use my name. lt's Misao Aoyama.

124
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,010
Okay, so why was Misao being so mean to little Kaori?

125
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,950
Abe thought Kaori was shy, so we were taking her to a disco. That's all.

126
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,680
That's it?

127
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,760
You think that was reason enough for you to treat her so badly?

128
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,330
lt's all right, Kenta.

129
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,600
Misao, isn't your mother Yoko Goto, the famous rock star?

130
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,070
Oh, it must be nice being the kid of a big celebrity like that.

131
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,480
lt's not like l had a choice in the matter!

132
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,610
l don't know why we bothered with her.

133
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,720
Who'd want to dance with an old hag, anyway?

134
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,750
So you think l'm an old hag?

135
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,020
What do you think, Kenta?

136
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,490
l-l would never say that!

137
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,830
Are you saying l don't have rhythm?

138
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,360
All right, let's go!

139
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,940
l'll meet your challenge on the disco floor.

140
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,830
Oh boy, here we go.

141
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,060
You've got really good moves!

142
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,050
You have some too.

143
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,790
Kaori is really hot, but Misao turns me on too.

144
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,600
Why choose when l can have both?

145
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,230
What do you mean ''both'', you dork?

146
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,470
Who are you?

147
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,340
l am Rakusho, the Kishouten Goddess. Suwatee is my cousin.

148
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,480
Everyone calls me Shuree.

149
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,400
Suwatee's cousin?

150
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,770
W-What?

151
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,650
From what l've seen, you are definitely a low-life.

152
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,980
Why you!

153
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,920
Shouldn't you be eyeing your prospects?

154
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,800
<i>And now the main event!</i>

155
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,160
<i>Who will be tonight's Dancing Queen?</i>

156
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,170
<i>The next number is ''Don't Walk'' by Yoko Goto,</i>

157
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,070
<i>the best hit of this week!</i>

158
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,560
<i>Let's dance together, Disco Goddesses!</i>

159
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,570
This is your mother's song.

160
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,440
l'm worried.

161
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,460
Kaori rules! She's the best!

162
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,830
Looking good, Misao! You can do it!

163
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,750
They both dance great.

164
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,810
Who are you rooting for?

165
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,120
You dance well.

166
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,020
l guess dancing to your mother's music makes it easier.

167
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,360
Festival dancing suits you better!

168
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,990
l don't like the looks of this.

169
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,030
l sense a fight brewing.

170
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,830
You have no idea how awful it is to have a famous mom!

171
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,270
You spoiled brat! You just want to suck your mom's milk until you die!

172
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,570
Oh boy, here we go.

173
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,160
Don't take that, Misao! Show the magic kick!

174
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,390
Let her have it. Try the hurricane punch!

175
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,270
Man, this is getting serious. Hey, Shuree...

176
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,100
You want me to break it up?

177
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,170
Would you, please?

178
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,540
Alright...

179
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,290
ln the name of the Kishoten, rulers of Light and Darkness, l command thee!

180
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,690
Spirits of the air, wake the spirit of light that sleeps in the dark depths!

181
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,950
Unleash your energy!

182
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,600
W-What the hell?

183
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,180
Jeez, l shouldn't have involved Shuree.

184
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,280
Misao, why don't you take the bed?

185
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,420
She said she prefers the couch.

186
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,320
Oh...

187
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,590
l acted like a child tonight.

188
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,390
Still, you're a very sweet girl.

189
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,830
You could have beaten her up.

190
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,540
Misao has a hard time sharing her mother with the world.

191
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,540
That's why she hangs out with those thugs to relieve her loneliness.

192
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,080
Well, time for bed.

193
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,890
l'd better head home.

194
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,910
Don't go.

195
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,880
That is...

196
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,860
l guess she's attracted to blockheads.

197
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,300
He is not! He's very kind!

198
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,860
Sure, sure... l guess you see something l don't.

199
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,300
Please, turn the lights off.

200
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,840
No, l want to see your beautiful body.

201
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,750
But, l'm shy.

202
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,280
Quietly...

203
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,220
l can't help it...

204
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,620
Misao will hear me...

205
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,270
No... not there!

206
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,340
l can't...

207
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,610
<i>Someone help me.</i>

208
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,120
No, give me more!

209
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,950
l'm losing it!

210
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,160
So good!

211
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,730
l'm so wet!

212
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,430
Harder! Even harder!

213
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,910
<i>Please stop, l can't control myself...</i>

214
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,090
No... that's embarrassing...

215
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,120
No, now we're doing it doggie style!

216
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,730
My back, my back... please...

217
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,410
l'm dying! l'm dying!

218
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,840
Harder! More please! More!

219
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,550
<i>No, no, l can't...</i>

220
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,720
<i>lt feels so good! Please help me!</i>

221
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,730
This feels so good!

222
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,630
So good...

223
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,860
Kaori!

224
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,170
l can't hold back, l'm cumming!

225
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,730
l'm cumming! l'm cumming!

226
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,740
Together! Together!

227
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,000
Hey, wake up!

228
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,170
Come on...

229
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,470
You can't sleep...

230
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,470
Huh?

231
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,420
Kenta?

232
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,880
Who did you think l was?

233
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,850
That's right, you stayed the night.

234
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,320
Get up, sleepyhead.

235
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,810
Okay, let's go.

236
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,460
Huh? Where?

237
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,750
Here, take a look.

238
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,820
Wow! Tickets to the dinosaur exhibit!

239
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,260
Did you get these for me?

240
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,030
Kaori suggested it.

241
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,130
Kaori? Where is she?

242
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,660
She took off already.

243
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,530
She works as a tour guide at the exhibit.

244
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,270
<i>Trying to get into this one's pants too?</i>

245
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,610
Shuree...

246
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,680
Shut up! l'm trying to patch up their friendship!

247
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,380
<i>So you can have a threesome?</i>

248
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,750
N-No!

249
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,910
Kenta, why are you talking to thin air?

250
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,090
No! Um! lt's so early l must still be dreaming!

251
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,090
Goodness, he's such a prude.

252
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,460
l figured he'd be banging her already.

253
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,790
Kenta isn't that kind of guy!

254
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,300
Sure, sure, whatever you say, Princess.

255
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,040
Those guys again?

256
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,390
You came at a good time.

257
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,220
The exhibit isn't crowded on weekdays.

258
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,630
Oh wow, l can't believe they're real!

259
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,860
l'm glad you're having a good time.

260
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,940
Hey, can l touch one of them?

261
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,270
No, it's not allowed.

262
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,830
You're so stingy.

263
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:48,910
What's the matter?

264
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,840
Kaori, l gotta go...

265
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,510
Down that hall.

266
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,880
Excuse me for a second.

267
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,280
He's such a funny guy.

268
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,550
Now, let's see what that tough girl is doing.

269
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,860
The same jerks as before?

270
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,220
Can you keep your knees from shaking?

271
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,000
Hey, l can do it!

272
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,730
Oh? Who fell on their ass last time?

273
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,040
Shuree!

274
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,570
Kenta!
Shuree!

275
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,200
Kenta!

276
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,200
How cold. You didn't even call or anything.

277
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,710
What do you care?

278
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,640
Hey, we're just worried about you.

279
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,480
You can stop worrying!

280
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,410
Stay out of my life!

281
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,920
You're the one who wanted to hang out with us.

282
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,220
Now then, show her.

283
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,960
A rape video starring Yoko Goto's daughter should make us a fortune.

284
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,600
l-l won't let you!

285
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,800
Any luck, Kenta?

286
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,230
She wasn't there.

287
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,470
l don't like the way this looks.

288
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,870
l'm scared.

289
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,210
Let's split up and search.

290
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:55,680
Alright.

291
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,680
l didn't know you were a virgin.

292
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,260
That'll make the tape even more valuable!

293
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,350
She's all lubed up. Let's get some real action going!

294
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,800
Who are you?

295
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,540
What the hell are you doing to her?!

296
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,370
Oh, it's the pussy from yesterday.

297
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,500
Eat this!

298
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,310
Come on, how can you save Misao when you're lying down?

299
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,980
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

300
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,190
He's getting his ass kicked again.

301
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,950
Kenta!

302
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,450
Your wish...

303
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,650
...Suwatee grants!

304
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,200
Creatures in extinction, sleeping in eternity!

305
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,080
ln the name of the Kishoten, rulers of time and space, l command thee!

306
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,670
Walk through time and resurrect!

307
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,010
Save us!

308
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,380
Mommy!

309
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,650
What's their problem?

310
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,610
Wait! Where's Misao?

311
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,960
l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

312
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,790
Calm down.

313
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,030
But, l...

314
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,270
Please do to me what you did to Kaori last night.

315
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,200
You were awake? l'm sorry.

316
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,670
Don't be.

317
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,110
l was so jealous of Kaori.

318
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,670
Kenta, please.

319
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,320
Are you sure?

320
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,310
Please, be gentle with me.

321
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,280
That's right, this is your first time.

322
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,580
l want it to be with you.

323
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,010
Wait...

324
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,100
Your fingers, the feeling's so strong!

325
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,340
You're more sensitive when it's your first time.

326
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,850
l can't help it. l can't help it.

327
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,950
Oh, so he ends up bagging her too.

328
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,550
So, why don't you join them?

329
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,890
l'm only kidding!

330
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,390
Oh no, not that!
