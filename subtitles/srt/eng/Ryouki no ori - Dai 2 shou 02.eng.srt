1
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:23,689
Well, isn't this wonderful?
Cursed Amusement Park.

2
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,431
Thanks to this incident,
the number of visitors...

3
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:30,333
has dropped radically.

4
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:32,335
On top of that,
the medias been snooping around...

5
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,271
ruining the corporations image.

6
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:36,241
POISONED!

7
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:38,072
Fantasien Suspected of Excess Debt

8
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:43,281
With the stocks falling,
we'll have to reconsider our plans.

9
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:50,114
The corporations administrative strategy
will be extensively restructured.

10
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:54,025
Morimoto.

11
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:55,059
Our loss is immense.

12
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:58,196
You wouldn't be able to pay for it
even if you...

13
00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:01,200
worked your entire life.

14
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:06,032
To begin with,
despite being in charge of the park...

15
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:11,539
your risk management, or lack thereof,
is the entire cause of this mess!

16
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:15,378
Do you understand?

17
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,709
And how do you plan
to take responsibility?

18
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:19,683
Well I--

19
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:22,219
Well, at any rate, since I'm here...

20
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:25,256
the executive committee
is taking a wait-and-see attitude.

21
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:30,920
But if anything else major were to happen,
a decision must be made.

22
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:34,562
I'm afraid we'll have to say good-bye to you.

23
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:42,231
Just relax! Theres nothing for you
to worry about now that I'm here.

24
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:45,400
Cheer up.

25
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:59,353
The Bizarre Cage

26
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:04,591
The 2nd Chapter

27
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:11,227
Act 2 Thou Shalt Not Covet

28
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:51,976
The bride holds the secret bouquet.

29
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,344
Kajiwara! Kajiwara!

30
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,217
Gotcha!

31
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:42,918
You look down! That's not like you at all!

32
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:54,572
It wasn't your fault.

33
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,373
But I wasn't able to do anything.

34
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,852
Takeshi, it's okay.

35
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:14,852
What the hell are you doing
at a time like this?

36
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,162
That's it! That's the Takeshi I know!

37
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,038
Now this is my Takeshi!

38
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,206
Thanks for worrying about me, Tamami.

39
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:30,938
There, there.

40
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:34,612
I'll let you off with a classy dinner!

41
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:37,379
Yeah, right.

42
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:56,429
No way!

43
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:10,446
Why were you pretending to be a guy?

44
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:14,283
Looks like you have a reason.

45
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:22,055
Three months ago.
A girl died at this park.

46
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:26,489
Yeah, that suicide case.

47
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:28,627
That was my little sister.

48
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:31,795
That wasn't a suicide.

49
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:37,402
She, Ruriko was pushed off
from Draculas Castle!

50
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,973
Her body showed signs of rape.

51
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:47,446
Not only was Ruriko raped,
she was murdered by someone.

52
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:51,323
The police took a pessimistic view
of the evidence and declared...

53
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:54,493
that she took her own life afterwards.

54
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:59,325
They still haven't found any evidence
on the culprit so he still.

55
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:03,532
So, I'm going to find him myself!

56
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:07,796
You're Hiromi Morimoto, right?

57
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:13,544
You are under arrest under suspicion
of the murder of Makoto Kajiwara.

58
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:16,580
What do you mean?

59
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:21,178
This container was tested
for the poison used in the murder...

60
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:24,119
and came back positive.

61
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:26,657
And?

62
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:30,762
Hiromi Morimoto, your fingerprints
were also found on this.

63
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:33,933
Wait, there's got to be some mistake!

64
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:37,034
Stop it! Just hear me out!

65
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:38,463
I don't know anything!

66
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,839
Let go of me, damn it!

67
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:44,405
Hey, wait! Why so sudden!
Let her speak!

68
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:45,910
Saito, no!

69
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:50,648
Saito! Let go of me!
This is some mistake!

70
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:52,010
I don't know anything! Believe me!

71
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:53,480
Don't, Saito!

72
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:54,485
I've nothing to with it!

73
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:55,646
Morimoto!

74
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:59,123
Hey! Let go, god damn it! Saito!

75
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:01,217
If you attempt to interfere,
I will have you arrested...

76
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,319
for obstruction of justice.

77
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:06,655
Morimoto.

78
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:12,864
Takeshi! Bad news!

79
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:24,576
Who is it?

80
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:29,911
Saito?

81
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:31,913
What's wrong?

82
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:38,423
I'm sorry.
If I had done a better job, maybe....

83
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:41,359
You don't have to blame yourself.

84
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:45,862
I'm leaving because it is part of my job.

85
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:50,970
It's a supervisor's job
to take responsibility for things.

86
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:56,338
I liked this room.

87
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,591
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:10,987
Miss Amano?

89
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,327
Saito.

90
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,371
I can't see Morimoto as the culprit.
There's someone else.

91
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,538
This case isn't over!

92
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:19,680
I see.

93
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,512
The reason I asked the main branch
for help was because...

94
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:28,349
I was suspicious of MAOS bugs.

95
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,864
MAOS does not have
a central control system...

96
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:33,965
a main computer.

97
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:39,163
Each block contains its own computer,
which is connected to a network...

98
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:42,604
and utilizes their shared
correction program to process...

99
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:46,008
the data and manages
each other as a whole system.

100
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:49,140
But lately an unknown error
has been occurring...

101
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:51,578
frequently in the management system...

102
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:54,544
and the entire system
became very unstable.

103
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:58,821
But, all the computers are managing
each other...

104
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,925
and I just can't imagine that all the
computers went haywire all at once.

105
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:04,192
A virus!

106
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:07,766
No, that's not possible with this system.

107
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:12,066
Plus, even if someone were to attempt
to hack this system...

108
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:15,135
they wouldn't be able
to understand this code.

109
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:20,075
Then what would happen
if MAOS were to crash?

110
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:25,243
No way! It's inconceivable
for MAOS to crash.

111
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:30,681
But if it were to happen
while the park is closed...

112
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:36,560
the people inside would be
trapped in a dangerous environment.

113
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:40,157
As if they were trapped inside a cage.

114
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,227
Fantasien being a cage?

115
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:48,964
Does it have anything to do
with this unknown number?

116
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:53,809
I don't know. But it did start happening
around the same time.

117
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,241
What could it mean?

118
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:57,142
A warning from MAOS.

119
00:13:57,383 --> 00:14:00,181
No, it may be an S.O.S.

120
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:01,242
S.O.S.?

121
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,245
Besides that, look at this.

122
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:08,989
The one of the cage
returns before the bride.

123
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,894
The time of vengeance has come, S.K.

124
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:13,394
What's this?

125
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:17,259
It came two or three days
before Kajiwara died.

126
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:19,664
But it seems that it was
accidentally sent to me...

127
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:21,934
instead of the intended receiver.

128
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,638
What could it mean?

129
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:26,267
I dont know.

130
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:31,643
But I have a feeling that these two incidents
have some relationship to each other.

131
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:35,312
Who could this S.K. be?

132
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:40,357
You have an idea, dont you?

133
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,126
Who is it?

134
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:47,288
Professor Soichiro, Kusakabe.

135
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:56,100
Good Morning!

136
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:00,442
How are you all doing today?

137
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:04,815
We're going to work our asses off
and make some money!

138
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:09,048
Due to the recent incident
we've been losing customers...

139
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,214
but with you guys' help,
we'll find a way to pull out of--

140
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:12,790
No way.

141
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,983
That's impossible!

142
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,590
Soichiro isn't the type of person
to do such a thing!

143
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,493
I'm sorry.

144
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:24,927
I'm sorry to have disturbed you all!

145
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:29,197
What are you guys doing
at a time like this!

146
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:33,168
Where was I? Yes.

147
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,941
Soichiro was my upperclassman in college,
and he was...

148
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:39,218
in the same club as Masakazu and Okyo.

149
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,749
He was nice and compassionate.

150
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:45,722
He's not the person to do such a thing.

151
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:49,789
Professor Kusakabe is the person
who programmed MAOS, right?

152
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:51,220
Yes, that's right.

153
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:54,398
He was so smart,
they even called him a genius...

154
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:57,368
in the Artificial Intelligence
Development Club.

155
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:01,369
Part of his fundamental research
is the MAOS system.

156
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,732
But he disappeared without a trace...

157
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,538
right after Fantasien was completed,
didn't he?

158
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:08,045
But no one else seems likely to be able to
hack into the system.

159
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:12,311
Did they use something?

160
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:19,988
Maybe.

161
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,220
If they used Carmila, then maybe.

162
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,763
What is this Carmila?

163
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:31,495
Well, Carmila is a system
that Soichiro developed...

164
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,097
as an upgraded version of MAOS.

165
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:37,876
I have a copy of it myself
and use it to gather data.

166
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:42,241
But it's still incomplete,
so its capabilities are pretty limited.

167
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:46,013
But if they used this, then maybe.

168
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:48,885
So, is there a complete version of Carmila?

169
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:56,653
No. It was almost complete,
but before it was finished Soichiro.

170
00:16:57,363 --> 00:17:00,332
Disappeared.

171
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:04,864
I just don't get it.

172
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:07,937
During the entire incident with Kajiwara,
all of Fantasiens...

173
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:10,874
security system
was functioning properly...

174
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:14,240
yet there isn't any recording
that contains a single clue.

175
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:19,482
So did the bad guy fiddle
with the system, then?

176
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:22,547
MAOS condition is still unreliable.

177
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:25,322
Something can happen again.

178
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,958
So that means someone
else is being targeted?

179
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:33,955
But who? And for what reason?

180
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:39,999
Anyways, we have to find the culprit fast!

181
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:42,706
For Morimoto, and Miss Amanos sake.

182
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:47,508
Youre right!
Takeshi, I'm going to help out, too.

183
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:50,978
Then I'm going to check MAOS
again for anything.

184
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:24,213
That is all I know.

185
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:27,349
I see.

186
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:30,784
All right. Dont feel so down, Kitazawa.

187
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:36,189
Takeshi and I are here for you.
If there's anything, feel free to ask us.

188
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:39,493
Thank you very much, you two.

189
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:43,691
Now if you'll excuse me,
I still have work to do.

190
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:54,913
Her boyfriend was just killed
and she has work?

191
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:59,439
But that may help divert her sorrow,
couldn't it?

192
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:02,281
Yeah.

193
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:09,823
I'm going to check over there.

194
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:10,862
Then I'm this way!

195
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,056
I'm counting on you.

196
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:12,563
Yes!

197
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:32,781
Hey, Kazuko. This part, isn't right.

198
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:40,757
Saito!

199
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:44,251
It's you, Sasazuka!

200
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:52,736
What's wrong,
bringing me all the way here?

201
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:01,339
So what? Something personal?

202
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:07,483
No. It's about Masakazu.

203
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,747
That's a coincidence.
I was just looking for Inoue...

204
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,949
so I can get in a few questions.

205
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:16,417
Lately, have you noticed anything
strange about him?

206
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:20,956
Well, it's nothing big, but....

207
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:27,128
<i>Saito! Come here, hurry!</i>

208
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:30,675
<i>There's a big problem with MAOS!</i>
<i>Anyways, just come here!</i>

209
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:31,967
I got it.

210
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:35,907
Sorry, Sasazuka. Well finish this later!

211
00:20:36,282 --> 00:20:37,647
Hey!

212
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:48,022
So, what happened?

213
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:51,590
I contacted Tamami,
so she should be here any minute now.

214
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:54,098
Enough of that, MAOS is going crazy!

215
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,699
Shortcut? If you cannot read the
last character, replace with a !

216
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:07,271
That number is in direct proportion
with MAOS instability...

217
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:11,612
and it seems that it becomes less stable
as the amount of zeros increase.

218
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:14,682
Several programs have
already gone haywire...

219
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,584
and the limiter has already
stopped functioning.

220
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:22,623
On top of that, it rejects our commands,
even if we input it in manually.

221
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:26,159
Then, if all the numbers were
to become zeros?

222
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:27,589
Game over.

223
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:31,692
All of Fantasien
would become uncontrollable.

224
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:35,764
A cage.

225
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:40,768
Shimamoto, any clues on the culprit?

226
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,239
Right now, there isn't any sign
of being hacked by someone outside.

227
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:46,514
But....

228
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:50,048
Is another crime being committed
as we speak?

229
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:56,656
Anyway, our first priority is to shut down
Fantasiens operation ASAP...

230
00:21:56,729 --> 00:22:00,290
and have Egashira schedule
a complete inspection of MAOS!

231
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:17,780
<i>We've got a problem!</i>
<i>The emergency stop mechanism...</i>

232
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,350
<i>won't function due to unstable power.</i>

233
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:22,353
At this rate, the coasters going to fly
off the tracks!

234
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:27,188
Wait a moment! Kazuko!

235
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:32,757
Calm down, Yukari.
I'm going to connect it to a bypass, so wait!

236
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,231
Okay!

237
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:39,060
<i>This is Pharaoh Land!</i>

238
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:41,764
<i>The door to the Mask Room won't open,</i>
<i>trapping visitors inside.</i>

239
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:44,102
<i>Can you control it from there?</i>

240
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:47,301
<i>This is the Viking Ship!</i>
<i>The feed tank won't close...</i>

241
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:50,576
<i>the pool is overflowing!</i>
<i>Please do something!</i>

242
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:53,343
Mr. Egashira! It's still not too late!

243
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:54,919
Give the evacuation order!

244
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:58,547
This can't be.

245
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,053
Dammit!

246
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:03,893
Shimamoto! Hurry up and sound the alarm!

247
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,563
Kazuko!

248
00:23:10,135 --> 00:23:12,501
Looks like, we're too late.

249
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:14,731
Takeshi!

250
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:06,758
Shit! Hang in there, Tamami!

251
00:28:06,932 --> 00:28:09,025
Takeshi!

252
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:14,095
Don't let him commit anymore crimes.

253
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:18,072
It's like as if we were being led somewhere.

254
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:25,106
Kusakabe! So there you are.
I've been looking for you.

255
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,615
Let her go! I will take her place.

256
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:32,550
I want you to give this back to Kitazawa.
