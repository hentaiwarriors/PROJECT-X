1
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:18,173
The demons have awoken
to destroy Sid, the continent.

2
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,941
Alicia, the girl who is being sought
after by the Four Lords of Darkness...

3
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:26,607
saved us
with her mysterious powers.

4
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,317
There seems to be some sort of
connection between the two but...

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,149
who gives a damn!

6
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:35,349
They'll never have Alicia!

7
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:39,752
I can't have you defeated too.

8
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:43,427
- Let's go, girls!
- OK!

9
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:18,991
Ash.

10
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:20,402
Ash.

11
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:52,835
Ash!

12
00:01:53,303 --> 00:01:54,668
Ash!

13
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:07,877
That's...

14
00:02:07,984 --> 00:02:09,474
What is it this time!?

15
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:17,425
Lavialos!

16
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:23,495
Who the hell are you!?

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,598
Lavialos, there's no need for you.

18
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:31,771
Do you think you can triumph
over Alicia's powers?

19
00:02:31,874 --> 00:02:32,932
Lucretia.

20
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:36,975
Anyway, why don't we tell them?

21
00:02:37,714 --> 00:02:40,808
That Alicia is one of us.

22
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,279
That's a lie!

23
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,322
What the hell
are they talking about?

24
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:53,919
The power Alicia possesses is the power
that we, the Demon Clan, wield.

25
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:58,327
The emblem on her chest is
undeniable proof.

26
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:06,604
That can't be.

27
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,509
I'm a demon?

28
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:14,742
We have been slaughtering
the humans to find Alicia.

29
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:22,149
Then are you saying Sid became
stained with blood because of me?

30
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:25,225
Now, Alicia.

31
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:27,921
Come with us.

32
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:36,128
If I go, will the battle between
humans and demons end?

33
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:37,834
Yes.

34
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,104
If you wish for peace on Sid,
come with us.

35
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:46,074
Shut up!!

36
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:49,644
Enough of your babble, demons!

37
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,751
Ash!

38
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:01,923
Pests.

39
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:13,569
Without the help of Alicia's
demon powers, you are weaklings!

40
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:23,780
Stop! I'll kill myself
if you hurt Ash!

41
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:33,551
Will you promise me
peace over Sid?

42
00:04:34,364 --> 00:04:37,026
I promise, Alicia.

43
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,589
Come.

44
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:47,040
Alicia!

45
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,610
Don't be fooled, Alicia!

46
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:58,644
Alicia! Don't go!!

47
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:00,782
Ash.

48
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,882
Thank you for everything.

49
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:14,432
Aliciaaaa!

50
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:37,959
- Can I get that one?
- Thank you!

51
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:39,790
Be careful.

52
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:48,232
I can't believe that
Alicia was a demon.

53
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:51,067
So is everything back to normal?

54
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:54,268
It's probably a short-lived peace.

55
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,237
The demons have tasted
the flesh of young women.

56
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:00,781
I can't bring myself to believe
they'll stay quiet.

57
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,516
I'm through with this job!

58
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,657
Elliege!

59
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:11,084
Are you all crazy!?

60
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:15,286
There's no way we can win
against an army of monsters!

61
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:17,964
Plus, that reward ain't
enough for this job!

62
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:19,801
Gimme a break!

63
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:23,061
But you gambled away
all your reward money.

64
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,564
What about Alicia?

65
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:29,801
Abandoning a job you've already
accepted isn't exactly praiseworthy.

66
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:34,747
Elliege, please!
We need your Magnum!

67
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,649
Sorry, Ash.

68
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:06,380
Briggan and Amon's crystal weren't
able to seal Alicia's powers, but now...

69
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:11,452
our Demon Clan will rule Sid.
Right, Lavialos?

70
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:51,858
No!

71
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:53,688
No.

72
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:21,082
Are you thinking about Alicia?

73
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:24,123
Ah... No.

74
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:28,392
Because I'm half-human,
half-elf...

75
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:31,364
I was bullied a lot
when I was a child.

76
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:35,431
When I went to the village, I was
told to leave because I was an elf.

77
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:39,338
Then when I went to the forest, I was
told to leave because I was human.

78
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:42,269
But I was fine with that.

79
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:44,573
Because...

80
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,808
my father was completely in love
with my mother who was an elf...

81
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:51,375
and my mother was also completely in
love with my father who was a human.

82
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:54,052
Asti.

83
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:56,356
Even if Alicia is a demon...

84
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,984
if you love her,
you should go and get her back!

85
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:00,460
You're sweet...

86
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:04,489
I don't want to see you
just moping around.

87
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:13,971
Have you ever made love to
someone who wasn't human?

88
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:17,401
A... Ast...

89
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:26,151
I don't know
any other way to cheer you up.

90
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:40,224
It's so strange.

91
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:45,296
Our hearts are beating
so fast together and...

92
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:51,113
Why does everyone want to
make such a distinction...

93
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:54,175
between elves and humans?

94
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:57,683
You can love each other
even if she's a demon!

95
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:04,893
Ash.

96
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:07,089
Asti.

97
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:12,990
I want yours too.

98
00:10:34,123 --> 00:10:36,353
Asti, I'm coming in.

99
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:37,824
OK.

100
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,117
Ash.

101
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:18,323
Asti... Asti...

102
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:19,423
Ash!

103
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:21,456
There are tons of them.

104
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:23,564
There must be
a hundred thousand of them!

105
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:24,894
Bring it on!

106
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:26,897
I'll play with them!

107
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:28,731
They're not the
usual forest creatures.

108
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:31,339
An army of monsters...

109
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,965
- I've already made up my mind!
- Good!

110
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:07,829
Elliege!

111
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:09,768
Elliege!

112
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:12,099
- Elliege.
- Hey.

113
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:14,573
- You're late!
- You took so long!

114
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,574
- You came.
- I knew you would.

115
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,413
Geez! Without me
you guys are too dangerous!

116
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:29,153
They're coming!

117
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:39,263
Leave this to us.
Ash, go save Alicia!

118
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:42,364
Yeah, she's probably waiting for you.

119
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:44,803
When we finish here,
we'll head straight there.

120
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:47,901
Girls... Got it!

121
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:49,639
Let's do it!

122
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:50,803
OK!

123
00:15:06,595 --> 00:15:08,495
Ash, hurry and go!

124
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:10,155
Take care! Everyone!

125
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:23,473
Welcome, mortal Ash.

126
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,447
Lavialos!

127
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:28,081
How dare you deceive us!
Show yourself!

128
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:30,481
Where's Alicia?

129
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,712
Don't be so hasty.

130
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:39,158
Since you've come to my manor,
why not relax, mortal Ash?

131
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:42,422
We've only started...

132
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:59,205
Why are you going so far
to save Alicia, mortal Ash?

133
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:02,800
I am the one to be asking questions.
Why are you after Alicia?

134
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,149
In this world, there are some things
that humans shouldn't know.

135
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:18,723
But as a human,
you are a promising one.

136
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:31,734
Lord Harctune, who was sealed
away by God, exists in Alicia.

137
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:35,668
God?

138
00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:37,244
Harctune?

139
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:40,012
That light from her chest!?

140
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:44,211
In order for the Demon Clan to
rule this world instead of humans...

141
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,482
we must release Lord Harctune.

142
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:49,917
Enough of your selfish idealism!

143
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,829
What's wrong?

144
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,404
I thought you were going to
protect Alicia.

145
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:12,892
What's this! You cheated again!

146
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:15,128
Of course not.

147
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:24,941
Ash, you're home late.

148
00:20:25,414 --> 00:20:26,881
Do you want some Puar tea?

149
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:30,176
Ash! Elliege is being sneaky!

150
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:31,977
Alicia's in the back.

151
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:34,487
Hey! It's my turn to pick a card.

152
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:37,057
This time
I'll keep a sharp eye out.

153
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:38,524
I'm counting on you, Fromage.

154
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:09,683
He's here.

155
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:31,572
Alicia.

156
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:37,648
Give me back Alicia.

157
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:03,701
Aren't we impatient?

158
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:07,373
I'd like you to stop giving
the worthless humans your time!

159
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:22,088
Ash, will you protect me?

160
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:24,658
Yeah, I promise.

161
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,858
And when my friends come,
we'll get rid of the monsters in a flash.

162
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:30,903
They're really strong.

163
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:34,799
Forgive us, Alicia.

164
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:37,338
We weren't able to protect you.

165
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:40,645
But please understand this.

166
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:42,910
