1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:05,297
We'd been broken, but
time wasn't on our side...

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,670
ISHIKI FAMILY
Wake - June 17 (6:00 PM)
Funeral - June 18 (2:00 PM)

3
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,715
FAMILY IN MOURNING

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,517
The funeral...

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,017
That's when it all began.

6
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:25,182
No, it may have begun
even before then.

7
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,722
Our destiny may have
been decided before that.

8
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:34,300
Our freedom... To come and
go, to choose what to do...

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,602
Our will...

10
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,304
When that traffic accident
took our parents from us.

11
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,931
...we lost all of that.

12
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,871
This is your destiny now.

13
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:49,210
We were prisoners of a secret
organization and being trained.

14
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,887
We were both to be sold to a client...

15
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,514
...to become sex slaves.

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,917
Once we were "first-class women"...

17
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,984
...our client will make sure
we don't live in poverty.

18
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,824
This is the only life
we have to live now.

19
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,804
We have no other
options open to us.

20
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,210
If I can't do this, I'll be killed.

21
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,045
Leaving my sister alone.

22
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,947
Leaving me sister alone...

23
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,516
Sis...

24
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,618
This can't be...

25
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,108
This is reality.

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,589
Slave Sisters
(PART TWO)

27
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,631
My sister had learned of the
situation a little before I was told.

28
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:21,662
Urination...

29
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,277
Enemas...

30
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,212
Anal sex...

31
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,804
Vibrators...

32
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,582
Humiliation games...

33
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,751
Soft S&M...

34
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,685
Masturbation with aphrodisiacs...

35
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,449
Public sex...

36
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,127
Is this really...

37
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,657
Really... Really my sister?

38
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,198
This isn't the sister I know!

39
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,204
We once lived a normal life.

40
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,047
We had a house.

41
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,348
We had a home.

42
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,983
We had a family.

43
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,042
I can't say we were rich...

44
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,054
...but we weren't
desperately poor, either.

45
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,023
We were brought up like
so many other people.

46
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:15,192
She's devoted her mind, her
very being, to getting us money.

47
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,593
She's worked harder than I ever could.

48
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,599
To be kind to people.

49
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,367
She never let it show on her face...

50
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,097
...no matter how sad she
was or how bad things got.

51
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,501
She kept her wounds hidden inside.

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,676
She cries only when she's alone.

53
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,043
My gentle sister is
trying so hard for me...

54
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,848
So hard...

55
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,110
So hard...

56
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,781
Why did this happen?!
What are we both doing?!

57
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,822
I just want a normal life!

58
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,949
To live normally!
To find love normally!

59
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,357
To do normal things!

60
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,657
That man...

61
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,591
Yes, ever since we
first met that man...

62
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,574
Yeah! If we'd never met him...

63
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,178
...we'd both be living normal lives now!

64
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,736
Why did he have to show up?!

65
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,548
Shunji Iwashiro...

66
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,223
Shunji...

67
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,058
Why? Why?!

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,836
Why did it have to be Shunji?

69
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,771
I thought he was going to be...

70
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,035
...a nice, handsome big brother for me.

71
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,733
I was genuinely looking
forward to Sis marrying him!

72
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:43,345
I was ready to give
that man everything.

73
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,887
Wow, you don't say.

74
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,321
You're a funny girl,
you know that?

75
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,688
You bet!

76
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,818
And so cute and innocent, too.

77
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,792
Oh, you... You think so?

78
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,224
How... How do you feel
about girls like that, Shunji?

79
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,195
Hmm... Let's see...

80
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,199
They tend to be cheerful,
obedient, honest with themselves.

81
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,974
...and maybe a little selfish...

82
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,933
...but they're usually dedicated
and really very strong.

83
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,278
I like girls like that.

84
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,784
Girls like you, Miku.

85
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,412
R... Really?

86
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,477
I'm not like that at all!

87
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,653
Anyway, it's late. Better
go back to my room now.

88
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,030
G'night.

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,726
What's wrong?

90
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,845
I'd better go.

91
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,380
Yukari's waiting for me in our room.

92
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,540
I... I'm sorry!

93
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,381
This wasn't... I just... I mean...!

94
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,851
You're... You're engaged
to my sister, so...

95
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:03,960
Good night.

96
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,264
I loved you!

97
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,313
When I learned everything...

98
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,181
I accepted Shunji...

99
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,944
...and our destiny...

100
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,513
I thought I was prepared for it...

101
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,416
...but I couldn't stop crying.

102
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,753
Even though you'd decided to
give your virginity to Shunji...

103
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,698
Okay, yeah, I did think that, but...!

104
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,737
You wanted Shunji to do it to you.

105
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,274
No! Not like that!

106
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,037
But it doesn't change
anything, does it?

107
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,475
You're wrong! I did it for my sister!

108
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,237
Liar.

109
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,907
It was what you wanted whether
your sister was involved or not.

110
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,177
No! No!

111
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,215
You wished your sister
wasn't there to interfere.

112
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,222
I never thought that!

113
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,961
Even though you'd gladly
spread your legs for Shunji now.

114
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,191
It's not true! It's not!

115
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,695
You won't just do this for training.

116
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,030
You'll think about Shunji
and play with yourself...

117
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,865
Stop it! Don't say that!

118
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,503
It's fitting behavior for
a little slut like you.

119
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,806
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

120
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,544
Sis, it's not true! It's not!

121
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,276
It's not true!

122
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,249
Goodbye.

123
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,829
So, you're awake.

124
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,731
What's wrong? Tired?

125
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,700
Was I... asleep?

126
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,313
You were waiting
for me to wake up?

127
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,914
I figured it was time to take a break.

128
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:11,088
If you're tired, we can call it a night.

129
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,621
Is that all right?

130
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,296
Your training is going fairly well.

131
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,764
It's important for
you to get your rest.

132
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,896
You're so nice...

133
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,341
Yum...

134
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,772
I'm fine. A little nap and
I'm ready for anything.

135
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,106
TRAINING - DAY 25

136
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,453
Yes! Yes...!

137
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,894
Shunji!

138
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,861
I'm going to...!

139
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,733
It feels so good!

140
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,812
I love Shunji.

141
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,979
And I love my sister.

142
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,247
This may not be the
destiny I wanted...

143
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,027
How this crazy situation will turn out...

144
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,993
...I don't really know.

145
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:31,831
But no matter how hard or
sad this new life is for me...

146
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,896
...I think there are
small joys to be found.

147
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,041
And so, for now, I'll try my best...

148
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,569
...and try to live as best I can.

149
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,554
Slave Sisters
(PART TWO)

150
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,622
What is it?

151
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,698
I happened to
overhear a rumor.

152
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,033
Oh...?

153
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,103
That, lately, some of
our trained women...

154
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,606
...are being returned to us...

155
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,769
...for 20 to 30 percent
of their original price.

156
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,876
Yes. It's in response to requests
from some of our better clients.

157
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,175
Why?

158
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,776
I thought returns were
prohibited in our contracts.

159
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,581
If I don't take them
back at low prices...

160
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:28,024
...our clients will sell them cheaply
to amateurs and collectors.

161
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:33,031
That would send our
market value into a tailspin.

162
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,268
No, that's not what I meant.

163
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:40,432
Why would our clients want to
return such first-class women?

164
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,143
Because people have desires.

165
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,312
No matter how fine
a woman may be.

166
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,683
...after a few years they
seem to want a new one.

167
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,480
A different type than
what they have now.

168
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,787
Something newer and better.

169
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,381
Well, you know how it is.

170
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,686
My God. These aren't
things we're talking about.

171
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,249
Yes, they are.

172
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,431
As a trainer, you see
them as individual people.

173
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,922
To our clients,
they are merely...

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,198
...things which exist
to fulfill their desires.

175
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,307
Don't be upset.

176
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:19,512
All the returned women are
collected by our organization.

177
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,539
The foreign market for
them has expanded lately.

178
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,741
A the market price rises,
we'll still make a profit.

179
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,255
The women you turn out
are highly sought after.

180
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,119
They fly off the shelves, so to speak.

181
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,184
It won't affect you at
this point. Don't worry.

182
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,234
In the end, even if I make
them as good as they can be.

183
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:45,931
...they still won't be able to
find any happiness, will they?

184
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,268
What the hell am I doing?

185
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,009
TRAINING - DAY 30

186
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,768
Hey, Shunji...

187
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,570
Or should I call you Shun-chan?

188
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,970
I remember when we were kids...

189
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:27,179
Your family moved into
the condo next door to us.

190
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,615
...and we used to play
together all the time.

191
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,610
I think we used to talk all the time.

192
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,888
Don't you remember?

193
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,091
It was only for a year.

194
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:44,151
And then your family moved again.

195
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,663
I remember it so well.

196
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:51,403
I never thought we'd
meet again like this...

197
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,665
Stop it!

198
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,274
Don't think about it! And also...

199
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,745
Never call me Shun-chan
again! Is that clear?!

200
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:02,781
Yes, sir.

201
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,070
Hey, Shunji...

202
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,241
So, you once knew
the older sister, huh?

203
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,573
I'd forgotten, but
it looks like I did.

204
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:39,547
Maybe she's hallucinating.
That girl's snapped.

205
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,688
We still don't know that.

206
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,849
I'm impressed, Mr. Iwashiro.

207
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:49,987
Even if she's returned, she'll
still sell for a good price.

208
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,432
She may be nuts, but
she's a tiger in bed...

209
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,468
...although she goes
at it a little too hard.

210
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,571
She's just a nymphomaniac now, right?

211
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,574
Although inside her head... Well...

212
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,772
I wonder how well a client will
treat a brain-damaged woman.

213
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,304
Right, Mr. Iwashiro?

214
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,014
TRAINING - DAY 45

215
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,397
Hey, what's happening with my sister?

216
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,267
You're worried about her?

217
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,566
Have you and she been
doing it day after day?

218
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,232
Yeah. Because this is my job.

219
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,578
You'll be with Yukari again soon.

220
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,083
You two are going to
try some lesbian sex.

221
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,414
And then menage a trois.

222
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,247
But... I can't...!

223
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,149
You've learned all
sorts of techniques.

224
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,117
Use them on your
sister as best you can.

225
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,824
You said you would do
your best, like her, right?

226
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,601
Can my sister really...?

227
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,401
Don't worry. Yukari said she'd
be happy to do it with you.

228
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,973
I don't know how to do lesbian sex.

229
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,212
Just do what you want.

230
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,613
What you want to do and
what makes you feel good.

231
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:22,085
And then do to your partner the
things that feel good to you.

232
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:27,057
Do this to make both you
and your sister feel good.

233
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,458
You must always keep your
partner's feelings in mind.

234
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,657
Just do it as you do it with me.

235
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,128
Do that, and your body
will move naturally.

236
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,567
Sis...

237
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,379
Shunji...

238
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,176
You know what?

239
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,877
I've been having this dream
since we started the training.

240
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,217
Stretching out all around me...

241
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,317
...are the sands of a huge desert.

242
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,761
I'm walking through it, all alone...

243
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,368
Day after day after day...

244
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,438
...I keep on walking, as
though wandering and lost.

245
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,040
My mind and body changing...

246
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,032
Becoming worn down
to be another person.

247
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,908
And then a voice cries
out from somewhere.

248
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,669
It's you and I, doing it.

249
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,706
At first, I was embarrassed and scared.

250
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,936
I just wanted to run away.

251
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:56,915
But something would hold
me back before I could run.

252
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,248
Day after day after
day, I had this dream.

253
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:05,779
But as the days passed,
as I kept watching...

254
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:10,392
...I saw the me in the
dream looked so happy.

255
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,590
How she felt so good
doing it with you.

256
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,791
And as I watched, I... I...

257
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:37,213
I was getting off on
watching us have sex.

258
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,553
It makes me laugh for some reason.

259
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,128
I must be losing my mind.

260
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,799
You see, me playing with
myself isn't enough.

261
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,965
I go to the me that's having
sex with you in my dream.

262
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,807
...and kill her.

263
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,740
And then...

264
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,651
...in the dream, you and I...

265
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,585
...just fuck and fuck.

266
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,817
Over and over...

267
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,324
I keep taking you again and again...

268
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,796
Until I wake up.

269
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,899
It's gone on day after day.

270
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,606
I kill myself in the
dream for that reason.

271
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,611
What do you suppose it all means?

272
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,511
That...

273
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,107
...it doesn't matter.

274
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,144
I suppose you're right.

275
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,987
Your training's over for today.

276
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,892
But I... I want more!

277
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,364
I want to do it with you.

278
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,229
I want to feel good.

279
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,629
Don't worry. Just sleep there, Shunji.

280
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,234
I'll do it all by myself.

281
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,719
Yukari...

282
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,196
Menage a trois tomorrow?
It's almost over.

283
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,628
What did you call Mr.
Ishihara about yesterday?

284
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,434
You've seemed strange since then.

285
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,101
It turns out this isn't
my last job after all.

286
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,335
So, it's not so easy to
leave this business, is it?

287
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,509
You'll work and work
for the organization.

288
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,713
Training women forever.

289
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:28,249
Working for our clients to
make sex slaves for them.

290
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,026
That is your destiny.

291
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,664
And yours.

292
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:38,065
I'm going to get to
the top at any cost.

293
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,504
Sis...

294
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:40,493
Miku...

295
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,302
TRAINING - DAY 49

296
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,178
Sis, you've changed.

297
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,670
Have I? You seem to have
been trying hard, too.

298
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,179
Look how that's changed!

299
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,579
Stop! Sis, not so fast...!

300
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,923
Sh- Shunji's watching us!

301
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,231
No! This is wrong!
Sisters shouldn't do this!

302
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,700
Well, Miku? Doesn't it feel good?

303
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,930
Your little pussy tastes so good...

304
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,502
Sis...!

305
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,409
Relax a little more.

306
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,208
What cute little breasts...

307
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,329
What did you just say?!

308
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:41,767
You can't leave the
organization just yet.

309
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,961
But, you said...

310
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,400
There's still some
interest left to pay off.

311
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,474
N... No... How much longer?!

312
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,308
Oh, you'll pay it off soon.
Don't worry about it.

313
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,540
Yes, sir.

314
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,950
Hmm... You're taking this rather well.

315
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,020
I thought you were desperate
to leave the business.

316
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:06,183
I've learned over the years
that resistance is futile.

317
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,957
Well, once you've finished
with those sisters...

318
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,496
...you can train me some new girls.

319
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,469
Well?

320
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,872
So good! It feels so good, Sis!

321
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,066
To me, too.

322
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,035
I'm going to...!

323
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,354
Miku...

324
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,481
Now you do me, okay?

325
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,650
Lick me!

326
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,693
What's wrong?

327
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,424
Just lick me gently, like
you do to Shunji's dick.

328
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,488
Do this to make both you
and your sister feel good.

329
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,558
You must always keep your
partner's feelings in mind.

330
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,263
Just do it as you do it with me.

331
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:57,069
Do that, and your body
will move naturally.

332
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,384
Yes, that's the way, Miku...

333
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,785
Yes! Right there! That feels so good...

334
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,779
Yes!

335
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,238
Hey, Shunji...

336
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,401
I wonder if I'm losing my mind.

337
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:35,010
If I... If I do lose it...

338
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,412
If I do...

339
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,648
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

340
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,123
No, I guess not.

341
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,491
That's one thing you can't do for me.

342
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,758
Sorry for asking such an odd thing.

343
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,969
Okay, Miku. Here we go.

344
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,035
That big thing won't fit in me!

345
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,904
It'll be fine. Just relax.

346
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,088
I'm going to come!

347
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,633
No... No more...!

348
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,636
We're just getting started!

349
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:35,474
Shunji, would you...
Go in from the rear.

350
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,169
Shunji, please!

351
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,041
Hurry! Do it, please!

352
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,275
Shunji...

353
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:45,681
Yes!

354
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,082
Yukari, why don't we...

355
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,816
Why don't we run far away?

356
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,325
Do you love me?

357
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,369
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

358
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,570
Do you understand?

359
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,840
No, I don't think I do.

360
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,843
Something in my heart feels warm.

361
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,777
And it feels natural to cry.

362
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,780
What's wrong with me?

363
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,346
Never mind. Never mind...

364
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,683
Let's end this.

365
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,222
Miku...

366
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,799
So, you're awake.

367
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,361
Good morning.

368
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,508
We've been here for three days.

369
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,806
How do you like living here?

370
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,279
A long as you're here, Shunji...

371
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,841
A long as I can love you every
day, from morning till night.

372
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,979
Just that makes me happy.

373
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:30,981
I see...

374
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,791
We'll always be together from now on.

375
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,158
Yes. I'm glad...

376
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,398
Come to me!

377
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,194
It looks like they're here.

378
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,932
A long as I'm with you...

379
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:20,165
I'll go anywhere.
And I won't be afraid.

380
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:24,275
Just stay inside me.
Until the end...

381
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,765
I understand.

382
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,565
Three days...

383
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,863
It took you longer
than I expected.

384
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,401
TRAINING - DAY 56

385
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:57,969
Yes. Yes. I see.
Understood.

386
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:02,037
Your sister and Shunji
Iwashiro are dead.

387
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,315
The poor fool...

388
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,513
You're really running
away with the older one?

389
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,550
What's happened to you?

390
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,559
You've fallen in love
with the merchandise?

391
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,494
That's not like you.

392
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:19,964
I'm just... I'm just
tired of everything.

393
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,500
Someday, you'll
understand, too.

394
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,400
You'll never get away.

395
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,938
What about Miku?

396
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:30,475
If I take her as well, it'll
cause trouble for you.

397
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:34,309
Besides, she's still
sane. And she's young.

398
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:38,338
I'd rather she live a while
longer than take her with us.

399
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,944
There's happiness in life,
even as merchandise?

400
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,487
I have one favor to ask.

401
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:50,291
Hypnotize her to forget
about Yukari and me.

402
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,598
No need to ask.
I'll erase all feelings...

403
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,896
...that interfere with her duties.

404
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,904
It's better if she forgets.

405
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,395
Just leave the message
to live as best she can.

406
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,371
What's wrong?
You're stopping!

407
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,583
I don't have a sister...

408
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,919
...and I've never heard of
anyone named Shunji before.

409
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,356
...but I feel a stab
deep in my heart...

410
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,325
...and feel a little sad.

411
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,961
And... And...

412
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,395
And I'm starting to
cry for some reason.

413
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,528
Why is that?

414
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,135
Some lingering memories...?

415
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:33,104
No matter. I have four more days.

416
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,402
No need to rush your training.

417
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:39,173
What's wrong with you?!
Start sucking!

418
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,868
Y... Yes, sir.
