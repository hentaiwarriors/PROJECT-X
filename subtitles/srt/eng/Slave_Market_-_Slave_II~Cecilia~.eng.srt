1
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:15,130
What? An arranged marriage!?

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,099
Yes, they requested you
specifically.

3
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:23,302
He's the Prince of Savoia!
It's amazingly fortunate!

4
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,167
Y-yes.

5
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:36,481
I hope that he's a wonderful prince.

6
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:53,868
No!!

7
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,497
Open the door!

8
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:03,342
Whoa! This way's a dead end.

9
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,304
- No! Let me go!!
- Keep still!

10
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:14,650
I beg you, help me!!
Please!!

11
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,852
We've cornered your prey over here,
my Prince.

12
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:22,661
Well done, Bougette.

13
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,760
What do you think?
A splendid prey, is she not?

14
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:31,668
Yes. Not bad for a girl
from lower class royalty.

15
00:01:31,907 --> 00:01:35,001
No!! Please, someone save me!!

16
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:38,235
No! Please stop it!

17
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:43,285
Stop! Don't!

18
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:45,378
Hey, calm down now.

19
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:58,598
Well, here we go!

20
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:46,414
Slave Market (Dorei Ichiba)

21
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:57,681
What's with the face?
It's not like you're the one being sold.

22
00:02:58,126 --> 00:03:01,095
No, I'm just not
used to the smell.

23
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:07,030
Soon your dick will get hard
just from this smell. Come on.

24
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:08,469
Yeah.

25
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:11,765
I've come to this place again.

26
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,310
I thought I would never see it again,
but this is for the mission.

27
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:20,005
Palvis.

28
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:23,007
Yes! What is it, ambassador?

29
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:28,613
It seems that you like our slave girls.

30
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,949
W-well, I...
You see...

31
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:36,991
I am not judging you.
In fact, I encourage this behavior.

32
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,297
No one will suspect someone who
buys many slaves to be leaving soon.

33
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:46,797
B-but she has already...

34
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:49,243
Yes, I'm already aware.

35
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:55,577
I will issue you some funds.
What you do with it is up to you.

36
00:03:56,017 --> 00:03:57,075
Thank you, sir.

37
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,313
My mission, in the event that
war becomes unavoidable,

38
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:05,248
is to get the information back to
the Republic as soon as possible.

39
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:13,625
Until then, the enemy cannot
know I am the informant.

40
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:20,539
This immoral action would seem
to be the perfect cover.

41
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:26,004
Unfortunately, this is not enough
to give her to you.

42
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:29,640
There must be something! Help me out!

43
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:32,346
I'm sorry, sir, but you must leave.

44
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:35,790
I guess you'll have to give up.

45
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:37,514
Give up? But...

46
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,094
We have to head back for now.

47
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:42,864
- H-hey! Quit pulling me, Ruka!
- They look like mercenaries.

48
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:45,230
Maybe they fell in
love with a slave?

49
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:04,374
I'm sorry to make you wait.
So, any girls you have your eye on?

50
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:09,180
Yeah, this one isn't bad.
What do you think, Casius?

51
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:10,991
How about that blonde haired girl?

52
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:16,959
Oh, that girl.
Come here, it's a customer!

53
00:05:20,468 --> 00:05:24,268
This slave was born to a
good family in Lombardia.

54
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,373
I guarantee she can do housework,
read, and write.

55
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:34,839
A perfect mistress for a soldier
living alone, I would think.

56
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:42,080
Wait a minute, you fox.
You're trying to sell us damaged goods!

57
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:46,690
Look at those haughty eyes.

58
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:56,496
She's not a virgin. I knew it.

59
00:05:58,273 --> 00:06:02,073
Oh, strong willed, eh? Take that!

60
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:04,367
Hey, Falco!

61
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:15,022
I-I'm very sorry. It is my fault that
I brought out a non-virgin.

62
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:21,353
But this slave does not have
a mark on her, inside or out.

63
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:25,023
She's ideal to use as you see fit,
and beautiful as well.

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,664
Don't bother. She's not a virgin,
and she has a bad personality.

65
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,806
No, I'll take her.

66
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,612
Hey,
Look, I'm warning you...

67
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,485
No, I've decided. I like those eyes.

68
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:50,613
Well, it's not my place to
tell you what you like...

69
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,454
Thank you very much.

70
00:06:59,234 --> 00:07:01,725
The girl was delivered to me
the same day.

71
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:06,305
They had put her in an expensive
dress and cleaned her.

72
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:13,105
Her beautiful hair glistened in the sun,
and smelled of fresh cream.

73
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:16,748
What is it?

74
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,653
Well, there's no point in standing there.
Come in. I'll give you a tour.

75
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,288
It's not very big, but it's more
than enough for two...

76
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:32,189
I know you've been through a lot,

77
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:36,961
but I want you to relax and
use this place as if it were your own.

78
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:38,406
Oh...

79
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:42,809
Oh, I... umm...
Can you cook?

80
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:44,411
Yes...

81
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:52,450
Oh. I-It can be whenever you want.
I... don't want a servant.

82
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,447
Then what do you want?

83
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:18,578
Well I... I just wanted
to help you. That's all.

84
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:22,176
And how did you end up being here?

85
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,243
It's none of your business!

86
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:58,143
Wow, it's been a while since
I had such a feast.

87
00:08:58,486 --> 00:08:59,418
Oh...

88
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:06,727
When I come back from my mission...
uh... from work, this'll be heaven.

89
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:08,119
From work?

90
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:13,733
I have a position at the Venetian embassy.

91
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:18,166
Oh, It's a little late, but I'm
Casius of Venice of the Palvis House.

92
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:21,267
Come to think of it,
I haven't caught your name yet.

93
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:23,870
I'm Cecilia.

94
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:26,979
Cecilia, huh?
I'll be counting on you.

95
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:38,823
C-Cecilia. W-wait, Cecilia.
That's not what I meant.

96
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,755
Then, what did you mean?

97
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,360
I... I just wanted
to say good night.

98
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:54,309
You really spent all that money,
just to rescue me?!

99
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:59,747
O-of course. I just...
I don't expect you to believe me.

100
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,739
S-stop that!

101
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:07,021
You're getting all hard, and you
expect me to believe you?

102
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:11,424
I c-can't help it.
I-It's just built that way.

103
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:22,468
You're just too cute.

104
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:24,562
W-what are you doing?

105
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:28,042
You can't sleep like this, right?

106
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:09,373
S-sorry, looks like it still
has some energy.

107
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:22,088
It's so strange.

108
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:27,195
I always thought men were filthy.

109
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:32,303
But you're clean,
smooth, and so pretty.

110
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:45,909
You're beautiful.

111
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:49,778
Don't stare at me.

112
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:51,240
Cecilia.

113
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:26,019
Flora...

114
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:34,757
From that day, we started acting
like a couple in love.

115
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:39,492
But I knew that it was all a lie.

116
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:45,397
If war started, then I would have
to go on my mission,

117
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:49,209
and Cecilia refused to speak
about her past.

118
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:54,980
We were simply looking away from reality,
and trying to be happy.

119
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:57,412
This momentary happiness...

120
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,079
Y-you! You're Cecilia, aren't you!

121
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,052
I finally found you,
you little cunt-on-wheels!

122
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:07,628
No!!

123
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:09,119
Come back here!

124
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:14,056
What's the meaning of this!
How dare you call the lady that!

125
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:19,534
Bastard! Do you know I am
Bougette of Savoia?!

126
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,537
Fine, then. I will have your hide
for this. I swear!

127
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:31,516
Cecilia...

128
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:39,484
Cecilia! Cecilia, what is it?
What happened?

129
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:42,586
I... I...

130
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:49,200
Don't be scared. I'm right here.
I'll protect you.

131
00:14:57,378 --> 00:15:01,212
I was born in Lombardia, in Verona.

132
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:06,747
But I was born as peasant royalty,
to a family no one remembers.

133
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:11,815
Then one day, I was taken to the castle
in the Savoia Kingdom.

134
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:13,691
The Savoia Kingdom?!

135
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:17,122
Yes. They told me it was
an arranged marriage.

136
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:22,865
But I found out later that
my parents needed money.

137
00:15:23,904 --> 00:15:24,928
T-they didn't?

138
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,469
They got 100 florins for
handing me to the kingdom.

139
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:35,272
Only 100 florins?!!

140
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,780
I never cared about money!
I didn't mind being peasant royalty!

141
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:50,686
That pig of a prince was already
promised to a French princess.

142
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:54,000
He wanted to get some actual
experience before the real thing...

143
00:15:55,236 --> 00:16:00,173
A little more, Prince!
Bring glory to the Savoia kingdom!

144
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:08,475
Even after that, I was put into a
dirty room, becoming the pig's toy.

145
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,817
I wanted to die, but I couldn't.

146
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:24,421
I later found out I was pregnant.

147
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,863
Since I was no longer useful,
they sold me off to pirates...

148
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,001
and this is where I ended up.

149
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:37,339
I'm sorry. I made you relive
such a painful experience.

150
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:47,814
And the child?

151
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:52,323
At first, I didn't want that man's child.

152
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:57,223
But then, all I had was her.
All I had was Flora!

153
00:16:58,232 --> 00:17:03,693
But she was sold off
and sent away too.

154
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:06,798
I have nothing now...

155
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,477
You have me. I'll always be here
to protect you.

156
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:29,319
Please, don't let me go!
Make me forget about the past!

157
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:36,700
Yes?

158
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:39,796
Yo, sorry to come suddenly.

159
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:42,199
And you are?

160
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:46,108
I'm Doracua, the leader of the
mercenary band Dragon Fire.

161
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:48,048
This is my second, Ruka.

162
00:17:48,048 --> 00:17:50,209
Of course, there's only two of us.

163
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:52,978
Shut up. Let me do the talking.

164
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,756
So... what can I do for you?

165
00:17:55,756 --> 00:18:00,557
Well, there's something I want to discuss.
Will you invite us in?

166
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:03,593
Is everything alright?

167
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:07,624
It's fine. Go back to your room,
and I'll take care of it.

168
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:13,968
Sorry, but aside from me,
there's a lady here,

169
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:17,342
and I'm not allowing
any strangers in the house.

170
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:21,781
The girl that was at Bytone's, right?
We need to borrow her.

171
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:26,152
I don't care what the circumstances are...
I don't care to hear them.

172
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:30,323
Whoa! Don't say that.
At least hear what we have to say!

173
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:35,317
We've been employed by
a Savoian named Bougette.

174
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:36,696
What!?

175
00:18:38,232 --> 00:18:43,260
Look, listen to the whole story.
We're here to rescue Cecilia.

176
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:51,876
These strange mercenaries were hired
by Bougette to look for Cecilia.

177
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,515
According to them, they found out
their underhanded dealings, and...

178
00:18:55,916 --> 00:19:00,876
decided to go back on their word,
and help the poor slave girl.

179
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:07,621
But why are they still after Cecilia?
What business do they have with her?

180
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:12,564
They're not after Cecilia.
It's her daughter, Flora.

181
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,392
Huh? What do you mean?

182
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:18,669
It seems the Savoian Prince
Bowman died suddenly.

183
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,932
Apparently, without conceiving an
heir with the French princess.

184
00:19:23,444 --> 00:19:27,642
So they're looking for someone
who carries on the royal bloodline.

185
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:33,275
I see. But it's no use.
Cecilia doesn't know where she is either.

186
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:36,013
We know where the girl is.

187
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:37,986
What?
Are you serious?

188
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:42,685
Yeah, we found her in the hands
of some merchant.

189
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,958
And Doracua said he'd never let that
dirty Savoian have the kid,

190
00:19:48,402 --> 00:19:50,563
so once again, we lose out
on getting our money.

191
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:52,462
Hey, it can't be helped...!

192
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,837
Where is Flora?!

193
00:19:58,412 --> 00:20:03,440
Don't worry.
Flora is in a safe place.

194
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:04,809
Is that true?!

195
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:10,122
Yeah. I may not look it, but I have
pull with the Duke of Ferrara.

196
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:13,084
It's an easy thing to hide
a mother and daughter.

197
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:15,027
What? Then you...

198
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:19,827
Yeah, we were going to take you
to where you daughter is.

199
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:23,063
Really?! I can really see Flora again?!

200
00:20:23,804 --> 00:20:27,365
Yes. And to prove it, we
brought you this.

201
00:20:28,642 --> 00:20:29,404
Here.

202
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:32,345
This is the doll she always held...

203
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:37,081
I can't let you take Cecilia.

204
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:44,418
Please leave now.
This girl is mine.

205
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:46,525
Maybe you should rethink that.

206
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,722
If you don't leave...

207
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:55,769
You think you stand a chance?
You barely have field experience.

208
00:20:56,704 --> 00:21:00,936
We don't want to hurt you.
So please rethink your decision.

209
00:21:10,117 --> 00:21:13,780
They stink of lies.
Don't trust them.

210
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,982
Please! Let me go with them!

211
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,692
You would trust those
dirty mercs over me!?

212
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:26,232
I'm sorry.

213
00:21:31,105 --> 00:21:32,572
You're running away from me?!

214
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:37,076
Stop! Not here!

215
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:38,144
Shut up!

216
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:02,861
No! Not like this!

217
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:10,243
P-please, remove the chains.

218
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,538
I-I can't hold it!

219
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:18,884
What can't you hold?
Answer me!

220
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:22,780
Y-you know what!
I can't hold it in!

221
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:25,855
I see... I understand.

222
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,957
H-hurry... Wait!
Where are you going!?

223
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:32,859
You're not serious!

224
00:22:35,102 --> 00:22:36,069
We'll do this.

225
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:38,432
No! Not right here!

226
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:40,903
Quiet down!

227
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,747
You bastard!

228
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:53,208
What is it?

229
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,250
Please! Don't look! Look away!

230
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:04,496
Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!!

231
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:17,635
You bastard! You say you want to help
but you're no different from the pig!

232
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:26,416
Stop it, you jerk! That hurts!

233
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:32,058
You lie. Look how much filthy
juice is flowing from you.

234
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:35,189
What... What are you...!?

235
00:23:35,863 --> 00:23:38,599
Now, let's see about over here.

236
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,032
No! Not there!

237
00:23:58,318 --> 00:24:00,843
Sorry to interrupt the fun.

238
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:13,167
No! Stop! Stop!

239
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:15,761
If you tell us where the
girl is, we will stop.

240
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:18,599
I don't know! I really don't know!

241
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,406
You bitch.
You underestimate me.

242
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:24,878
Do it.

243
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:32,410
W-what?
What are you doing? S-stop!!

244
00:24:33,353 --> 00:24:34,285
S-stop...!

245
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:38,926
- Stop, stop... I don't know! I don't know!
- Now... if you don't tell me...

246
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:40,154
- Stop!
- Do it!

247
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:48,928
C-Cecilia!!

248
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:52,799
Well? Are you ready to talk?

249
00:24:53,106 --> 00:24:54,573
What's going on?!

250
00:25:01,582 --> 00:25:03,049
Y-you bastards!!!

251
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:33,305
C-Cecilia...

252
00:25:34,414 --> 00:25:36,780
Sorry, but we're taking the girl.

253
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,847
And I don't forgive guys
who make a lady cry.

254
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,157
Don't!

255
00:25:46,526 --> 00:25:48,323
Why would you... save him?

256
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:56,528
He may be a bad man,
but there was a time that he was kind.

257
00:26:04,678 --> 00:26:05,645
Cecilia!

258
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:07,113
Hold on.

259
00:26:16,156 --> 00:26:17,123
Here.

260
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:25,193
Thank you.
I'll only remember your kind side.

261
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:27,023
Goodbye.

262
00:26:27,634 --> 00:26:28,794
Let's hurry...

263
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:37,233
I could do nothing as I watched
them leave, their images fading.

264
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:43,082
In my heart, I was crying out
Cecilia's name over and over.

265
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:53,183
As Falco once said, we would all be
swept into the insanity of war...

266
00:26:55,395 --> 00:27:00,059
and I was to meet one
more fated woman.
