1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:01,554
 

2
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:03,954
Master Briggan, she is not the one.

3
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:04,324
 

4
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:05,655
Find her.

5
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:06,126
 

6
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:09,095
I need the girl with
an emblem on her chest!

7
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:13,600
 

8
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,467
You can have her.

9
00:01:16,467 --> 00:02:47,327
 

10
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:50,057
I'm Ash,
a popular adventurer for hire.

11
00:02:50,057 --> 00:02:50,730
 

12
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,029
As an adventurer, I'm paid to slay
monsters that have suddenly...

13
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:54,133
 

14
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:58,297
appeared on Sid Continent.
A monster hunter if you will.

15
00:02:58,297 --> 00:02:59,172
 

16
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:01,766
My next job is for
the village chief of Tylling...

17
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:01,874
 

18
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:05,071
a small village
on the edge of the continent.

19
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:14,721
 

20
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:15,688
That way!

21
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,122
 

22
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:18,147
Cries of help call to me.

23
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:31,271
 

24
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:34,104
Come here my dear.

25
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:36,309
 

26
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:39,540
- Come here!
- Don't come any closer!!

27
00:03:39,540 --> 00:04:17,116
 

28
00:04:17,116 --> 00:04:18,208
Are you all right?

29
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:18,318
 

30
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:19,615
Y- yes.

31
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:19,719
 

32
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,311
Who!? Who are you!?

33
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:21,621
 

34
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:26,558
Big guys like yourselves shouldn't
pick on a girl, you know.

35
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,827
 

36
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:28,816
Go!!

37
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:59,258
 

38
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,624
G... Go!!

39
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:31,557
 

40
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:32,524
Damn it!!

41
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:32,925
 

42
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:34,688
This is endless!

43
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:35,962
 

44
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:37,293
See ya!

45
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:46,005
 

46
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,439
After them!
Don't let them get away!

47
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:54,914
 

48
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:57,041
And... you are!?

49
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:57,550
 

50
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,211
Me? I'm Ash.

51
00:05:59,211 --> 00:05:59,318
 

52
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,513
Leave the monsters to me.

53
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:01,621
 

54
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:02,986
Ash!?

55
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:03,423
 

56
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:05,516
I've been waiting for you!!

57
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:05,792
 

58
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:08,056
I've come from Tylling to get you.

59
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:08,161
 

60
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:09,355
What!?

61
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:09,462
 

62
00:06:09,462 --> 00:06:12,260
There's a shortcut
to the village over there!

63
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:21,808
 

64
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:23,503
- Let's hurry!
- Ok.

65
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:37,156
 

66
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:39,886
- Is there something wrong?
- Huh? Um... N... nothing!!

67
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:43,629
 

68
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:45,722
Ash, you're a pervert.

69
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:46,966
 

70
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:51,130
I'll navigate from behind.
Ash, please go in front.

71
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:51,237
 

72
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:53,102
Yeah. Yeah.

73
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:55,408
 

74
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:58,571
She called me a pervert...

75
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:07,854
 

76
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:12,621
Thank you for coming such a long way.
Welcome to the village of Tylling.

77
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:12,725
 

78
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,056
Sir Ash.

79
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:14,494
 

80
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:18,760
Father, Ash has already saved me.

81
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:18,865
 

82
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:20,890
Oh! Thank you!

83
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,300
 

84
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,135
You must be tired. Let us continue
this conversation at the manor.

85
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:31,244
 

86
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:32,802
Until now, the monsters...

87
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:33,179
 

88
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:38,048
stayed on Demon Mountain
and never came to the village but...

89
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:38,217
 

90
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:39,616
did you know...

91
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:40,219
 

92
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:45,122
long ago, there was once
another continent west of Sid?

93
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:45,458
 

94
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,518
Yeah. I heard
it vanished overnight.

95
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,763
 

96
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:55,791
The "Ancient Ones," from the legends,
built four Pillars of Light...

97
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:55,902
 

98
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:59,599
surrounding the continent
and washed everything away.

99
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:34,140
 

100
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,543
It seems the Pillars of Light
have been erected once more.

101
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:38,811
 

102
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:43,441
Are you saying the light
created those monsters?

103
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:43,983
 

104
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:48,920
A villager who barely escaped alive
says he saw the Pillar of Light...

105
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,021
 

106
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:51,819
deep within the caverns of
Demon Mountain.

107
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:56,429
 

108
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:59,364
Next is Sid Continent then...?

109
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:00,566
 

110
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:02,329
I do not know that but...

111
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:02,868
 

112
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:06,861
My concern is the monsters.

113
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:07,640
 

114
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,043
For some reason, they keep
abducting the young girls...

115
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:12,144
 

116
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:17,207
Now all that's left is Alicia.

117
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:22,121
 

118
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:27,718
If the legend is involved,
it's not the usual monster hunt!

119
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:28,427
 

120
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:29,826
I do know this.

121
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:31,097
 

122
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:34,032
All of my friends
have been abducted...

123
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:34,533
 

124
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,730
The other day
it was my childhood friend, Les.

125
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,337
 

126
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:42,433
Please, Ash!
Please slay the monsters!

127
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:55,054
 

128
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:56,783
Ok. I'll take the job.

129
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:57,957
 

130
00:09:57,957 --> 00:10:01,085
Even I'll have problems
if the ground is gone.

131
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:02,962
 

132
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:05,192
But before that,
I'll need some time.

133
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:49,975
 

134
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:51,067
Hey!!

135
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,878
 

136
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:54,470
You girls were pretty fast!

137
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,580
 

138
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,879
You asked us to hurry,
so we came as fast as we could.

139
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:57,983
 

140
00:10:57,983 --> 00:10:59,007
I see.

141
00:10:59,007 --> 00:10:59,118
 

142
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,244
- Fa-Fa.
- Hi!

143
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:00,352
 

144
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:01,512
- Nagi.
- Hey.

145
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:01,620
 

146
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,019
- Asti.
- Hiya.

147
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:03,122
 

148
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,714
- Fromage.
- Hi!

149
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:04,824
 

150
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:06,553
- Tanya.
- Long time no see!

151
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:07,760
 

152
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,727
Where's Elliege?

153
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:08,828
 

154
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:10,523
We were together
up till now but...

155
00:11:10,523 --> 00:11:11,230
 

156
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,323
She went straight to the bar.

157
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:14,033
 

158
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,227
Again?

159
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:21,240
 

160
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,368
Sorry, guys!
Seems like I win again!

161
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:24,477
 

162
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,240
Thank you! Thank you!

163
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,216
 

164
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:32,650
How about another hand!?

165
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,552
 

166
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:35,577
- Ou! Ou! Ou!!
- Who are you!?

167
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:35,688
 

168
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:37,485
I need to borrow her
for a minute, guys.

169
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:37,590
 

170
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,582
Fuck off, Ash!
We're just getting started!!

171
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:40,893
 

172
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:42,383
You can have this back.

173
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:42,495
 

174
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:44,224
What did you do that for?
Asshole!

175
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:44,330
 

176
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,696
- You probably cheated anyway!
- That bitch!

177
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:48,567
 

178
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,432
Pillar of Light?

179
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:50,703
 

180
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:52,864
This job is going to be difficult.

181
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:53,105
 

182
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:55,699
Hey, with everyone's weapons
and my magnum...

183
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:55,808
 

184
00:11:55,808 --> 00:11:57,776
we can finish the job like always!

185
00:11:57,776 --> 00:11:57,943
 

186
00:11:57,943 --> 00:11:59,535
So what are we going to do?

187
00:11:59,535 --> 00:11:59,645
 

188
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:01,476
We leave here
early tomorrow morning.

189
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:01,847
 

190
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,941
We infiltrate Demon Mountain
and kill their leader.

191
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:05,050
 

192
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,109
Until then,
everyone get some rest.

193
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:07,219
 

194
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:12,179
Why didn't you say so, Ash!?
Then off I go to get some rest!

195
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,793
 

196
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,988
Gambling's calling me!

197
00:12:15,988 --> 00:13:16,889
 

198
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,686
It's an enemy attack!!

199
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:19,124
 

200
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:21,490
It's monsters! Run!!

201
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,461
 

202
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:25,021
Come to get killed, monsters!?

203
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:30,936
 

204
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,302
- I'm here to help!
- Nagi!!

205
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:33,906
 

206
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:35,498
As you can see...

207
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:41,580
 

208
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,380
Ash, come back! Alicia's...

209
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:45,885
 

210
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:49,286
Damn it! They're decoys!
Nagi, take care of this!

211
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,624
 

212
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:52,591
Let me go!

213
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:52,791
 

214
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,554
Let them go, you monster!

215
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:54,660
 

216
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,888
You're going to get it!

217
00:13:55,888 --> 00:14:09,875
 

218
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,105
- Ash!
- Ash!

219
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:22,288
 

220
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:23,653
Alicia...

221
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:23,756
 

222
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:27,783
Forgive me, chief,
it's my fault.

223
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,627
 

224
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:32,688
It can't be helped.
Maybe this is destiny.

225
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:34,500
 

226
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,229
We leave for Demon Mountain now!

227
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:36,669
 

228
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,137
Nagi, stay with Elliege
and protect the village!

229
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:39,305
 

230
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:41,068
Why!? I'm coming too!

231
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:41,206
 

232
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:44,232
If the village is attacked, Elliege
alone won't be able to handle it!

233
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:44,343
 

234
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:45,571
Please!

235
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:45,978
 

236
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:48,469
I see. Be careful then!

237
00:14:48,469 --> 00:15:14,707
 

238
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:16,937
You are the last girl.

239
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:19,678
 

240
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:22,408
You're not a village girl,
are you?

241
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:22,514
 

242
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:26,245
So what? You'll pay for this,
you buck-toothed pervert!

243
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:29,455
 

244
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:31,650
What a spirited girl...

245
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,525
 

246
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:34,651
Do away with her!

247
00:15:34,651 --> 00:18:03,408
 

248
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:04,466
What's wrong, Asti!?

249
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:04,576
 

250
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:06,100
I hear Tanya's screams.

251
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,347
 

252
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:10,144
- Above us!
- Let's go!

253
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:22,261
 

254
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:23,250
Hey!

255
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:23,729
 

256
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,220
He hasn't changed one bit.

257
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,465
 

258
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:29,798
Asti, next time,
don't use the tomahawk...

259
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:36,608
 

260
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:38,769
Stop! Let go of Tanya!

261
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:38,877
 

262
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:42,335
Don't worry about her.

263
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:42,447
 

264
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:46,645
Now, show me
the sealed emblem.

265
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:53,158
 

266
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:55,092
That's enough, you pervert!

267
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:55,427
 

268
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:56,553
W... what!?

269
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,698
 

270
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:01,689
Now you're all gonna get it!

271
00:19:01,689 --> 00:19:01,900
 

272
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,198
- Ash.
- You again!

273
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:04,303
 

274
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:06,168
Tear them to shreds!!

275
00:19:06,168 --> 00:20:03,228
 

276
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:04,490
Alicia.

277
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,101
 

278
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:10,193
Are you all right?

279
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:10,335
 

280
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,461
Y- yes.

281
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:17,042
 

282
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:19,704
Ash! Buck-toothed pervert
is getting away!

283
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:21,480
 

284
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,606
Wait, you!

285
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:23,715
 

286
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:26,650
Master Briggan! Master Briggan!

287
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,488
 

288
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:32,651
What's with the ruckus, Ed?

289
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:37,262
 

290
00:20:37,262 --> 00:20:42,529
It's terrible, Master Briggan.
Our troops have been annihilated.

291
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:42,668
 

292
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:44,829
- What!?
- There you are!

293
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:45,170
 

294
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,330
It's the Pillar of Light.

295
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:46,805
 

296
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:49,171
Seems like this is their stronghold.

297
00:20:49,171 --> 00:20:50,042
 

298
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,739
It's them! How dare you!!

299
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:53,912
 

300
00:20:53,912 --> 00:20:57,245
Master Briggan is
going to show you now!!

301
00:20:57,245 --> 00:20:57,516
 

302
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:59,746
You must be the leader
of the monsters!

303
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:00,085
 

304
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:05,352
Yes! I am one of the
four lords of darkness, Briggan!

305
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:08,493
 

306
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:10,188
Are you surprised?

307
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:10,562
 

308
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,154
It's just some fat pervert.

309
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:12,264
 

310
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:14,789
- I hate those.
- It's not my taste.

311
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,900
 

312
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,095
The boss of perverts
is a pervert himself.

313
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:17,235
 

314
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:20,693
Hey! Why don't you act
a little scared! That's rude!

315
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:22,174
 

316
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:24,574
Then why don't you make us!

317
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:31,216
 

318
00:21:31,216 --> 00:21:33,241
Foolish humans!

319
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:33,785
 

320
00:21:33,785 --> 00:21:37,482
Graviton Wave!

321
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:51,403
 

322
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:54,031
Are you going to give me
any more lip?

323
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:54,906
 

324
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:57,932
My body won't move.

325
00:21:57,932 --> 00:22:00,512
 

326
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:03,709
How dare you
hurt my dear monsters!

327
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:03,815
 

328
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:05,874
As punishment,
I'm taking your panties!

329
00:22:05,874 --> 00:22:09,020
 

330
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,150
My name is Ed.
Not buck-toothed pervert.

331
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,458
 

332
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,891
One panty!

333
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:16,762
 

334
00:22:16,762 --> 00:22:17,956
Two panties!

335
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:19,398
 

336
00:22:19,398 --> 00:22:20,888
Three panties!

337
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:21,032
 

338
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:24,126
Stop! I'm a guy!

339
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:24,236
 

340
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:27,433
It's ok that you're a guy.

341
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:28,039
 

342
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,233
Stop!

343
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:30,008
 

344
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:31,339
Four panties!

345
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:35,180
 

346
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,741
Ed, make sure you hang them
in the panty collection room.

347
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:38,850
 

348
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,817
Yes, sir.

349
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,019
 

350
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:43,078
Playtime is over.

351
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:46,591
 

352
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:49,788
Offer your flesh and blood
to my sword!

353
00:22:49,788 --> 00:22:49,895
 

354
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:50,987
Wait!

355
00:22:50,987 --> 00:22:51,196
 

356
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:53,289
There're panties over here!

357
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:53,665
 

358
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,996
There you go!

359
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:58,336
 

360
