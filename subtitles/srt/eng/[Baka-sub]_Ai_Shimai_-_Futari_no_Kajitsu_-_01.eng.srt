1
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,014
Taketo! I don't like perverts!

2
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:26,526
We're beyond this, already.

3
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:30,728
You have to wait until
you become a proud and worthy man.

4
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:34,934
Good morning, Mr. Nogawa.

5
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:38,442
Your father is going to hire me
at his company.

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,707
He says he's going to make me
his private secretary.

7
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:45,477
Shall we talk in my office, Yumi?

8
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:48,243
-Why, yes.
-Dad!

9
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:53,446
What's this, Taketo?

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,184
Yumi....

11
00:00:56,261 --> 00:00:58,388
Playing hooky from school
and taking another nap?

12
00:00:58,463 --> 00:01:02,297
-What should we do about you?
-So what? Leave me alone.

13
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,428
As you wish.

14
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:07,096
Are you going out like that?

15
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:09,504
I'm going to work. W-O-R-K, work.

16
00:01:09,574 --> 00:01:13,704
Aren't you embarrassed
about that outfit?

17
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:17,882
Or are you willing to do anything
for my father?

18
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:25,687
You're not man enough
to understand this.

19
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:39,227
That's it.

20
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:43,808
I raised them the same,
but they have different tastes.

21
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:44,772
Oh?

22
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:47,343
Hello?

23
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:55,379
I'm going to make him
recognize me soon enough.

24
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,950
Once I've prepared this bitch,
even better than expected.

25
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,762
Immoral Sisters
~Two Premature Fruits~

26
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,171
The First Night
"Madonna Debauched"

27
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:52,170
Side A:
"Yukie, the Lusty Wife"

28
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:07,419
Hello, this is Kitazawa residence.

29
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:10,287
Hello, dear.

30
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,354
Yes, it's me, Yukie.

31
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:22,105
No, nothing.

32
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,204
I'm a little....

33
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:31,341
...sick.

34
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:47,055
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:50,701
Really.

36
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:53,065
I'm all right.

37
00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:03,842
The girls....

38
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,450
They are fine, too.

39
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:27,836
Tomoko.

40
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:38,780
Nice work, Rumi.

41
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,440
You, too.

42
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,820
-Good work.
-You, too. See you later.

43
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:45,856
-Tomoko.
-Rumi.

44
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:51,124
Tomoko, stop acting
like a scaredy-cat. It's a bad habit.

45
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:53,556
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,859
I have to drop by the Art Club.
Go home on your own.

47
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,569
Ouch!

48
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:08,077
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

49
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:12,608
You look good in pink.

50
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:15,449
You are not hurt, are you?

51
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:32,697
Yes. Don't worry.

52
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:54,188
Yes.

53
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:12,938
No.

54
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:34,523
No, no, you're wrong.
Really, nothing.

55
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:39,166
Nothing. Really.

56
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,968
Yes, of course.

57
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:50,410
I love you, too, dear.

58
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:00,147
¥200,000?

59
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:03,521
No way! The cars barely touched
each other!

60
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:07,793
You can look at our actual estimate.

61
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:15,136
Even if the amount is accurate,
you're partly to blame for the accident.

62
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:19,036
I'll compromise.  You pay 70%
and I'll pay 30%.

63
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,908
Still, you owe us ¥140,000.

64
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:24,879
There is no way I can pay that!

65
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:27,884
Guess we can't settle this
out of court.

66
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:47,296
Please let me go home and...

67
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:50,067
...I'll talk with my husband.

68
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,275
I'm sorry. I'm a little dizzy.

69
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:05,887
Before you go home,
would you at least sign here?

70
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:07,791
What is it?

71
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:10,419
Your agreement to the settlement.

72
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,895
But we haven't settled
the amount....

73
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:18,401
We don't care, but you asked us
to settle it out of court.

74
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:21,669
I'm sorry.

75
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,605
Thank you.

76
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:28,002
Isn't your husband
a section manager at a trading company?

77
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,205
What?

78
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:32,578
¥200,000 in half a year may be
too much for you.

79
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:35,978
What are you talking about?

80
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:39,750
With your looks,
you can make money in so many ways.

81
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:44,823
A life can be so easily changed
with a piece of paper.

82
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:48,357
You don't mean.... Show it to me.

83
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:51,892
What is it?

84
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:01,405
My chest....

85
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,513
I'll make it easy for you, right away.

86
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:07,884
No, no.

87
00:09:26,938 --> 00:09:29,736
All we need now
is to establish the facts.

88
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,208
No!

89
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,909
Don't.

90
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,921
No. Someone help me.

91
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:53,528
Dear.

92
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:58,059
No, no, no, no.

93
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:01,169
I'm sorry, dear.

94
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:05,600
Don't cry.

95
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:08,702
I'll train you.
Soon you'll be making ¥200,000 easily.

96
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,849
Just to show Dad.

97
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,112
I'm home.

98
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:20,490
Mom's out, maybe?

99
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:24,623
She didn't even lock the door.
She is so careless.

100
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:31,259
Tomoko, stop acting like a
scaredy-cat. It's a bad habit.

101
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,239
I don't want to be looked at.
I'm not as pretty as she is.

102
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,400
She has a bad habit, too.

103
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:44,169
I wonder if it feels good.

104
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:59,452
It feels strange.

105
00:12:33,924 --> 00:12:35,016
What was that?

106
00:12:37,995 --> 00:12:39,485
Mother?

107
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:42,195
Mother, are you home?

108
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:49,829
Mother?

109
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,174
Tomoko....

110
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:55,303
What is it?
Has something happened?

111
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,412
-Nothing happened.
-Are you sure?

112
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:05,885
This has nothing to do with you.

113
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:08,214
Mother?

114
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,697
Immoral Sisters

115
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:19,827
Immoral Sisters

116
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:25,707
Ouch.

117
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:27,869
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

118
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:30,739
Tomoko?

119
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:34,548
What's wrong with her?

120
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:40,654
Side B:
Rumi, a Madonna debauched

121
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:47,096
Who could that be?

122
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:53,363
What is this?

123
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:58,166
I'm changing! Get out!

124
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:02,569
-You're Rumi Kitazawa, aren't you?
-What?

125
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:05,046
You'd better not make noise.

126
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:12,450
You wouldn't want to
attract attention.

127
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:22,856
I should introduce myself.

128
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:26,096
I'm Yumi Okamoto, Secretary
to the President of Machikawa Industries.

129
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,161
This has to be fake!

130
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:30,604
Unfortunately....

131
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:39,480
My boss is waiting for you.

132
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:41,810
Would you come with me?

133
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:47,955
You'd better hurry.
My boss is an impatient man.

134
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,890
He'd prefer you just like this.

135
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:07,033
We got a permit to use the rooftop.

136
00:15:07,344 --> 00:15:11,474
Then tell everybody to gather
on the rooftop in half an hour.

137
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:14,340
But none of us are in uniform.

138
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:17,949
We can change on the rooftop.
There won't be anyone to see us.

139
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:20,855
It's part of our duty to get used to
being watched.

140
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:22,892
Really?

141
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:27,494
When you're acting scared,
you will be spotted easily.

142
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:29,696
If they ever see me....

143
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,002
I hear you're something
of a school celebrity.

144
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:38,138
Good grades, athletic, popular,
all-around good student.

145
00:15:39,176 --> 00:15:42,612
All girls' school students
love scandals.

146
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:52,444
I'm too old to be standing under
the winter sky.

147
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:57,321
You shall warm me up
right away.

148
00:16:00,264 --> 00:16:03,893
What are you waiting for?
I'm talking to you, Rumi!

149
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:08,561
I told you.
My boss is an impatient man.

150
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:10,865
I could never do such a thing.

151
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,407
What are you doing?

152
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,506
I'm attaching your
mother's photo to e-mails....

153
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:21,478
Please don't....

154
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:24,077
You're asking the wrong person.

155
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:26,987
More than anything,
I hate to be made to wait!

156
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:29,287
What do you want me to do?

157
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,423
How could you not know? You're old
enough to have heard all about it.

158
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,476
Idiot.

159
00:16:50,648 --> 00:16:53,276
Don't hit me! I'll do as you say!

160
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:58,353
-I'll even do fellatio.
-You mean, you want to suck?

161
00:16:58,822 --> 00:17:00,585
I want to suck.

162
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:06,023
This time, use your tongue right.

163
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:11,332
Yumi, send out the e-mail!

164
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:12,799
Wait!

165
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:51,167
Looks like she's quite a good student
in this subject as well.

166
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:53,900
I agree.

167
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:57,013
Though she's not innocent
like you were once.

168
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:04,115
Good morning, boss.

169
00:18:05,656 --> 00:18:08,454
Your father is going to
hire me at his company.

170
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:11,619
He says he's going to make me his
private secretary.

171
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:16,595
Shall we talk in my office, Yumi?

172
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,157
Why, yes.

173
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:27,374
It's been a while since I last
visited you.

174
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:29,636
I can cook something.

175
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,308
I've become quite good at cooking.

176
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:38,945
By the way, Uncle, please talk to
Taketo. He's acting like....

177
00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:44,188
Good thing you've graduated
from those childish ones.

178
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,561
What are you doing?

179
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,565
Is it trendy to wear
these sexy ones?

180
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,464
Please don't.

181
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:53,526
You're not stupid.

182
00:18:54,171 --> 00:18:56,366
You lost your parents early...

183
00:18:56,607 --> 00:19:00,907
...and had no one else
to take care of you.

184
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:05,347
You knew I was not
acting out of charity.

185
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:09,782
What's with you bringing me here,
all of the sudden?

186
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:15,220
You must have been joking, earlier.
For a moment, I thought you meant it.

187
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,692
You are my uncle. For you to say....

188
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:20,423
Enough talking!
Remove your hands!

189
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:23,125
What? I don't want you to see....

190
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,665
I'm telling you to show me!

191
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:29,399
This is your job interview!
Spread your legs!

192
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:35,845
Raise your knees!

193
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,644
No. No.

194
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:42,244
Remember how you sat down to
pee, when you were a child?

195
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,411
Take that pose!

196
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:56,564
My son seems to like this.

197
00:19:57,701 --> 00:20:00,636
I prefer this.

198
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:07,543
If you are not a virgin,
your application will be rejected.

199
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:12,982
No.

200
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:15,649
Don't.

201
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:20,184
No!

202
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:26,786
Please stop.

203
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:31,430
No, no, no.

204
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,342
No, no. Stop.

205
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,308
No.

206
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:51,152
No, no!

207
00:21:31,628 --> 00:21:33,391
Swallow it all.

208
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:39,835
When you are done with sucking...

209
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:43,634
...the polite thing to do is to
masturbate for him.

210
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:50,738
Not my back.

211
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:54,875
You're such a slut,
you have to do this every day.

212
00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:57,186
Please, forgive me.

213
00:21:58,355 --> 00:22:00,016
How do you do it?

214
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:02,517
I'll do it right away.

215
00:22:06,496 --> 00:22:09,727
Like this. With my panties on.

216
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,100
You like panties, don't you?

217
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,861
It feels like I'm being watched.

218
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:20,501
I think about how they watch me
in the club activities, and it's so good.

219
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:25,507
No, not my ass. No.

220
00:22:29,252 --> 00:22:30,810
What a surprise.

221
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:33,481
What a slut.

222
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:36,820
She's already cum once,
but look at this.

223
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:15,451
Your panties are already drenched.

224
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:19,786
Now....

225
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,223
No, not there....

226
00:25:01,171 --> 00:25:02,661
It hurts.

227
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,738
No.

228
00:25:08,478 --> 00:25:09,809
Stop.

229
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,009
It hurts, it hurts.

230
00:25:40,644 --> 00:25:44,341
Oops. Your precious panties are
covered with blood.

231
00:25:44,748 --> 00:25:48,548
Listen, Rumi. You go home
wearing this.

232
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:52,552
Wow. Our rooftop is quite large.

233
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:54,687
Oh, no. Are we changing here?

234
00:25:54,758 --> 00:25:57,249
Stupid! We should have changed
before we came up here.

235
00:25:57,594 --> 00:26:00,324
What if
someone was peeking at us?

236
00:26:00,897 --> 00:26:05,163
Look, change if you haven't already!
We're starting.

237
00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:09,433
I enjoy thinking about
which pair of panties to put on.

238
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:13,636
Today we're cheering the tennis
players, so mine look like tennis balls.

239
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:18,170
-Nana's panties are slutty.
-Don't be ridiculous!

240
00:26:18,248 --> 00:26:21,046
Nana color-coordinates her panties
for girl she's cheering.

241
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:22,379
I know!

242
00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:26,115
Nana only wears this color
when she's cheering the tennis players.

243
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:30,990
Our tennis player Rumi Kitazawa
wears that color.

244
00:26:31,394 --> 00:26:34,830
How do you know
Rumi's taste in panties?

245
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:37,799
I'm always watching
the tennis club practice.

246
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:40,800
Well soon, Rumi's taste in
panties will be red, right?
