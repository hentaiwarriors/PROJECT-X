1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is a free, fan-created translation. If you have paid money for this release, you are an idiot.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This fansub is dedicated to Osamu Tezuka, Mushi Productions, and all the early pioneers of anime.

3
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:18,773
Subtitles by Animerama Archival Society

4
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:31,549
Cleopatra

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
-=Fansubber's Notes=-

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Though this film was subtitled and released in the US in the early 70s,

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No copies of that version are known to exist.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
After extensive searching, the only translation to be found is a subtitle track on a Chinese bootleg DVD.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This appears to be a machine- translation from the Chinese version,

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Which itself may have been a machine-translation from Japanese.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The result, as you would expect, is unintelligible gibberish.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This translation has been made with no knowledge of either the Japanese or Chinese languages.

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Instead, the Engrish subtitles from the Chinese DVD have been used as a guide,

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Along with multiple viewings, both with and without subtitles,

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
To create a plausible translation.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
As such, this is not a word-accurate translation by any standard.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Though it is probably closer to the original than, for instance, the English dub of Voltron.

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Every attempt has been made to convey the original story as we assume it was intended.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Though some artistic liberties have been taken to ensure the story makes some sort of fucking sense.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
As much sense as is possible, considering the original content.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Frankly, this film is pretty much batshit-crazy in any language.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Enjoy the show.

23
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:35,808
Am I late?

24
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:38,718
No, you're just in time, Mary.

25
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:39,167
Lets go.

26
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:42,596
What do you plan to do?

27
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:44,537
You'll see what I intend to do.

28
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:57,214
The real Mary arrived five minutes ago.

29
00:04:57,946 --> 00:05:00,062
Please sit and enjoy your meal.

30
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:04,991
We have prepared the best French food and champagne.

31
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:15,103
Caviar, Egg Crepes, Escargot

32
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:19,148
The Champagne is a 1559 from the Dulan district of Tuer.

33
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:21,313
A toast to good luck.

34
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,826
Please let me explain

35
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,307
about the «imposter» Mary.

36
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:35,208
She was a spy for the Pasateli.

37
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:37,084
I should have known.

38
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:38,373
Pasateli?

39
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,084
Is that the star system the Long March troops want to seize?

40
00:05:42,323 --> 00:05:45,736
The Pasateli are the original residents of that star system.

41
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:51,485
They don't welcome visitors from Earth.  In fact they hate Earthlings.

42
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:54,839
We delayed our project because of this.

43
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:58,781
The mantra of the Pasateli is

44
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:01,272
«Dekesu manto»

45
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:05,507
In earth language, it translates to «Cleopatra plan»

46
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,942
Cleopatra plan?

47
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:10,457
Yes, it doesn't make sense to me either.

48
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:13,972
What does their scheme have to do with Cleopatra?

49
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:18,017
To solve this riddle,

50
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:21,329
we have to go to the time of Cleopatra to investigate.

51
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:23,987
We have to go back in time in that machine?

52
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:26,826
This is a very strange plan.

53
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:28,969
Is your machine reliable?

54
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:30,638
Very reliable.
It is the latest technology.

55
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:36,801
It can be used to send a person to the past or the future.

56
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:40,114
But we do not send the body.

57
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:43,283
Instead we send the spirit into someone in the past.

58
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,662
It is much safer this way.

59
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:52,374
We could be sent into the body of Kennedy or Napoleon?

60
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,194
Or Beethoven or Rasputin?

61
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:00,806
Will we be able to come back?

62
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:03,003
Yes, maybe.

63
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:09,617
The machine has only just been completed.  It is still being tested.

64
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:14,064
If it brakes, you may not be able to come back.

65
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:17,187
Whose body will I be sent into?

66
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:18,768
Gucilang

67
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:22,176
You are slave of Julius Caesar

68
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,823
Oh, a slave?

69
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:26,993
Hahaha! That is very suitable.

70
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:28,076
Mary will be a pharaoh.

71
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:31,260
You will go into body of a princess of Egypt.

72
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:35,718
Haluwei, you will be Luba

73
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:37,436
Luba?  Who is he?

74
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:44,469
He is, um... very close to Cleopatra.

75
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:45,839
Close to Cleopatra?

76
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:50,412
Wonderful!  Close enough to get some action I wonder?

77
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:53,861
You can bring us both drinks.

78
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:59,823
I hope you will you will enjoy being our slave.

79
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:10,722
Wait, I am not ready to go!

80
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:27,725
If this works properly, it is just your soul that will go.

81
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:46,565
If your spirit doesn't arrive there, you will certainly die.

82
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:51,749
But with good luck, you will survive the trip.

83
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:54,217
Oh, this really is like gambling.

84
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:58,221
You can be brought back if you don't die.

85
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,921
Well then, I will await your return.  Good Luck.

86
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:44,217
We the emissaries of Alexandria

87
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:49,996
Long live Caesar, grand general and emperor of Rome!

88
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,148
Wait! That is my daughter!

89
00:12:59,627 --> 00:13:03,620
What good luck! I have finally found a girl who interests me.

90
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:10,520
Caesar...

91
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:33,664
Bo..Bo..Botinis

92
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:36,143
Give me some wine.

93
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:42,051
King Fudolaim, please calm down.

94
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:46,702
Caesar will pay you a visit soon.

95
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,735
I know.

96
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,731
Caesar has arrived!

97
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:11,533
I am here to inspect these lands.

98
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,621
He's finished.

99
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:15,481
Who are you?

100
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:21,643
I am, I am the king!

101
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:22,876
King?

102
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:26,414
King.

103
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:27,434
I am Caesar.

104
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:29,788
From now on, I will be staying here.

105
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:34,109
I'm sorry if I have frightened you.

106
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,634
This town now belongs to me.

107
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:42,332
This girl will be my translator to communicate with the locals.

108
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,521
I expect you to show her respect.

109
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:46,512
What's that noise?

110
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:48,624
Aiduo, do you hear it?

111
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:49,994
Troops have come!

112
00:14:50,371 --> 00:14:51,292
Well done.

113
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:54,596
Please forgive me.

114
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:59,947
I am used to getting my way.
Do you understand?

115
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:01,928
Thank you.

116
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:05,371
Tell the leader...

117
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:07,464
Miss,

118
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:09,954
Tell your father,

119
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:13,315
It is important to follow Caesar

120
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:15,998
Those who oppose me shall die.

121
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:19,966
Send out my proclamation!
Do you hear me?

122
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:22,555
What is it?

123
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,942
Caesar is only a man.

124
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:29,470
And as the saying goes, «Brawn will fall to beauty.»

125
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:32,680
Now we can use beauty to kill him.

126
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:33,593
No

127
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:34,222
What?

128
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:37,000
No woman is strong enough.

129
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:39,533
Caesar is too tough to die.

130
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,558
Then we will use a woman who will soften him up with sex.

131
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:43,461
Caesar will never fall for it.

132
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:44,472
Then use a virgin.

133
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:45,406
I'll do it.

134
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:46,432
Libia!

135
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,183
You will die.

136
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,919
Heng, don't be silly.

137
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:57,675
Caesar won't love your daughter.

138
00:15:57,872 --> 00:15:58,998
Apollo Duolia!

139
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,446
If I try my best...

140
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:03,383
A great mind is not enough.
Use your head!

141
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:06,259
You are no good for the task.

142
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:07,394
Why?

143
00:16:07,915 --> 00:16:12,386
Caesar is a powerful man,

144
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:19,082
So it is not easy for him to love a common woman.

145
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,886
You should use a famous prostitute with much skill.

146
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:25,582
A flawless body and the face of an angel.

147
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:29,182
She must be someone special.

148
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,961
Where will we find someone like that?

149
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:33,158
I already have.

150
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,398
Then let's see

151
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:38,281
She is on the other side of this door.

152
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:39,929
Who is she?

153
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:41,643
Cleopatra.

154
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:43,415
Cleopatra?

155
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:47,621
Cleopatra, come in here.

156
00:16:57,362 --> 00:16:58,345
I know this woman!

157
00:16:58,832 --> 00:16:59,890
She is the sister of King Fudolaim.

158
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:04,293
Yes, her brother is the king.
What does he want her to do?

159
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:05,426
Sleep with us!

160
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:09,992
I have no respect for my brother.

161
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:14,198
I hate any man who yields to Caesar.

162
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:18,149
As long as Egypt is occupied by invaders,

163
00:17:19,153 --> 00:17:21,849
it is every person's duty to resist.

164
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:25,529
I swear my life for this country!

165
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,817
Don't just talk,

166
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:28,523
do something.

167
00:17:35,202 --> 00:17:38,376
Let me show you the strength of an angry cunt.

168
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:41,152
Here, I will show you.

169
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:42,930
What?

170
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:45,693
Forgive me!

171
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,819
Cleopatra,

172
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:06,966
do you think you can beat Caesar

173
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:09,656
ten times before the moon rises,

174
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:12,158
and ten times after?

175
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:13,397
Severe?

176
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:15,650
Don't you feel sorry for Caesar?

177
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:16,557
You're crazy.

178
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:17,898
What are you saying?

179
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:18,927
Her face...

180
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:19,722
Asshole!

181
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:22,858
Cleopatra is the best in the world!

182
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,632
And she will be beautiful after tonight.

183
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:28,430
Look out!

184
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:30,288
The Romans are here.

185
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:31,037
We've been found out.

186
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:34,964
Go through the cave.  Quickly.

187
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:10,043
Libia

188
00:19:10,764 --> 00:19:12,607
Please convey the message,

189
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:14,912
the resistance troops have all been killed.

190
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:16,671
It is up to Cleopatra now.

191
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:17,475
Yes.

192
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:21,696
Mary Fuailuo,

193
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:27,322
You will go into a princess of Egypt.

194
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:32,138
Apollo Duolia?

195
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:35,027
What is it Cleopatra?

196
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:37,877
Can a face really be changed?

197
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:39,811
I am worried.

198
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:44,925
It can be changed if a woman truly has the will, and some magical assistance.

199
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:51,316
Your beauty will go down in history.

200
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:57,922
For Egypt, you must make up your mind Cleopatra.

201
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:02,314
Apollo Duolia will always be with you.

202
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:06,318
I will give you strength.

203
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,632
Stop, it tickles.

204
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:12,806
What is that?

205
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:15,561
The base of a temple.

206
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:18,503
We're headed the right way.

207
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,794
Look, it's Luba.

208
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:34,085
We will be arriving soon.

209
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:36,564
Luba will guide us from here.

210
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:38,227
Luba

211
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:39,912
Show us the way.

212
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:49,075
There.

213
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,080
There is someone here who knows the magic we need.

214
00:20:57,905 --> 00:20:59,372
Who has come?

215
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:02,061
Are you prepared?

216
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:07,103
Why are you shivering?

217
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:10,723
Oh, it will not be painful.
Not Painful.

218
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:18,286
This body-changing procedure is over five thousand years old.

219
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:20,953
What shall we change your face into?

220
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:22,142
Hey you!  Scram!

221
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:23,482
The dead should not inconvenience the living.

222
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:36,776
Just lay down here please and we will get started.

223
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:41,430
Hmmm, which face should I choose?

224
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:47,923
If your nose was just a little higher, it could change history.

225
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:49,855
OK then,

226
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:55,730
Lets do it.

227
00:21:56,396 --> 00:22:05,543
We need to make your skin soft and smooth.

228
00:22:06,406 --> 00:22:08,931
Drink this.

229
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:15,791
It won't taste good, but beauty is never easy.

230
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:24,398
Drink it down in one gulp.

231
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,287
Perfect, now the real work begins.

232
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:03,417
Make the breasts large and womanly.  Just like my mother's.

233
00:23:03,797 --> 00:23:10,248
A slim waist and wide hips.

234
00:23:12,406 --> 00:23:15,546
The legs look pretty good already.

235
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:43,137
She's so beautiful!

236
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:48,996
Cleopatra, with that face you will conquer the world!

237
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,076
I am only how you have made me.

238
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:53,801
All natural flowers eventually fade away.

239
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:57,038
But your artificial beauty will endure forever.

240
00:23:57,617 --> 00:24:00,245
Luba, how do I look?

241
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:03,310
You don't like it?

242
00:24:03,824 --> 00:24:04,677
Please be honest with me.

243
00:24:07,294 --> 00:24:11,663
Haluwei, you will be someone close to Cleopatra.

244
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,011
Luba.  Luba.

245
00:24:19,072 --> 00:24:20,232
Bad cat!

246
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:25,563
Cleopatra, you must prepare yourself.

247
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:35,716
Maybe it is a little too narrow...

248
00:26:07,547 --> 00:26:08,434
Is it uncomfortable?

249
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:10,212
A little bit.

250
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:11,170
Deal with it.

251
00:26:11,418 --> 00:26:12,510
Easy for you to say!

252
00:26:40,547 --> 00:26:43,584
Old woman, this is the House of Caesar.  State your
business.

253
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:46,778
I have come to bring clothes for Caesar.

254
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:48,313
OK, give them to me.

255
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:50,804
No, I must deliver them in person.

256
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:52,113
I said give them to me!

257
00:26:52,726 --> 00:26:54,159
Ali, what is the problem?

258
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:55,848
Bring it here.

259
00:26:57,864 --> 00:26:59,434
I feel you are not who you seem.

260
00:27:03,837 --> 00:27:10,015
I despise dirty clothes.  They must be washed immediately.

261
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:15,994
Luckily I already have the cauldron boiling for washing.

262
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:19,404
Throw them in.

263
00:27:21,621 --> 00:27:22,883
Put the clothes in to wash and then you may leave.

264
00:27:23,757 --> 00:27:24,337
What is the matter?

265
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:27,013
They are my clothes, so I may wash them if I wish.

266
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:37,458
What's wrong,

267
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:38,762
Apollo Duolia?

268
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:42,264
You are very predictable.

269
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:47,237
Whatever your plan, it will never succeed.

270
00:27:47,614 --> 00:27:49,423
Enough already.  Put it there.

271
00:27:50,383 --> 00:27:54,581
I know you and Cleopatra have sworn to fight the Roman occupation.

272
00:27:54,888 --> 00:27:56,014
I know everything.

273
00:27:57,257 --> 00:28:00,363
Speaking of Cleopatra, how is she these days?

274
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:05,489
I came to Egypt knowing my presence would anger her.

275
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:06,748
What do you think of the situation?

276
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:10,568
The little king is weak,

277
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:13,932
And Cleopatra has openly defied her brother.

278
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,133
These are all interesting events.

279
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,304
I will deal with these clothes later.

280
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:19,458
You may leave.

281
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:23,174
Do not trouble me again.

282
00:28:34,027 --> 00:28:38,327
Now I am bored.

283
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:42,821
The smell of a woman,

284
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,744
comes from such a small bag.

285
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:05,091
Sweet zombie jesus!

286
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:09,518
Is that Cleopatra?

287
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:15,930
You are more beautiful than I imagined.

288
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:19,333
I have been hoping we would meet.

289
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:22,371
What will you do with me?

290
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:28,343
Most people think I am simply a tool of the Roman military.

291
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:29,502
But the fact it

292
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:32,274
I am not simply a general or a conqueror.

293
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:36,507
I am only a man who needs something beautiful.

294
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:39,313
Egypt is beautiful...

295
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:40,776
You should visit Rome

296
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:44,147
You would see things far more beautiful than Egypt

297
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:50,680
But they cannot compete with you.

298
00:29:51,805 --> 00:29:54,603
Any city without Cleopatra is a slum.

299
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,308
Then Rome is a slum.

300
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,350
To fight with someone so beautiful

301
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:01,378
I don't have the strength.

302
00:30:02,482 --> 00:30:03,198
Cleopatra,

303
00:30:04,384 --> 00:30:06,875
I don't want to fight with you.

304
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:12,185
You make me horny as hell when I see you.

305
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:13,412
I am too old for this.

306
00:30:13,693 --> 00:30:18,062
Caesar is Rome's greatest general.

307
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:22,075
You can have any woman you desire.

308
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:27,333
How can I believe someone like you?

309
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:33,478
Caesar, May I ask you a question?

310
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:36,790
Are you really just a man?

311
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:40,762
Certainly I am only human, and a human who has been conquered by love.

312
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:43,381
Let me prove it to you.

313
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:48,323
You have lost your mind.

314
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:55,325
Only the brightest light from a diamond can blind you.

315
00:30:56,503 --> 00:30:59,438
Nothing else can be compared to that.

316
00:31:00,874 --> 00:31:01,454
One thing can.

317
00:31:02,675 --> 00:31:04,449
I am searching for something better than diamonds.

318
00:31:05,545 --> 00:31:06,978
What is it?

319
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:08,833
You, the jewel of Egypt.

320
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:51,010
How is the princess?

321
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:53,005
It seems she is addressing an important speech.

322
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:54,603
Did she kill Caesar?

323
00:33:58,284 --> 00:33:58,796
It's Caesar

324
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:00,635
He still lives.

325
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,823
I believe

326
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,163
Egypt is the most beautiful land the gods ever created.

327
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:15,179
I have been thinking about my past failures.

328
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:17,635
This country does not belong to Rome.

329
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:21,301
Egypt should belong to the people of Egypt!

330
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:29,727
Caesar really is wonderful.
I'm his biggest fan!

331
00:34:30,283 --> 00:34:32,604
That throne is Caesar's

332
00:34:32,986 --> 00:34:35,887
And the one beside it is for me.

333
00:34:41,527 --> 00:34:44,394
I would like to introduce the new ruler of Egypt:

334
00:34:45,331 --> 00:34:46,662
Queen Cleopatra

335
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,893
For the people of Egypt, an Egyptian queen.

336
00:34:53,272 --> 00:34:53,852
Cleopatra

337
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:10,376
Caesar

338
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,328
Caesar controls all of Egypt.

339
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:14,292
Cleopatra has betrayed us.

340
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:14,936
Yes.

341
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:18,485
Look, Apollo Duolia is with them.

342
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:21,038
Why does she have that mischievous look on her face?

343
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:24,427
Can we trust her?

344
00:35:24,837 --> 00:35:25,963
Yes.

345
00:35:26,372 --> 00:35:27,259
Think about it.

346
00:35:28,207 --> 00:35:29,299
She must have a clever plan.

347
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:44,407
Pour that poison into the water.

348
00:35:45,324 --> 00:35:49,351
Anyone who gets his water from the river, like Caesar,

349
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:53,933
Will be in for a nasty surprise!

350
00:35:56,202 --> 00:35:57,021
Will they die?

351
00:35:57,236 --> 00:36:01,400
Well, they might shit themselves to death.

352
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:03,689
Then Egypt will be liberated.

353
00:36:23,863 --> 00:36:24,306
Someone is in here.

354
00:36:24,597 --> 00:36:25,382
Just a minute.

355
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:26,245
Occupied.

356
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:29,559
Someone is in here.

357
00:36:32,905 --> 00:36:33,587
Open up for Caesar!

358
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,761
Go away.

359
00:36:36,242 --> 00:36:36,617
You highness,

360
00:36:37,176 --> 00:36:37,892
I have a report.

361
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:40,750
Whisper it to me.

362
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,769
Our warships are under attack.

363
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:44,997
What?!

364
00:37:13,312 --> 00:37:13,926
Mary...

365
00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:25,073
Are you awake?

366
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:27,954
Please wake up.

367
00:37:30,863 --> 00:37:31,409
Mary?

368
00:37:32,098 --> 00:37:33,156
I am not Mary.

369
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:34,915
I am Libia.

370
00:37:43,509 --> 00:37:44,089
You are a slave?

371
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:44,851
Yes.

372
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:46,020
Roman?

373
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:46,820
Yes.

374
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:49,785
I escaped from one of Caesar's warships.

375
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:51,542
The battle continues.

376
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:54,083
You are lucky to have escaped.

377
00:37:56,956 --> 00:37:57,809
You should lie down.

378
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:00,850
Poor thing.

379
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:09,466
Why have you come to me?

380
00:38:10,002 --> 00:38:11,264
It must have been fate.

381
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:12,353
It wasn't.

382
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,136
I don't believe in fate.

383
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,627
Where do you live?

384
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:19,598
I was born and raised right here.

385
00:38:20,346 --> 00:38:23,930
Perhaps you were here before you were born.

386
00:38:24,717 --> 00:38:25,604
Before birth?

387
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:32,231
There is an old saying« »Before the birth of the body, there was the spirit»

388
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,940
Libia

389
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:35,936
Yes?

390
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:37,655
It is nice to meet you.

391
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:41,215
What do you plan to do next?

392
00:38:42,301 --> 00:38:42,608
Escape.

393
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:44,846
Soldiers!

394
00:38:56,215 --> 00:38:56,795
It's up to you.

395
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:12,939
Once more, in slow motion.

396
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:44,164
Are you one of Caesar's spies?

397
00:40:45,424 --> 00:40:46,482
No.

398
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:49,654
Then why did you break into my camp?

399
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,612
I have no idea.

400
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:55,634
I'll give you one more chance!

401
00:40:58,637 --> 00:41:00,753
I am just a slave.

402
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,415
Bullshit!

403
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:08,662
If you will not tell the truth, we will punish your girlfriend.

404
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:11,299
How do you like that?

405
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,116
Three minutes each,

406
00:41:19,692 --> 00:41:20,989
Until she is split two!

407
00:41:23,796 --> 00:41:25,741
I am strong.

408
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:28,653
It will take more than a few hundred men to break me.

409
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:30,111
Wait a minute.

410
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:33,368
Is that medicine?

411
00:41:33,873 --> 00:41:34,862
What if it is?

412
00:41:35,474 --> 00:41:37,829
I think I can help you out.

413
00:41:38,577 --> 00:41:39,635
Let the woman go.

414
00:41:39,912 --> 00:41:40,833
That's not fair!

415
00:41:41,013 --> 00:41:41,388
Shut up!

416
00:41:42,348 --> 00:41:43,030
Go away.

417
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:48,194
We've been waiting for this!
What am I supposed to do
with these blue balls?

418
00:41:50,423 --> 00:41:51,037
Out with it.

419
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:56,203
I am a chemist for Caesar.

420
00:41:57,763 --> 00:41:59,606
I can make a poison for you.

421
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:06,974
What sort of poison can you make?
Tell me what it can do.

422
00:42:08,274 --> 00:42:10,390
Poison that can turn a man to dust.

423
00:42:10,776 --> 00:42:11,356
Liar!

424
00:42:12,912 --> 00:42:14,925
Whether you believe it or not, it is true.

425
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:19,049
OK, do it.

426
00:42:20,152 --> 00:42:22,814
Give me access to those jars and I will make it right now.

427
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,475
If you cannot do as you claim, I will kill you.

428
00:42:32,264 --> 00:42:33,424
Can you really make it?

429
00:42:36,602 --> 00:42:37,284
I have no idea.

430
00:42:37,803 --> 00:42:38,929
Nice plan.

431
00:42:40,306 --> 00:42:43,719
I don't know why, but I have a feeling I can do this.

432
00:42:45,578 --> 00:42:50,083
But something in my heart tells me I can do this.

433
00:42:52,618 --> 00:42:53,539
I hope this works.

434
00:42:56,222 --> 00:42:56,529
Is it done?

435
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,057
Just a minute.
I am almost finished.

436
00:43:05,731 --> 00:43:06,652
What is that?

437
00:43:08,033 --> 00:43:08,408
The torch.

438
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:09,442
OK

439
00:43:09,768 --> 00:43:10,757
It is ready?

440
00:43:11,203 --> 00:43:12,022
Make the woman drink it.

441
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:14,770
If she doesn't, I'll make you both drink.

442
00:43:14,907 --> 00:43:16,716
No, this is not for drinking.

443
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,295
Then how does it work?

444
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:19,487
Like this!

445
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:29,552
Is it magic?

446
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:32,696
I will kill you!

447
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:44,430
I don't think I'll make a very good ghost.

448
00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:47,165
Botinis!

449
00:43:48,507 --> 00:43:50,077
You are...

450
00:43:54,413 --> 00:43:56,017
You are some kind of demon!

451
00:43:56,782 --> 00:43:58,898
Kill him!

452
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,077
King Fudolaim has drowned.

453
00:44:51,537 --> 00:44:52,561
Why is that a problem?

454
00:44:53,038 --> 00:44:53,891
I don't know.

455
00:44:54,173 --> 00:44:56,391
We found these two in the remains of his camp.

456
00:44:56,942 --> 00:44:58,682
He looks like one of our slaves.

457
00:44:59,478 --> 00:45:00,740
What were you doing there?

458
00:45:01,413 --> 00:45:02,812
How did Fudolaim die?

459
00:45:03,082 --> 00:45:04,549
He was killed by an army.

460
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:05,362
Shut your mouth!

461
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:06,164
Lying whore!

462
00:45:06,585 --> 00:45:08,359
The man is a fine physical specimen.

463
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:10,519
I think I'll let him live.

464
00:45:11,523 --> 00:45:14,765
Officers, check the record of runaway slaves.

465
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:17,270
If he is a slave, I have something better in mind for him.

466
00:45:17,596 --> 00:45:18,654
What should we do with the woman?

467
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:22,827
She's a sweet piece of ass.

468
00:45:25,371 --> 00:45:26,262
Does this piece of ass belong to you?

469
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,719
It appears so.

470
00:45:28,407 --> 00:45:30,216
Well, now it belongs to me.

471
00:45:32,845 --> 00:45:33,527
Move out!

472
00:45:33,879 --> 00:45:34,288
Yes Sir!

473
00:45:37,449 --> 00:45:39,872
Now is the perfect time.

474
00:45:40,419 --> 00:45:46,665
Caesar loves you.  You must get him to drink this.

475
00:45:46,792 --> 00:45:51,570
Even he is made of iron, it will kill him within 3 seconds.

476
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:57,054
You are shivering, Cleopatra.

477
00:45:57,236 --> 00:45:59,864
How can you be so weak?

478
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:02,701
You must be both strong and courageous for your country.

479
00:46:03,142 --> 00:46:06,009
Apollo Duolia will make you strong.

480
00:46:16,722 --> 00:46:17,814
Has Caesar returned?

481
00:46:35,407 --> 00:46:36,567
Caesar!

482
00:46:42,114 --> 00:46:44,435
I have been waiting for you to come back.

483
00:46:44,616 --> 00:46:47,414
I worry every time you leave that I will never see you again.

484
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:48,932
My travels leave me tired and sore.

485
00:46:49,788 --> 00:46:50,402
I want to have a bath.

486
00:46:50,689 --> 00:46:51,747
How about a steam bath?

487
00:46:51,924 --> 00:46:53,869
A steam bath, Roman style.

488
00:47:51,683 --> 00:47:53,048
Oh Caesar!

489
00:47:53,952 --> 00:47:56,887
Oh Caesar!  No!  Don't do that!

490
00:47:58,757 --> 00:48:01,043
No Caesar

491
00:48:07,032 --> 00:48:10,342
We can't do that here.
Someone might see us.

492
00:48:10,736 --> 00:48:12,067
I'm begging you to stop.

493
00:49:48,901 --> 00:49:49,413
Caesar!

494
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:57,952
Water!  Give me water!

495
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:01,847
Quickly, water water.

496
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:22,549
I'm saved.

497
00:50:25,504 --> 00:50:27,825
His condition is the result of an illness he has had since he was very young.

498
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,392
It comes and goes from time to time.

499
00:50:30,742 --> 00:50:35,350
The symptoms are varied and sometimes bizarre.

500
00:50:35,681 --> 00:50:42,644
If a nerve is pinched the wrong way, he can have a severe reaction.

501
00:50:42,821 --> 00:50:43,674
That is to say,

502
00:50:44,122 --> 00:50:47,023
it could come on at any time without warning.

503
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,821
Caesar will likely spend his whole life with these problems.

504
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:52,658
Is there any cure?

505
00:50:52,998 --> 00:50:55,558
The cure is to drink poison.

506
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:57,952
A strong poison for a strong disease.

507
00:50:58,103 --> 00:51:02,028
For a man with this condition, poison is medicine.

508
00:51:26,531 --> 00:51:27,008
Get away from me!

509
00:51:38,377 --> 00:51:39,571
Oh, you were trying to help me.

510
00:51:40,846 --> 00:51:42,177
You want me to escape?

511
00:51:44,383 --> 00:51:46,840
Thank you.  I will give you a reward.

512
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,980
Bye bye, lovely little leopard.

513
00:51:52,591 --> 00:51:53,512
I need some lemon.

514
00:51:55,327 --> 00:51:57,579
Bring me a lemon, quickly!

515
00:51:59,398 --> 00:52:00,660
Lemons for her highness.

516
00:52:00,832 --> 00:52:01,309
Put it there.

517
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:04,028
Leave the room!  All of you!

518
00:52:07,339 --> 00:52:10,172
Am I knocked up with Caesar's Child?

519
00:52:11,043 --> 00:52:11,828
What should I do?

520
00:52:13,445 --> 00:52:14,469
Give birth to Caesar's heir?

521
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,267
Or end it?

522
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,154
OK, stop now.

523
00:52:34,066 --> 00:52:35,772
I find your skill very interesting.

524
00:52:36,101 --> 00:52:36,578
Yaonius,

525
00:52:37,369 --> 00:52:40,441
Be my warrior and fight for me.

526
00:52:41,073 --> 00:52:41,960
And win.

527
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:43,716
What?

528
00:52:44,342 --> 00:52:46,492
That gladiator made this.

529
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:52,134
How does it work?

530
00:52:54,586 --> 00:52:55,371
Well, Yaonius?

531
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:58,052
I've never seen this before.

532
00:52:59,191 --> 00:53:00,453
I don't know how to use it.

533
00:53:01,993 --> 00:53:03,836
There is something suspicious about that man.

534
00:53:04,129 --> 00:53:04,777
Don't be a dick.

535
00:53:05,497 --> 00:53:06,930
Give it a try.

536
00:53:07,566 --> 00:53:08,078
That's an order.

537
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:09,010
Try it.

538
00:53:10,435 --> 00:53:10,981
What is the problem?

539
00:53:11,636 --> 00:53:12,796
Hurry up.

540
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:15,355
My apologies,

541
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:17,067
it's Cleopatra.

542
00:53:17,742 --> 00:53:18,663
What is wrong with Cleopatra?

543
00:53:19,144 --> 00:53:21,977
She has given birth to a son.

544
00:53:28,787 --> 00:53:29,503
Apollo Duolia.

545
00:53:30,722 --> 00:53:31,780
Caesar is coming.

546
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:32,799
Yes.

547
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:33,671
Use this.

548
00:53:34,426 --> 00:53:35,245
Must I kill him now?

549
00:53:35,794 --> 00:53:38,388
This is the best time to kill Caesar.

550
00:53:38,964 --> 00:53:39,885
No, I can't do it.

551
00:53:40,165 --> 00:53:41,427
This is for your country!

552
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,453
Have you forgotten your mission?

553
00:53:43,802 --> 00:53:46,600
If you do not succeed, we will all fail.

554
00:53:47,906 --> 00:53:49,203
OK, keep that in mind.

555
00:53:54,312 --> 00:53:54,755
Wait here.

556
00:54:01,419 --> 00:54:02,374
You look thinner than the last time I saw you.

557
00:54:03,488 --> 00:54:04,921
And you seem to be in a good mood.

558
00:54:05,857 --> 00:54:07,393
Dad, meet your son.

559
00:54:09,227 --> 00:54:10,251
He looks like you.

560
00:54:10,762 --> 00:54:12,366
Pick him up.

561
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:13,211
I shouldn't.

562
00:54:13,398 --> 00:54:15,855
Of course you should!
You are his father.

563
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:18,965
Well if I must, then I must.

564
00:54:20,805 --> 00:54:21,863
Good boy!  Good boy!

565
00:54:27,412 --> 00:54:29,801
Cleopatra, my child is looking at me!

566
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:31,905
You never know how beautiful a child is until you are a father.

567
00:54:32,484 --> 00:54:33,815
This child is perfect.

568
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:36,430
Son, you will go on a tour soon.

569
00:54:36,788 --> 00:54:38,801
You will go with your mother to Rome.

570
00:54:39,157 --> 00:54:40,658
To Rome?

571
00:54:41,026 --> 00:54:42,357
Yes, to Rome.

572
00:54:45,397 --> 00:54:46,967
Oh, I've just thought of the perfect name.

573
00:54:47,399 --> 00:54:48,491
How about Leo Caesar

574
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:50,361
Our little Leo Caesar.

575
00:54:50,936 --> 00:54:51,823
Leo Caesar.

576
00:54:55,507 --> 00:54:57,247
Oh, what is that?

577
00:55:01,112 --> 00:55:03,398
They say motherhood changes a woman, but that is too much.

578
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,885
You do not need to worry about such things.

579
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:12,393
I love you more than anything in the world.

580
00:55:13,024 --> 00:55:14,798
I would never let anybody hurt you.

581
00:55:15,994 --> 00:55:16,437
Good night.

582
00:55:17,729 --> 00:55:18,241
How is he?

583
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:19,010
How is he?

584
00:55:19,631 --> 00:55:20,552
How is the child?

585
00:55:20,765 --> 00:55:21,584
Where is Cleopatra?

586
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,184
Can you imagine a woman

587
00:55:24,536 --> 00:55:28,222
Who gave birth to both a baby and a dagger?

588
00:55:33,011 --> 00:55:34,615
Be more careful.

589
00:55:37,315 --> 00:55:38,577
A failure.

590
00:55:39,317 --> 00:55:40,682
That was a perfect opportunity.

591
00:55:41,286 --> 00:55:43,402
He said he would bring us to Rome.

592
00:55:43,655 --> 00:55:48,638
Yes, he will go back after he finalizes the defeat of Egypt.

593
00:55:48,727 --> 00:55:50,433
But he loves me.

594
00:55:51,162 --> 00:55:54,165
You are shameless.
How can you love an invader?

595
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,015
That man has seized your heart and made you lose your will.

596
00:56:01,273 --> 00:56:06,324
But you will kill Caesar in Rome.

597
00:59:44,429 --> 00:59:49,310
I have prepared this celebration and a glorious feast to welcome you.

598
00:59:49,734 --> 00:59:50,621
You are my niece.

599
00:59:51,102 --> 00:59:54,686
If you need anything at all, you just ask me.

600
00:59:54,906 --> 00:59:58,580
Later there will be a gladiatorial competition.

601
00:59:58,808 --> 01:00:01,265
Where men will fight to the death.

602
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,828
Your man Yaonius is scheduled to fight.

603
01:00:04,179 --> 01:00:06,480
If your man defeats the challenger then you will be the champion.

604
01:00:06,754 --> 01:00:09,739
The champion will be richly rewarded.
Very richly rewarded.

605
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:11,691
Can Yaonius win?

606
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:14,208
He should.  The odds are in his favor.

607
01:00:14,492 --> 01:00:17,325
Mark Antony, you are my best friend.

608
01:00:27,872 --> 01:00:30,466
Welcome to the Coliseum for the greatest battle in history!

609
01:00:30,775 --> 01:00:35,041
The battle for the championship of Rome.

610
01:00:35,713 --> 01:00:45,133
In this corner, fighting for Caesar, weighing in at 288lbs: Yaonius!

611
01:00:50,595 --> 01:00:51,619
Who is he?

612
01:00:52,897 --> 01:00:53,716
He looks very strong.

613
01:00:54,532 --> 01:00:58,674
Caesar looks too calm.  He must be up to something.

614
01:00:59,170 --> 01:00:59,613
Huh?

615
01:00:59,938 --> 01:01:02,649
And over in this corner,

616
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:09,157
Twelve-time coliseum champion, weighing in at 581lbs:

617
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:12,856
The big blue bastard!

618
01:01:14,252 --> 01:01:15,002
Kill him quickly.

619
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:19,654
There are three rounds for this competition.

620
01:01:20,058 --> 01:01:22,447
Competitors my use any weapon at any time.

621
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:25,552
Lets get ready to rumble!

622
01:01:39,911 --> 01:01:41,412
That's the end of the first round.

623
01:01:43,982 --> 01:01:45,065
His hand!

624
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,098
Attack his right hand!

625
01:02:35,533 --> 01:02:37,512
Heads or tails?

626
01:02:38,136 --> 01:02:39,637
That's the end of the second round.

627
01:02:40,672 --> 01:02:43,436
Enough playing around.
Use this sword.

628
01:02:57,588 --> 01:02:59,158
Somebody help that man!

629
01:03:29,887 --> 01:03:31,423
Yaonius!

630
01:03:52,310 --> 01:04:00,809
Caesar! Caesar!

631
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:01,807
Well done, Yaonius.

632
01:04:02,253 --> 01:04:05,256
Caesar, give it to me.

633
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,538
Oh, I'll give it to you all right.

634
01:04:11,529 --> 01:04:15,898
Long live Caesar!

635
01:04:17,201 --> 01:04:26,246
Long live Caesar, champion of Rome, Destined to go down in history!

636
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,390
His illness is back.

637
01:04:40,825 --> 01:04:41,985
Be quiet!  Be quiet!

638
01:04:50,001 --> 01:04:52,390
He has been asleep since the incident.

639
01:04:52,904 --> 01:04:53,996
He's tired.

640
01:04:54,672 --> 01:04:57,607
He'll be good as new after a good rest

641
01:04:58,009 --> 01:04:59,647
This is all that Egyptian woman's fault.

642
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:02,402
Father has nothing in common with Cleopatra.

643
01:05:03,147 --> 01:05:04,614
That woman is a savage.

644
01:05:04,816 --> 01:05:06,727
Just let him rest for now, Octavius.

645
01:05:15,593 --> 01:05:18,494
Mommy, I won...

646
01:05:31,509 --> 01:05:40,895
Go ahead and sleep.
I can do all the work myself.

647
01:05:44,622 --> 01:05:45,475
Cleopatra.

648
01:05:45,756 --> 01:05:46,199
Yes.

649
01:05:46,584 --> 01:05:47,916
What do you think you are doing here?

650
01:05:48,192 --> 01:05:49,420
Give me back my husband.

651
01:05:49,827 --> 01:05:50,885
Your husband?

652
01:05:51,395 --> 01:05:52,999
You are mistaken.

653
01:05:53,197 --> 01:05:53,845
The father of my child.

654
01:05:54,065 --> 01:05:54,781
I think not.

655
01:05:54,966 --> 01:05:56,365
Leave Caesar or I will kill you.

656
01:05:56,834 --> 01:05:57,584
Get out.

657
01:05:58,336 --> 01:05:59,701
This man belongs to me.

658
01:05:59,937 --> 01:06:02,940
Then Caesar will be mine after I kill you.

659
01:06:03,908 --> 01:06:05,034
Do you know Apollo Duolia?

660
01:06:05,376 --> 01:06:07,355
She planned for me to kill Caesar,

661
01:06:07,812 --> 01:06:09,484
but I changed my mind.

662
01:06:10,481 --> 01:06:13,450
I will let you live if you leave now and never return.

663
01:06:13,584 --> 01:06:14,096
No!

664
01:06:15,486 --> 01:06:15,998
I will kill you.

665
01:06:27,365 --> 01:06:29,686
Caesar doesn't love you any more.

666
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:30,841
Lying whore!

667
01:06:32,536 --> 01:06:34,447
Wake him and we'll see who he really loves.

668
01:06:34,605 --> 01:06:36,345
That's impossible.

669
01:06:36,607 --> 01:06:38,310
Why don't you get naked and give it a try?

670
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:47,176
Caesar

671
01:06:49,253 --> 01:06:49,833
Eh?

672
01:06:51,022 --> 01:06:54,742
It is your wife.

673
01:06:55,726 --> 01:06:56,340
Mommy?

674
01:06:57,595 --> 01:06:58,584
Are you my mommy?

675
01:07:00,231 --> 01:07:01,323
I am Cleopatra.

676
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:03,754
Oh, it's you.

677
01:07:05,336 --> 01:07:06,496
Where is my mommy?

678
01:07:07,638 --> 01:07:08,969
Wouldn't you like to come with me?

679
01:07:10,007 --> 01:07:10,621
Mommy!

680
01:07:11,309 --> 01:07:14,005
Yes, my son?

681
01:07:15,346 --> 01:07:16,301
I had a nightmare.

682
01:07:17,915 --> 01:07:18,700
I dreamt I died.

683
01:07:19,317 --> 01:07:20,545
Silly boy.

684
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:22,986
Mother will protect you.

685
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:25,669
Sleep now my beautiful child.

686
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:28,201
I'm afraid to sleep alone!

687
01:07:28,759 --> 01:07:32,172
OK, OK, you can sleep with mother.

688
01:07:33,597 --> 01:07:35,610
Do you understand?  This is Caesar.

689
01:07:36,934 --> 01:07:40,108
The man regresses to a child-like state whenever he comes to Rome.

690
01:07:41,005 --> 01:07:45,101
You are just a conquered whore who wants to trade sex for power.

691
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:51,097
No man could ever love a greedy whore like you.  Not as a man loves a wife.

692
01:07:52,183 --> 01:07:54,159
Go back to Egypt, Cleopatra.

693
01:07:58,222 --> 01:08:03,956
That man does not love me.
That man has never loved me!

694
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:35,508
Caesar is everywhere.

695
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:38,658
The people of Rome are inundated by his image.

696
01:08:39,263 --> 01:08:40,560
He claims to be a god.

697
01:08:41,022 --> 01:08:42,310
It is an eye-sore.

698
01:08:42,874 --> 01:08:44,213
Or more like a public health hazard.

699
01:08:44,702 --> 01:08:46,476
This trend must be stopped.

700
01:08:47,938 --> 01:08:48,552
Brutus

701
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:51,861
The senate chairman has been bought out by Caesar.

702
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:53,707
Now he can pass any law.

703
01:08:54,145 --> 01:08:55,496
That is not all.

704
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:59,832
Antonius, Octavius, Lumanicus, Levicus.

705
01:09:00,217 --> 01:09:01,991
How can Caesar pay off so many senators?

706
01:09:03,354 --> 01:09:05,231
Julius Caesar

707
01:09:06,323 --> 01:09:09,294
I propose we build a temple devoted to Caesar.

708
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,812
The people need a place to worship me.

709
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:18,882
All those in favor of the proposal to build a temple of Caesar, please stand up.

710
01:09:19,003 --> 01:09:21,187
All those opposed, state your opposition.

711
01:09:22,006 --> 01:09:22,654
I have something to say.

712
01:09:23,207 --> 01:09:24,504
Cicero.

713
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:26,683
This senate is a farce.

714
01:09:27,111 --> 01:09:32,879
Half of the senators do not bother to show up.
The other half are corrupt.

715
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:33,375
Chairman,

716
01:09:33,582 --> 01:09:34,228
I have a response.

717
01:09:34,518 --> 01:09:35,883
Caesar.

718
01:09:36,053 --> 01:09:42,504
Cicero is not in possession of all of the pertinent details.
The senate is functioning perfectly.

719
01:09:42,827 --> 01:09:47,350
That sounds reasonable.
Cicero's comments are stricken
from the record.

720
01:09:47,565 --> 01:09:49,442
Caesar's proposal passes.

721
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:54,260
The temple will be built immediately.
This session is closed.

722
01:09:54,714 --> 01:09:56,023
Oh shit!

723
01:10:00,945 --> 01:10:03,334
Caesar or one of his cronies steals every vote.

724
01:10:03,881 --> 01:10:04,905
Something must be done.

725
01:10:05,149 --> 01:10:06,480
Don't worry about Caesar.

726
01:10:07,618 --> 01:10:09,119
I will pay him a visit.

727
01:10:09,487 --> 01:10:10,374
Right now.

728
01:10:10,988 --> 01:10:12,012
Brutus

729
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:15,397
Oh, it's Cleopatra's creepy old lady friend.

730
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:18,560
Cleopatra would like to speak to you.

731
01:10:20,264 --> 01:10:21,697
Please kill him.

732
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,938
Isn't that a bit harsh?

733
01:10:25,169 --> 01:10:27,046
I can't do something like that.

734
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:29,388
He wants absolute power over Rome.

735
01:10:29,874 --> 01:10:33,219
Rome is a democracy.  Caesar must not be allowed to seize power.

736
01:10:33,344 --> 01:10:34,129
That isn't possible.

737
01:10:34,378 --> 01:10:35,777
You can't just go around killing people.

738
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:37,277
He must die.

739
01:10:37,548 --> 01:10:40,620
Just because he dumped you does not mean he deserves to die.

740
01:10:42,353 --> 01:10:43,001
What's that?

741
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:47,416
Think of this as a political donation from Cleopatra to Brutus.

742
01:10:48,225 --> 01:10:50,307
A bribe?  Don't be ridiculous.

743
01:10:50,528 --> 01:10:52,814
I will keep piling on bags of gold until you say stop.

744
01:10:53,397 --> 01:10:54,830
You're being serious?

745
01:10:54,999 --> 01:10:56,336
It is for the common good.

746
01:10:57,268 --> 01:10:58,189
Don't joke like that.

747
01:10:58,369 --> 01:10:59,256
This is no joke.

748
01:10:59,937 --> 01:11:00,858
How will I spend all that?

749
01:11:01,138 --> 01:11:02,196
That's up to you.

750
01:13:29,453 --> 01:13:31,978
Et tu, Bruté?

751
01:14:44,094 --> 01:14:45,049
Caesar!

752
01:14:46,263 --> 01:14:47,082
Caesar!

753
01:14:47,664 --> 01:14:49,473
Caesar is dead!

754
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:54,082
Caesar died!  Caesar was killed!

755
01:14:57,775 --> 01:14:59,003
Bring Yaonius here.

756
01:14:59,643 --> 01:15:00,871
We must leave Rome quickly.

757
01:15:02,146 --> 01:15:04,194
Rome without him is pointless.

758
01:15:15,192 --> 01:15:15,908
Yaonius?

759
01:15:17,161 --> 01:15:17,468
Yes?

760
01:15:19,163 --> 01:15:21,108
Are you happy to be going back to Egypt?

761
01:15:21,999 --> 01:15:23,330
Libia is waiting for you.

762
01:15:25,702 --> 01:15:29,866
But who is waiting for me?

763
01:16:35,639 --> 01:16:36,424
Yaonius!

764
01:16:37,341 --> 01:16:37,921
Libia!

765
01:16:40,777 --> 01:16:41,425
Libia!

766
01:16:59,897 --> 01:17:02,081
Mark Antony is coming from Rome to see you.

767
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:04,818
Has it been a whole year already?

768
01:17:05,068 --> 01:17:07,593
It is said he is already entranced by your beauty.

769
01:17:08,438 --> 01:17:09,666
Just like Caesar.

770
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,693
Exactly.

771
01:17:11,775 --> 01:17:15,632
Mark Antony is just like Caesar.

772
01:17:15,879 --> 01:17:17,585
He will be easy to control.

773
01:17:25,322 --> 01:17:29,042
This meeting with Cleopatra must go well.

774
01:17:30,193 --> 01:17:32,855
Are you feeling OK Mark Antony?

775
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:35,758
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

776
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:38,077
Then why are you so nervous?

777
01:17:39,536 --> 01:17:41,652
You would not understand, Kaba.

778
01:17:41,972 --> 01:17:42,893
It's Kabanius.

779
01:17:43,407 --> 01:17:44,669
Yes, yes, I always forget the «nius».

780
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:46,069
You used to just be «Kaba»

781
01:17:46,376 --> 01:17:49,550
The saying goes «To get a Tiger, grab its ass»

782
01:17:50,113 --> 01:17:52,741
Or «To get a tiger cub, fuck a tigress».

783
01:17:52,849 --> 01:17:53,873
Either one works.

784
01:17:55,852 --> 01:17:58,787
I'm sure Cleopatra will enjoy your crude jokes.

785
01:17:58,956 --> 01:18:00,218
She will, Kaba.

786
01:18:00,357 --> 01:18:01,346
Kabanius.

787
01:18:01,592 --> 01:18:02,650
I know, I know.

788
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:05,132
What does any of this have to do with war?

789
01:18:05,462 --> 01:18:06,861
I don't know.

790
01:18:07,331 --> 01:18:08,969
What about Egypt?

791
01:18:09,399 --> 01:18:12,027
What if Cleopatra asks for advice about running the country?

792
01:18:12,636 --> 01:18:14,684
You will have to help me.

793
01:18:15,238 --> 01:18:16,159
I understand.

794
01:18:21,678 --> 01:18:23,999
I will speak to her myself.

795
01:18:24,681 --> 01:18:26,967
What am I going to do?

796
01:18:31,755 --> 01:18:32,710
I'm scared.

797
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:36,081
Man up and do what you must.

798
01:18:37,094 --> 01:18:37,879
You're not helping.

799
01:18:38,495 --> 01:18:43,888
It..it..it is I, Mark Antony, come to speak with Cleopatra.

800
01:18:49,906 --> 01:18:51,100
Welcome.

801
01:18:51,241 --> 01:18:52,981
I have missed you, Mark Antony.

802
01:18:53,343 --> 01:18:57,200
I haven't seen you since I left Rome.

803
01:18:57,314 --> 01:18:57,996
I am so happy.

804
01:18:59,829 --> 01:19:03,037
Oh, you've gone all stiff and hard.

805
01:19:03,153 --> 01:19:06,805
I believe a man should be stiff and hard.

806
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:10,983
I'm glad you think so.  It takes a stiff man to satisfy me.

807
01:19:13,597 --> 01:19:19,297
Here, let's drink a toast to our happy reunion.

808
01:19:19,369 --> 01:19:23,703
When I see a beautiful woman, um, not that I look at a lot of them...

809
01:19:24,141 --> 01:19:26,530
No, what I meant to say is...

810
01:19:26,777 --> 01:19:27,323
Hold on.

811
01:19:28,178 --> 01:19:29,918
What was I trying to say?

812
01:19:30,881 --> 01:19:31,802
A beautiful woman.

813
01:19:32,015 --> 01:19:34,882
Yes, when I see a beautiful woman,

814
01:19:35,218 --> 01:19:36,685
I get confused.

815
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,718
Nonsense.  You speak like a poet.

816
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:47,416
Ah, good wine.

817
01:19:48,398 --> 01:19:52,528
This wine is called «A delightful kiss»

818
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:54,759
Delightful kiss?

819
01:19:55,338 --> 01:19:57,795
Yes, just like this.

820
01:20:02,446 --> 01:20:03,162
Was that delightful?

821
01:20:04,014 --> 01:20:04,526
Yes.

822
01:20:05,582 --> 01:20:06,264
Would you like more?

823
01:20:06,516 --> 01:20:07,198
Yes.

824
01:20:31,341 --> 01:20:32,126
You stopped.

825
01:20:32,609 --> 01:20:33,189
Why?

826
01:20:33,543 --> 01:20:34,601
This ring,

827
01:20:34,745 --> 01:20:36,656
This is Caesar's ring.

828
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,283
Yes, he left it to me.

829
01:20:38,615 --> 01:20:43,871
When I wear this ring, I am Caesar's official deputy.
I carry on his legacy.

830
01:20:44,121 --> 01:20:46,100
Did you love Caesar?

831
01:20:47,224 --> 01:20:48,213
I respect his memory.

832
01:20:49,526 --> 01:20:50,447
And now I will pass it on to you.

833
01:20:51,762 --> 01:20:52,956
Hey, what the fuck?

834
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:55,073
Forget the dead.
The past is the past.

835
01:20:55,999 --> 01:20:59,275
All that matters now is the two of us.

836
01:21:10,947 --> 01:21:11,732
What's wrong?

837
01:21:12,382 --> 01:21:14,532
I can't do this.

838
01:21:14,918 --> 01:21:16,112
Why not?

839
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,455
I cannot satisfy you like he did.

840
01:21:20,657 --> 01:21:23,455
I have a small dick.

841
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:26,587
It's pathetic compared to Caesar's.

842
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:29,724
Oh don't be ridiculous.

843
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,945
That doesn't matter.

844
01:21:34,771 --> 01:21:35,965
Let me show you.

845
01:21:37,073 --> 01:21:40,520
Say «Ahhh»

846
01:21:46,817 --> 01:21:47,602
What do you taste?

847
01:21:48,084 --> 01:21:49,346
I don't know.  I swallowed it.

848
01:21:49,619 --> 01:21:50,813
Now, try this one.

849
01:21:51,354 --> 01:21:53,231
Say «Ahhh»

850
01:21:57,761 --> 01:21:59,843
Did you taste that one?

851
01:22:00,263 --> 01:22:03,266
You see Mark Antony, size is not important.

852
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:07,647
Cleopatra

853
01:22:08,138 --> 01:22:11,107
Get ready for a hard dicking.

854
01:22:11,808 --> 01:22:13,002
Bombs away!

855
01:22:58,788 --> 01:23:00,494
How did you like that?

856
01:23:01,391 --> 01:23:03,200
Oh, you're the best I've ever had.

857
01:23:08,798 --> 01:23:11,904
You are being manipulated by Cleopatra.

858
01:23:12,369 --> 01:23:14,246
She will ruin you.

859
01:23:15,438 --> 01:23:16,154
No, Kaba.

860
01:23:16,806 --> 01:23:17,625
Kabanius

861
01:23:18,008 --> 01:23:18,895
That's what I said.

862
01:23:19,643 --> 01:23:21,349
Cleopatra is good.

863
01:23:21,945 --> 01:23:23,071
No, she's great.

864
01:23:23,847 --> 01:23:26,987
I would gladly lay down my life for that woman.

865
01:23:27,317 --> 01:23:28,579
You're a mess.

866
01:23:29,519 --> 01:23:34,331
You have 200 thousand troops under your command.

867
01:23:34,925 --> 01:23:36,836
If you conquer Egypt,

868
01:23:37,327 --> 01:23:39,477
you can conquer the world.

869
01:23:39,696 --> 01:23:40,481
The world.

870
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:46,107
There may be some truth to that.

871
01:23:48,204 --> 01:23:49,705
Yes.  You must leave Cleopatra.

872
01:23:50,106 --> 01:23:51,334
Go east.

873
01:23:52,108 --> 01:23:52,654
I will.

874
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:56,613
To conquer the world for Cleopatra!

875
01:24:27,744 --> 01:24:29,723
Prepare Mark Antony's bed.

876
01:24:30,213 --> 01:24:30,520
Yes sir.

877
01:24:52,102 --> 01:24:52,955
You look like hell.

878
01:24:54,371 --> 01:24:59,149
You would have conquered the world by now if that woman hadn't turned you into such a pansy.

879
01:25:02,812 --> 01:25:05,167
Why are you babbling like a retard?

880
01:25:05,782 --> 01:25:07,010
Get rid of Cleopatra.

881
01:25:24,401 --> 01:25:26,756
Thank you for your hospitality.

882
01:25:27,237 --> 01:25:30,206
I think the king has something to say.

883
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:31,700
What's on your mind, Siluodiao?

884
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:34,556
Leave us.

885
01:25:44,287 --> 01:25:45,959
Kill Cleopatra.

886
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:48,541
Listen to me.

887
01:25:48,825 --> 01:25:51,931
Cleopatra killed Caesar.

888
01:25:52,662 --> 01:25:55,358
She will kill you next unless you kill her first.

889
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,864
That's crazy.
Stop joking around.

890
01:26:00,136 --> 01:26:01,160
Listen to me.

891
01:26:02,305 --> 01:26:06,127
Cleopatra brought nothing but bad luck to Rome.

892
01:26:06,509 --> 01:26:10,639
I don't know what you're talking about.

893
01:26:11,314 --> 01:26:13,703
This is ridiculous.

894
01:26:14,084 --> 01:26:15,005
Kill Cleopatra.

895
01:26:16,152 --> 01:26:17,585
Either she dies,

896
01:26:17,887 --> 01:26:19,286
or you will die.

897
01:26:19,656 --> 01:26:20,406
I don't believe it.

898
01:26:21,024 --> 01:26:23,174
I can't believe it.

899
01:26:23,393 --> 01:26:24,485
Kill Cleopatra!

900
01:26:25,095 --> 01:26:25,607
Kill her!

901
01:26:27,931 --> 01:26:30,422
What happened Mark Antony?

902
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,979
No..nothing.

903
01:26:33,703 --> 01:26:35,136
I'm just a bit tired.

904
01:26:35,605 --> 01:26:36,082
Report!

905
01:26:36,506 --> 01:26:39,270
Octavius has taken control of Rome with 130 thousand soldiers.

906
01:26:39,342 --> 01:26:42,004
They are fighting your supporters.

907
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,483
Transfer all my troops from Alexandria back to Rome

908
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:23,029
All my warships too.

909
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:25,093
Understand?

910
01:27:25,588 --> 01:27:30,776
Mark Antony will be victorious!

911
01:27:31,794 --> 01:27:32,715
One more bottle.

912
01:27:44,073 --> 01:27:46,564
The perfect poison.

913
01:27:46,976 --> 01:27:51,891
It should take effect in the midst of battle.

914
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:03,396
We must take the fight out of the soldiers.

915
01:28:04,027 --> 01:28:08,566
OK ladies, you know what to do.
Fuck them till they
can't even stand up.

916
01:29:13,129 --> 01:29:14,596
Sweet.

917
01:29:22,472 --> 01:29:24,588
What are you doing, Kaba?

918
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:33,208
Where the hell is everybody?

919
01:29:34,851 --> 01:29:36,625
Yaonius should be here.

920
01:29:37,487 --> 01:29:39,603
He's a special case.

921
01:29:40,123 --> 01:29:41,522
I can count on him.

922
01:29:42,759 --> 01:29:43,305
Definitely.

923
01:29:46,462 --> 01:29:49,260
I had no idea your girls would be so effective,

924
01:29:49,299 --> 01:29:49,879
Libia.

925
01:29:50,233 --> 01:29:51,188
Sex is a weapon.

926
01:29:51,834 --> 01:29:52,414
It sure is.

927
01:29:52,702 --> 01:29:55,125
Mark Antony was totally fooled.

928
01:29:55,672 --> 01:29:57,378
We'll kill the general first, then the soldiers.

929
01:29:57,974 --> 01:29:58,929
This will be the end of Mark Antony.

930
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:01,460
Say it again.

931
01:30:01,944 --> 01:30:03,241
Call me an idiot.

932
01:30:03,446 --> 01:30:05,404
Come on, say it to my face!

933
01:30:06,082 --> 01:30:06,764
Bastard.

934
01:30:07,684 --> 01:30:09,629
Who put you up to this?

935
01:30:10,586 --> 01:30:12,190
Was it Cleopatra?

936
01:30:13,456 --> 01:30:14,582
Was it Cleopatra?

937
01:30:15,024 --> 01:30:16,560
I see the answer in your face.

938
01:30:17,427 --> 01:30:19,884
I should have known that bitch was up to something.

939
01:30:20,496 --> 01:30:22,509
OK, now I am pissed.

940
01:30:23,132 --> 01:30:25,453
I am going to kill Cleopatra.

941
01:30:26,536 --> 01:30:30,563
And I will kill every last traitor involved in this plan.

942
01:30:30,873 --> 01:30:32,067
Starting with you.

943
01:30:48,925 --> 01:30:50,290
It can't end like this.

944
01:30:50,827 --> 01:30:51,885
I have failed.

945
01:30:52,528 --> 01:30:53,756
I really mean it this time.

946
01:30:55,798 --> 01:30:58,358
It is quite hard to pick a winner this time.

947
01:31:48,251 --> 01:31:52,415
Rock, paper, scissors.

948
01:31:52,655 --> 01:31:53,303
I win!

949
01:32:59,422 --> 01:33:02,152
Load up the crossbows!

950
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:03,996
Hoist the sails!

951
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:05,442
Listen to me.

952
01:33:05,695 --> 01:33:07,767
Full speed ahead, We can take them.

953
01:33:30,686 --> 01:33:33,621
Their boat looks much bigger up close.

954
01:33:42,265 --> 01:33:45,850
Oh god, is this really the end?

955
01:34:32,548 --> 01:34:34,800
Congratulations.

956
01:34:35,551 --> 01:34:37,599
I heard that Mark Antony has been totally defeated.

957
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:41,677
He will be killed and his corpse thrown into the sea.

958
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:43,557
Haha

959
01:34:44,694 --> 01:34:45,171
No.

960
01:34:49,365 --> 01:34:51,174
I know all about Mark Antony.

961
01:34:51,601 --> 01:34:54,809
Why?  What business is it of yours?

962
01:34:57,607 --> 01:34:59,450
He hates me.

963
01:35:00,443 --> 01:35:02,422
Because he trusted me.

964
01:35:02,712 --> 01:35:03,292
My queen,

965
01:35:04,347 --> 01:35:05,780
What is wrong with you?

966
01:35:11,354 --> 01:35:13,265
Mark Antony has returned!

967
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:15,962
Cleopatra!

968
01:35:17,193 --> 01:35:18,148
He has a sword.

969
01:35:18,327 --> 01:35:20,033
Your highness, you are in danger!

970
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:21,539
My queen.

971
01:35:31,507 --> 01:35:33,759
I am here, Mark Antony.

972
01:35:34,644 --> 01:35:39,627
Cleopatra, where are you?

973
01:35:39,782 --> 01:35:40,942
Mark Antony

974
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:47,253
I recognize your scent.

975
01:35:48,424 --> 01:35:52,485
I wanted to come back, now I am back.

976
01:35:52,703 --> 01:35:53,842
It was worth it.

977
01:35:54,363 --> 01:35:58,322
I am so tired.
Please ki..ki..

978
01:35:58,868 --> 01:35:59,960
Kiss you?

979
01:36:00,169 --> 01:36:04,572
Yes, I need you to kiss me.

980
01:36:15,007 --> 01:36:18,522
Thank you, for a sweet last kiss.

981
01:36:23,793 --> 01:36:25,670
Mark Antony, don't die!

982
01:36:27,596 --> 01:36:29,712
Mark Antony!

983
01:37:19,749 --> 01:37:23,367
No. No.

984
01:37:34,663 --> 01:37:39,714
First Caesar was killed, then Mark Antony was killed too.

985
01:37:42,438 --> 01:37:44,554
Now it is Octavius.

986
01:37:46,108 --> 01:37:48,224
When will it all end?

987
01:37:49,378 --> 01:37:51,187
It will never end, Cleopatra.

988
01:37:52,548 --> 01:37:58,862
As long as Egypt is under attack, it can never end.

989
01:37:59,488 --> 01:38:02,491
It's too much, too much.

990
01:38:02,858 --> 01:38:05,827
Apollo Duolia, change me back to the way I was!

991
01:38:06,395 --> 01:38:08,135
Do you even remember your life before?

992
01:38:08,297 --> 01:38:12,905
I was plain and normal, with a simple life.
I want that life again.

993
01:38:12,968 --> 01:38:13,411
What do you want?

994
01:38:13,669 --> 01:38:14,556
My original face.

995
01:38:14,637 --> 01:38:15,183
What else?

996
01:38:15,738 --> 01:38:16,250
Love.

997
01:38:16,472 --> 01:38:16,984
Meaningless.

998
01:38:17,139 --> 01:38:19,494
I want to be an ordinary woman again.

999
01:38:19,809 --> 01:38:22,744
So I can have the the things that ordinary women get to have.

1000
01:38:22,812 --> 01:38:23,767
Will you reconsider?

1001
01:38:24,013 --> 01:38:25,207
No, I have made up my mind.

1002
01:38:25,414 --> 01:38:28,178
Do you not care for the fate of Egypt?

1003
01:38:28,984 --> 01:38:31,953
How can you be so weak, Queen Cleopatra?

1004
01:38:32,655 --> 01:38:34,361
Don't ignore me!

1005
01:38:53,275 --> 01:38:54,249
Where do you want to go?

1006
01:38:54,743 --> 01:38:57,371
Anywhere I can be free and lead a normal life.

1007
01:38:58,314 --> 01:39:00,191
There is no more freedom in Egypt.

1008
01:39:05,621 --> 01:39:09,819
Cleopatra has disappeared.

1009
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:11,356
Yes, I'm sorry.

1010
01:39:12,027 --> 01:39:16,088
You will find her or you will die.

1011
01:39:16,232 --> 01:39:18,621
Don't worry, I will find her.

1012
01:39:31,847 --> 01:39:35,738
I can't hear you over the wind.
We'll have to talk in
speech bubbles.

1013
01:39:36,285 --> 01:39:39,800
We need to get out of this sand storm.

1014
01:39:40,222 --> 01:39:43,567
I think I see something ahead.

1015
01:39:46,195 --> 01:39:47,696
Is is a giant rock?

1016
01:39:54,803 --> 01:39:55,997
What is that?

1017
01:39:56,538 --> 01:39:58,927
It has the body of a lion and the head of a man.

1018
01:40:03,178 --> 01:40:04,884
This is the tomb of a king.

1019
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:22,278
It's automated.

1020
01:40:26,402 --> 01:40:27,596
The entrance to a temple.

1021
01:40:29,538 --> 01:40:30,152
Anybody home?

1022
01:40:37,046 --> 01:40:38,740
Wait, there are instructions.

1023
01:40:39,615 --> 01:40:41,765
«Welcome to OOKAI tomb»

1024
01:40:42,451 --> 01:40:44,976
Whoever wishes to enter,

1025
01:40:45,087 --> 01:40:48,705
Must first relinquish their mortal coil, or in other words, die.

1026
01:40:48,891 --> 01:40:52,167
There are many varied and interesting ways to die here.

1027
01:40:52,328 --> 01:40:54,273
For details, see the instruction manual.

1028
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:58,479
In the 1st room, you will be crushed by falling stones.

1029
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:01,876
In the 2nd room, you will be buried alive.

1030
01:41:02,071 --> 01:41:06,167
Room three contains poisonous snakes.

1031
01:41:06,275 --> 01:41:07,503
Room four...

1032
01:41:07,643 --> 01:41:08,564
Enough, Yaonius.

1033
01:41:09,912 --> 01:41:12,915
We are not safe here.
This is some sort of temple of death.

1034
01:41:13,716 --> 01:41:14,432
Let's go.

1035
01:41:28,897 --> 01:41:30,330
It won't budge.

1036
01:41:30,899 --> 01:41:31,820
I think it opens from the outside only.

1037
01:41:32,134 --> 01:41:32,372
Oh.

1038
01:41:33,135 --> 01:41:34,432
We can't open it from here.

1039
01:41:52,021 --> 01:41:53,352
You cannot enter here.

1040
01:41:53,689 --> 01:41:55,975
Cleopatra must be inside.

1041
01:41:57,326 --> 01:41:58,111
You are protecting her.

1042
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:00,537
This is the tomb of a king.

1043
01:42:00,996 --> 01:42:03,282
You can't go in.

1044
01:42:04,033 --> 01:42:04,408
Move.

1045
01:42:04,967 --> 01:42:08,516
Please.  Wait out here.
I will go inside and look.

1046
01:42:08,771 --> 01:42:11,160
I will bring Cleopatra out.

1047
01:42:11,373 --> 01:42:13,113
Please just wait out here.

1048
01:42:30,692 --> 01:42:31,989
Cleopatra

1049
01:42:36,265 --> 01:42:39,507
You have come at last.

1050
01:42:40,069 --> 01:42:40,785
Yes

1051
01:42:43,038 --> 01:42:45,461
What is it you want from Egypt?

1052
01:42:45,574 --> 01:42:47,383
I want you, to begin with.

1053
01:42:47,943 --> 01:42:52,755
I am a Queen with no power, but you are a hero.

1054
01:42:54,183 --> 01:42:56,162
I think it will be different this time around.

1055
01:42:58,353 --> 01:43:00,435
You look so beautiful.

1056
01:43:00,589 --> 01:43:01,783
Only for you.

1057
01:43:03,759 --> 01:43:04,680
Octavius,

1058
01:43:06,395 --> 01:43:10,729
Ever since we met back in Rome,

1059
01:43:11,934 --> 01:43:13,572
You have left an impression on my heart.

1060
01:43:14,336 --> 01:43:16,691
So you've missed me?

1061
01:43:17,372 --> 01:43:17,815
Yes

1062
01:43:18,807 --> 01:43:21,469
I will bring you back to Rome.

1063
01:43:22,911 --> 01:43:23,627
Really?

1064
01:43:24,546 --> 01:43:30,690
I will take you back as a captive.
You can watch me rebuild Rome
from inside a cage.

1065
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:36,525
I am nothing like Caesar or Mark Antony.  You are useless to me.

1066
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:41,732
But I will take you back with me anyway, as a trophy.

1067
01:43:42,531 --> 01:43:44,920
You shouldn't joke like that.

1068
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:54,793
I am still young.  I can love you like no other. I can make you the greatest king in the world.

1069
01:43:55,144 --> 01:44:01,424
Compare the world to Rome.
Think about it, Octavius.

1070
01:44:02,017 --> 01:44:04,167
My Queen, I've come for you.

1071
01:44:08,957 --> 01:44:10,936
Your warrior.

1072
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,076
Yaonius.

1073
01:44:13,028 --> 01:44:16,646
Oh!  I have heard about you!  Nice to meet you!

1074
01:44:16,899 --> 01:44:18,878
Just look at this body.

1075
01:44:24,973 --> 01:44:27,157
I heard all about you back in Rome.
Imagine meeting you way out here.

1076
01:44:27,176 --> 01:44:28,541
I lose sleep thinking of you.

1077
01:44:28,677 --> 01:44:32,261
It's true.  Sometimes I can't fall asleep.

1078
01:44:32,447 --> 01:44:36,235
I am so happy, and you are so gorgeous.

1079
01:44:36,485 --> 01:44:40,717
You must come live with me, OK, my darling?

1080
01:44:42,024 --> 01:44:42,843
Octavius?

1081
01:44:45,227 --> 01:44:50,347
I will go back with you if you will wait for five minutes.

1082
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:53,107
OK, five minutes.

1083
01:44:53,635 --> 01:44:54,112
My Queen.

1084
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:55,411
Libia?

1085
01:44:55,938 --> 01:44:56,245
Yes?

1086
01:44:57,306 --> 01:44:59,012
Bring me to the third room.

1087
01:44:59,441 --> 01:45:00,260
But your highness,

1088
01:45:01,043 --> 01:45:02,374
that room...

1089
01:45:03,011 --> 01:45:04,444
You mustn't go there!

1090
01:45:04,646 --> 01:45:05,123
Why not?

1091
01:45:05,948 --> 01:45:09,839
I do this as my final act as queen of Egypt.

1092
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:57,460
Thank you for all you have done for me.

1093
01:45:57,733 --> 01:45:58,483
Cleopatra

1094
01:45:59,001 --> 01:45:59,615
My Queen.

1095
01:46:00,669 --> 01:46:01,146
Libia?

1096
01:46:01,703 --> 01:46:02,044
Yes?

1097
01:46:02,537 --> 01:46:05,643
You said there was no freedom left in Egypt.

1098
01:46:07,409 --> 01:46:07,955
But there is.

1099
01:46:09,144 --> 01:46:13,001
I have found it in your loving heart.

1100
01:46:19,454 --> 01:46:23,208
Mark Antony, come take me away.

1101
01:46:26,528 --> 01:46:35,232
I will be with Mark Antony in the afterlife.

1102
01:46:37,306 --> 01:46:41,231
So don't cry for me, Libia.

1103
01:46:44,112 --> 01:46:47,627
Mark Antony, I am ready.

1104
01:46:49,751 --> 01:46:51,321
Mark Antony...

1105
01:46:55,891 --> 01:46:59,816
You highness!
Your highness!

1106
01:47:16,378 --> 01:47:20,064
Look Libia, an air shaft.  Maybe we can escape through there.

1107
01:47:32,561 --> 01:47:33,141
Luck is with us.

1108
01:47:34,062 --> 01:47:35,867
Libia, it is time to go.

1109
01:47:59,087 --> 01:48:27,861
Roman troops, get out!

1110
01:48:43,098 --> 01:48:46,135
Thank you.  Is there anything else you would like to add?

1111
01:48:46,635 --> 01:48:47,624
No.

1112
01:48:47,969 --> 01:48:49,812
Haluwei, how is Luba?

1113
01:48:52,707 --> 01:48:54,925
OK then, the Cleopatra Plan...

1114
01:49:04,786 --> 01:49:08,950
Cleopatra Plan No.1548 Report

1115
01:49:08,924 --> 01:49:19,095
The marriage task force is in place and operatives are attached to nearly all the planet's leaders.

1116
01:49:19,801 --> 01:49:29,085
Everything is going to plan, and the operatives are prepared.

1117
01:49:29,811 --> 01:49:36,023
It seems to be 90% effective.
We await the final kill order.

1118
01:49:36,785 --> 01:49:39,925
Lead Invasion Officer, Pasateli Army.
