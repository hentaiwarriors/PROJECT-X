1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,070
You're surprised by what comes
to your mind all of a sudden...

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,800
And try to remember them
by turning back the clock.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,110
lrreparable time...

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,570
Things didn't go smoothly then,
but it's different now.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,390
lf l can live with you from now on...

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,750
...then l'll have no regrets.

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,560
Now and forever...

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,230
Even if everything
happened in a split second...

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,900
l will always be here.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,310
From then and beyond.

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,150
So l wish l could see you here again.

12
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,450
According to this report, we only
know that the suspect is missing.

13
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,850
l want to get a search warrant and
look around the suspect's apartment.

14
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,050
lt's just a gun, isn't it?

15
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,650
But it's true that the gun
has been used in the murder.

16
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,800
You want to hear my honest
opinion, Chief Morikawa?

17
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,890
What do you make of it?

18
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,300
The murder did take place.

19
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,240
But l don't think the entire department
should've been called out.

20
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,810
What do you think?

21
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,310
Yes, you're right.

22
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,690
But l guess we had no choice
but to make that move.

23
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,680
We'll assign four departments to this
case, and recover the gun secretly.

24
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,130
The file says to send in two members
from each department.

25
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,270
But we do things a bit
differently from time to time.

26
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,600
Make sure this doesn't go public.

27
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,040
l understand.

28
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,520
l'm amazed to see that the department
is sending two members...

29
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,280
To take on this scandalous case.

30
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,090
You heard me talking.

31
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,620
l just used the department
to take action.

32
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,470
lt's the new owner of the gun.

33
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,140
l don't care what you do, but
maybe you should take it easy.

34
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,870
Well, it seems you
care about me now, huh?

35
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,680
l'm not worried about you.

36
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,850
l'll come back if there's a new owner.

37
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,090
Kaminada.

38
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,560
Be careful with what
you have in your pocket.

39
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,930
You mean this?

40
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,660
To tell you the truth,
l'm an upright citizen.

41
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,880
My family is a bit weird.

42
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,910
They all know it, but
they don't speak about it.

43
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,220
We're all bunch of strangers,
but they say we're a family.

44
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,160
Family...

45
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,630
What is the meaning of family?

46
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,890
Yu, this will be your mother
from now on.

47
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,970
Nice to meet you.

48
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,950
You're starting to
look like your father.

49
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,080
Really?

50
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,610
Yes.

51
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,120
l don't really remember, but
was dad a really handsome guy?

52
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,530
Yes, very.

53
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:17,510
Yes, very.

54
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,570
Yu, l hope you grow up and
look just like your father.

55
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,960
Thank you for this meal.

56
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,650
Mother!

57
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,380
What's wrong?

58
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,030
Aren't you gonna continue?

59
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,750
l'll keep on watching.

60
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,980
You wanted me to do this, right?

61
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,200
Mother...

62
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,970
Why?

63
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,680
Hey, you started treating me
as if l'm not your mother, right?

64
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,480
lf l was your real mother,
you wouldn't be doing this, right?

65
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,750
No matter how many years
we've lived together...

66
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,660
We're still just a bunch of strangers.

67
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,930
Well...

68
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,130
l'm heading out!

69
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,600
See you later.

70
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,830
l'm heading out...

71
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,650
What's wrong?

72
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,890
Ah, l forgot something.

73
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,120
Sorry to say this, but can
you go ahead without me?

74
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,420
Okay, sure.

75
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,500
Mother...

76
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,330
Mother...

77
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,800
Yu...

78
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,100
l'm not your mother.

79
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,910
Misako...

80
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,710
Yu...

81
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,650
Aren't you gonna come soon?

82
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,360
Yeah.

83
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,440
l'm disappointed.

84
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,060
Yu...

85
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,930
lt hurts!

86
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,060
Bad boy...

87
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,580
And?

88
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,450
lt went just as planned.

89
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,320
l already told X about it.

90
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,460
That punk...

91
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,590
What do you wanna do?

92
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,330
You know what l'm gonna do!

93
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,030
That's my gun!

94
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,580
What are you gonna do?

95
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,620
Well...

96
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,080
l wanna know what will happen, so...

97
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,660
You wanna know what
will happen too, right?

98
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,190
Chief, where exactly are we going?

99
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,480
We're not going to that suspect's...

100
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,360
We're just on patrol.

101
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,330
lt looks like l won't be
getting a promotion soon.

102
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,030
Oh, you were expecting a promotion?

103
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,670
Just kidding.

104
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,320
Why isn't anybody picking up the
phone?

105
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,650
Yes?

106
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,230
My name is Mizutani,
and l'm Yu's teacher.

107
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,890
Wait one second please.

108
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,700
Miss Mizutani...

109
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,930
Thank you so much for coming.

110
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,070
Sorry to keep you waiting.

111
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,840
Hello Miss Mizutani...

112
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,780
Are you feeling well?

113
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,410
Excuse me...

114
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,310
l just came to check how Yu was
feeling...

115
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,310
Goodbye.

116
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,390
Miss Mizutani,
you should stay a bit longer.

117
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,930
What did you...

118
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,530
Oh my...

119
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,340
Are you okay?

120
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,060
No...

121
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,110
How does it feel, Yu?

122
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,710
lt's a bit different from you, Misako.

123
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,110
Really?

124
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,790
Hey, can l release it inside?

125
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,090
No...

126
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,750
Don't release it inside.

127
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,190
Do whatever you like.

128
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,390
Then l'll release it inside.

129
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,290
Well? Are you satisfied?

130
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,290
l'm gonna get pregnant...

131
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,800
Miss Mizutani, are you
gonna have my child?

132
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,090
l'm gonna shoot it inside again.

133
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,520
You destroyed it...

134
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,360
l'm not gonna let this
woman have your child.

135
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,360
Yeah, you're right.

136
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,900
l'm gonna have your child.

137
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,240
Now, give me more...

138
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,890
l heard a gunshot...

139
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,460
Who are you?

140
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,350
l'm a hunter.

141
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,520
Haven't you heard?

142
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,420
l'm your partner, Angel.

143
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,390
l didn't know.

144
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,360
So we're in the same profession...

145
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,670
What are you doing here?

146
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,830
l'm here to take back a lost article.

147
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,850
That's terrible...

148
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,180
l can let you go, but they'll kill you.

149
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,890
There's rumors about that gun...

150
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,560
The one who possesses
the gun will go mad, right?

151
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,240
Hey, hunter.

152
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,740
Are you actually sane right now?

153
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,310
Who knows?

154
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,040
lf certain ideas are labled amoral
so society can repress them...

155
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,830
Then the parent and child might
have made the wrong choice.

156
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,780
Forget it.

157
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,480
What started it all
was an obvious truth.

158
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:22,520
After that, the choices were made
by no one other than the man himself.

159
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,230
But why does it always
have to be that gun?
