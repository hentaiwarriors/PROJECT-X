1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Naked Eyes 2

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,820
What a nice breeze, what a nice view.

3
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,400
This is the famous La Cress.

4
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,880
And that's Pennel's house.

5
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,220
I wish I could live in such a place.

6
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,080
Let's go, then.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,480
Pennel who was introduced by Yanburikos, set the delivery place as her home.

8
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,710
Pennel is a woman, but I received her order,

9
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,660
and drove a carriage to La Cress.

10
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,960
Because Pennel, a direct subordinate of Kremense, directed everyone in the country.

11
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,250
Her influence is the strongest in the country.

12
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,610
Also, she is a new selection committee member.

13
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,510
I had to entertain her and make her vote for Aria.

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,040
I don't know if Pennel is sane.

15
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,770
All her maids are trained by her.

16
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,060
I came to deliver the goods.

17
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,580
My name is Israndia.

18
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,420
It's a pleasure to hand it over directly to you.

19
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,590
Her name is Aria.

20
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,840
You have a good woman.

21
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,460
That's fine for greetings. Show it to me.

22
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,700
Okay.

23
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,950
Aria was uneasy until recently.

24
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,160
Aria knows,

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,810
how important this demonstration is for me.

26
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:33,740
Aria got rid of all her shame, and, even being oppressed from pleasure,

27
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,360
she must hold it back.

28
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,900
This is the item.

29
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,980
It's using a special spring so it can move inside as well.

30
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,240
Wait!

31
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,250
Such a good woman. Let me try it on her!

32
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,890
No, we have to test it first.

33
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,510
I can't let this woman touch Aria.

34
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,500
Let's begin.

35
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,970
Hey.

36
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,860
Not yet. Hold on.

37
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,150
Oh.

38
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,790
That's what is happening.

39
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,790
Please, enjoy it.

40
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,150
Please, this one is completely new.

41
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,870
No need for it.

42
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,320
I want to try it tonight.

43
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,600
Please.

44
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,690
Is there a time limit for a spring?

45
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,020
I understood what she's trying to say.

46
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,830
Even if it's moving long enough for Aria,

47
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,590
it's not long enough for overnight play.

48
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,120
That's fine.

49
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,200
I liked the introduction from that liar Yanburikos.

50
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,230
Do you want something else, apart from money?

51
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,630
I was holding on to my hot desire.

52
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,340
She liked my toy, but she's not pleased yet.

53
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,100
If not, please have this.

54
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,640
The unnecessary fan.

55
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,380
However, it seems she liked Aria, at least.

56
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,660
By the way.

57
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,460
I can give this to you. It might help you in some way.

58
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,400
Are you okay with it? I'm happy, my master!

59
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,940
I was unexpectedly shocked.

60
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,580
Is it because Aria received Pennel's fan?

61
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,020
No. The problem is, why I created Aria?

62
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,020
What made me create her?

63
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,180
Once, when I was wandering in an Eastern country,

64
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,960
a god's shrine maiden fell in love with me.

65
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,680
She abandoned her god and came to me.

66
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,820
I loved her too, but I was a mere traveler.

67
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,470
The farewell day came, and our love ended.

68
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,560
She abandoned her god, and I abandoned her, but...

69
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:54,380
But I guess she left a scar in my heart as revenge.

70
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,230
I guess her hatred made me fall in love.

71
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,660
Aria, wear this.

72
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,870
But then, what would happen with the ten years I spent on my revenge?

73
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,400
What would happen with my position as Aria's creator?

74
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,620
It's all the revenge of the Eastern woman.

75
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,070
Instigation of the abandoned god?

76
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,130
I tried to dress Aria in the Eastern clothes the woman gave me.

77
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,130
If Aria can dress alone...

78
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,100
Come in, master.

79
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,590
Aria? You managed to dress alone?

80
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:53,220
I was right. I created Aria, but in fact I was forced to.

81
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,170
I decided.

82
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,840
I had no right to use Aria as a tool for my revenge.

83
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,030
Aria, if you like it, you can wear it anytime.

84
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,540
I'm glad for your kindness.

85
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,640
But...I want...

86
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,490
Really?

87
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,820
I like how you want to be going far when I wear it.

88
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,400
Am I going far with you?

89
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,340
And you like it?

90
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,710
As if I'm not me anymore...

91
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,820
Aria...My Aria...

92
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,030
I'm very happy.

93
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,180
I see. That's good.

94
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,780
But...

95
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,290
I understand. I'll do anything for my master.

96
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,860
Aria.

97
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,850
Alchemical instruments are like springs.

98
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,270
You have to make it bigger to work longer.

99
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,700
But...

100
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,580
Impossible?

101
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,530
Yes, you'd break.

102
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,990
Me?

103
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,610
Yes, exactly.

104
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,980
Morning, Albert. Here.

105
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,620
What? Won't you eat?

106
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,530
Is it sick after yesterday's carriage travel?

107
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,470
It slept until the morning.

108
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,000
Hey, Albert!

109
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,980
Albedo, it's an important thing.

110
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,980
Wow, Albert is a genius!

111
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,820
Even I didn't know despite creating Albert.

112
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,270
From the evening till morning, Aria was happy.

113
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,380
I can't help but like Aria so much.

114
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,660
But... can I call this love?

115
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,380
Also, I have no time.

116
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,550
The selections are soon.

117
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,260
Yanburikos is mine, but Pennel is not certain.

118
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,830
Jack...I haven't started yet.

119
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,350
Is there time limit for a spring?

120
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,060
Yes. Even I will die someday.

121
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,620
Even I, as a creature living inside an hourglass.

122
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,360
Pennel's words have a hint.

123
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,970
Not everything is worth the struggle.

124
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,260
Yes, I better remove the hourglass.

125
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,580
Is Albert here?

126
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,320
Albert? What do you want at this time?

127
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,420
I'm sorry for the disturbance. Albert was supposed to sleep, but...

128
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,130
You can't find it.

129
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,290
Albert!

130
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,860
Albert!

131
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,960
Albert? Are you the Albert?

132
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,710
Albert?

133
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,430
What happened? You should not sleep in such places.

134
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,170
He's dead.

135
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,480
Eh?

136
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,340
Albert, wake up! Albert!

137
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,580
Aria, it's over.

138
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,240
But...

139
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,240
Aria said she wants to bury Albert in the backyard where they first met.

140
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,510
Goodbye, Albert.

141
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,610
But, why? Why? Why?

142
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,510
Aria, the sand ended.

143
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,560
Sand from Albert's hourglass.

144
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,740
Albert is an artificial creature I made before Aria.

145
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:15,360
I knew it had defects, so I could say it's normal it died before Aria.

146
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,810
Pennel sent a new order, as I thought.

147
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,660
Only 15 days left before the selections.

148
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,440
I have to persuade Pennel this time.

149
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,260
Okay.

150
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,220
We have chances. I'll need you to work, too.

151
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,960
Okay.

152
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,780
If Pennel asked about the fan, tell her it's stored with care.

153
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,300
It's underground, though.

154
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,700
Okay.

155
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,680
Why are you so sad?

156
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,630
I can help you with that.

157
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,420
It's Albert?!

158
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,840
Albert? Are you Albert?

159
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,170
What does it mean?

160
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,560
It's early for surprises.

161
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,900
Named Nigred; it is Albert's brother.

162
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,710
Nigred?

163
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,640
Oh, stop it, it tickles.

164
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,380
I said a wrong thing, despite trying to be careful.

165
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,930
This time it should be all right.

166
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,380
They won't die suddenly.

167
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,180
They are created and I can make as much as you want.

168
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,910
For you, Aria.

169
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,020
As much as you want.

170
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,280
Aria, wait!

171
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,100
Irreparable damage.

172
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:59,600
I understood how much I had hurt Aria.

173
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,700
I cannot fight without Aria.

174
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,040
Aria, please, understand,

175
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,860
you're my irreplaceable comrade.

176
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,820
Okay.

177
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,270
Aria, I'm entering.

178
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,260
Yes, Master...

179
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,260
Where are Albert and Nigred?

180
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
They're still sleeping.

181
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,850
What about making a pillow for them?

182
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,380
Yes, if it's your preference.

183
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,740
Don't stop that yet.

184
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,820
I know I'm an experimental doll created for your plan.

185
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,200
Yes, I created you for the battle.

186
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,410
I have to send you to Clemens on a mission.

187
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,700
And you must seduce the king.

188
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,530
This is our fate. Yours and mine.

189
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,050
Aria, I need you. Understand it.

190
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,900
Aria's eyes were saying,

191
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,060
he would create another me when I die.

192
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,420
Understand.

193
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,820
"Understand"?

194
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,620
I will obey your order.

195
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,610
Stop this nonsense!

196
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,590
Did I let Yanburikos touch you?

197
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,990
Did I allow that woman Pennel to have you?

198
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,210
You don't understand my feelings.

199
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,530
I'll show them your body.

200
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,950
Please get undressed.

201
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,020
Yes.

202
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,860
Lower your arms.

203
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,620
Raise your legs. Both of them.

204
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,410
Open them and show me inside.

205
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,100
Move them apart.

206
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,910
Your hands are not needed.

207
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,710
Open.

208
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,340
You can do this with your mind.

209
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,590
It should follow your thoughts. Try to close.

210
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,310
I...can't...

211
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,760
Think about something good.

212
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,110
Now open.

213
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,180
Invite a man by opening it wide.

214
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,820
Master...

215
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,980
What?

216
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,010
Please, insert yours, master...

217
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,170
Master, master!

218
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,590
After that, Aria befriended the new Albert and Nigred.

219
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,900
Yet, Aria still needs consoling.

220
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:43,440
Aria cannot get a grip on her feelings toward me,

221
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:49,810
but it must irritate her that I know her better than herself.

222
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,790
Aria doesn't know her power, Dora.

223
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,620
That she can seduce the king Cremens.

224
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,440
Her heart is sometimes open to me, sometimes not.

225
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,020
Is the lighting good?

226
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,910
Yes.

227
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,970
Please, start.

228
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,910
What is it?

229
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,100
A small electrical current.

230
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,680
What? That's electricity?

231
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,810
When it works, metal becomes a magnet.

232
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,810
The new item uses this power instead of springs.

233
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,900
It's not magic?

234
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,920
Yes, it's an alchemical invention. Let's begin, then.

235
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,740
Pennel likes immorality and cruelty.

236
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,390
One of her words gave me god's revelation.

237
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,910
A pure item made from indecent things.

238
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,390
Let's think somebody would use this current.

239
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,300
Small pieces in their bodies react to electricity,

240
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,720
and send various impulses in them.

241
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,340
Are you feeling good?

242
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,060
Yes, Pennel-sama!

243
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,970
Very much so.

244
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,550
They are enjoying, you saw?!

245
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,220
More power.

246
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,660
It's a nice start, so...

247
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,540
Oh, just add power.

248
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,530
Oh, that's nice, that's nice.

249
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,710
Do you like it?

250
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,220
Crap.

251
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,920
What does it mean? It's useless.

252
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:01,090
No, they just haven't used it before. They need training.

253
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,800
Training? Are you sure?

254
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,840
Please, wait. Aria.

255
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,830
She is holding it in for now.

256
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,060
What? In the front?!

257
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,080
More power, more!

258
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,540
Crap, it can break Aria.

259
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,260
Aria...Is it ok?

260
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,160
Aria, you can do it. Imagine this pleasure.

261
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,480
Yes, it's going inside.

262
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,810
Good job, good job.

263
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,620
I understand, it's okay, it's nice.

264
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,440
Pennel agreed at the last.

265
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,740
Pennel promised me she will vote for Aria.

266
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,400
Aria did a great job.

267
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:24,340
After all, Aria is the only partner for me.

268
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,300
THE END
