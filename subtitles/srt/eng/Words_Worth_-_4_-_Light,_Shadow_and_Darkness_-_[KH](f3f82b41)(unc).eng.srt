1
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:32,940
Must be this way.

2
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:50,051
The passage is sealed. This must be it.

3
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:54,393
The crystal key.

4
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,593
<i>What's going on?</i>

5
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:07,278
<i>Mystral Window!</i>

6
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:14,147
<i>Who was that girl? She looked like Mew.</i>

7
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,416
What happened in my past?

8
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:19,923
<i>Who's there?</i>

9
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,164
<i>l've been waiting for you, Pollux.</i>

10
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:03,392
Who are you?

11
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:08,099
Your guide to the Land of Darkness.

12
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,305
The Land of Darkness?

13
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,972
<i>What are you doing?
Don't be afraid.</i>

14
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,081
Cutie boy.

15
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,551
<i>No, don't....</i>

16
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,343
Pollux.

17
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:49,306
Come over. Here, inside me.

18
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,362
<i>That's it.</i>

19
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:14,372
<i>You're so good.</i>

20
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:16,639
Right there.

21
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:19,772
lncredible.

22
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:40,124
What the heck...?

23
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,085
<i>l can't wait anymore.</i>

24
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:11,561
So good. More, more.

25
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:19,561
<i>Amazing. What is it, why here?</i>

26
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,838
So good. Harder, harder.

27
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,744
Do it hard, tear me apart.

28
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:30,779
More, more, pump harder.

29
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:41,686
So good. Much harder.

30
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:50,629
<i>So good. Pollux's sword
is powerful and incredible.</i>

31
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,435
<i>l'm coming.</i>

32
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,015
Good, so good, Pollux.

33
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,656
Damn! l was so close!

34
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:18,186
Damn this monster!

35
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,159
<i>l won't let you get away!</i>

36
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:31,875
Damn!

37
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:36,274
<i>l can't think clearly. Thank you.
That was a close call.</i>

38
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:39,079
ls that monster
from the Tribe of Shadows?

39
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:42,087
No. She said something about
the Land of Darkness.

40
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:44,652
The Land of Darkness? What is that?

41
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:48,657
Hey! Put on some clothes!
Sorry.

42
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:51,621
<i>lt doesn't make sense.</i>

43
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:56,665
Could there be a land
other than Light and Shadows?

44
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,603
Well, anyway.

45
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,634
<i>l'm Rita. Are you the famous Pollux?</i>

46
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,503
Now that you mention it,
you do look like that statue.

47
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,979
By the way, what are you doing here?

48
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,380
What?

49
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:13,416
<i>l'm a Swordswoman of Light.</i>

50
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,647
l figure, if l follow you,
l might win some fame.

51
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,831
What was that earthquake?

52
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:06,562
There will be a war again.

53
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,500
What?

54
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:17,882
<i>That child can't be
a mix of Light and Shadows.</i>

55
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:20,745
Either way, we have to do something.

56
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:33,392
ls this it?

57
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:36,765
ls this the Passage that connects
the Lands of Light and Shadows?

58
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:39,168
Looks like it.
Shall we?

59
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,866
<i>Hold on a sec. l'll report this to Sir Fabris.</i>

60
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:55,482
<i>Let's go.
Yeah.</i>

61
00:07:57,957 --> 00:08:01,393
<i>What's wrong?
l'm trembling with excitement.</i>

62
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,505
A war again.

63
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:21,173
Sir Pollux.

64
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,912
What? The passage is cleared?

65
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:33,288
Yes, sir! Miss Rita
has just sent us a report.

66
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:37,184
She says Sir Pollux
broke the Seal of the Passage.

67
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:41,926
<i>Pollux did....</i>

68
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:49,598
This is the time for a showdown!
Round up the entire army!

69
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:52,509
We will attack the Land of Shadows
once and for all!

70
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,430
<i>Who's there? A swordsman of Light?</i>

71
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:25,841
<i>We won't let you step
into the Land of Shadows!</i>

72
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:02,541
Have l fought in this place before?

73
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:12,989
<i>Finally, they're here!</i>

74
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:17,696
Damn the Tribe of Light!
l shall kill them all once and for all!

75
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:20,164
Everybody, we shall attack them!

76
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,874
Sharon! l have to talk to you.

77
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,814
<i>l can't wait anymore.</i>

78
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:48,987
When this battle is over, l will
talk to Sir Wartoshika about you and me.

79
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,364
Caesar, you are a good man.

80
00:10:56,936 --> 00:11:00,372
<i>But l still don't feel it.</i>

81
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:04,035
Are you still in love with Astral?

82
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:06,743
That bastard died 20 years ago!

83
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,270
Caesar.

84
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,851
<i>l just can't forget that day when...</i>

85
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,454
...that weak and indecisive Astral
came to save my life.

86
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:21,825
<i>Sharon!
Astral! Stay away!</i>

87
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:25,289
<i>l don't want to believe he's dead.</i>

88
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:27,823
<i>l'm sorry, Caesar.</i>

89
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:34,205
Astral died. Forget him, Sharon.

90
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:38,942
Attack!

91
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:43,647
Fire!

92
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:50,014
Attack!

93
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:07,403
Damn, they have sentinels.

94
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:11,765
l think that hole will lead us
into the Underground Castle.

95
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:22,052
<i>This way we won't waste our time
in battle to sneak into their headquarters.</i>

96
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,457
<i>You're not only a great swordsman,
but smart, too.</i>

97
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:27,584
But how come you knew about this?

98
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:32,821
l have a vague memory of
wandering around here a long time ago.

99
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:36,892
<i>That's weird.
Nobody could get in here for 20 years.</i>

100
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:38,561
l know that.

101
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:41,505
<i>But l don't remember anything
about 20 years ago.</i>

102
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:44,941
<i>That's such a long time ago
even l don't remember anything.</i>

103
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,501
<i>Let's go!</i>

104
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,789
Sharon, this is bad.

105
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:07,727
<i>Let's fall back to the West Gate
and regroup.</i>

106
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:10,496
Agreed! We know the geography better.

107
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,198
We can fight back once we get back there.

108
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:15,263
Listen, everybody!

109
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,135
<i>We'll need to buy time to regroup.</i>

110
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:21,544
<i>Once we've all crossed the chasm,
we'll blow up the bridge!</i>

111
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:22,945
<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

112
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:27,380
How long is this air duct?

113
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,546
l have no idea.

114
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:33,723
This is so tiring. Hey, is that the exit?

115
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:36,758
lt looks bright.

116
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:39,593
<i>l don't think that's it.</i>

117
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:52,442
Oops! Shit!

118
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,907
Pervert! What are you doing?

119
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:59,611
<i>l'm sorry. You just stopped so suddenly.</i>

120
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,946
<i>What's wrong?
Look.</i>

121
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:04,312
<i>This is bad. Let's go back.</i>

122
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,564
The explosives are ready.

123
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:18,736
<i>Good. Let's blow it up now!
Yes, sir!</i>

124
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:37,054
Soldier of Light!
The air duct!

125
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:39,852
<i>They're coming in through the air duct!
Fire into it!</i>

126
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,294
Oh, no!

127
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,903
This way! This way!

128
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:59,041
<i>He's fleeing! Capture him!</i>

129
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,875
<i>We'll get you!</i>

130
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:07,349
<i>He can't be....</i>

131
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:11,887
l see.

132
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:14,557
<i>So they've pushed us back
to the West Gate.</i>

133
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:15,559
Yes, sir.

134
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:18,921
Sir Wartoshika, where to?

135
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:21,626
<i>Don't follow me. l want to be alone.</i>

136
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:27,666
<i>You're done reporting,
go back to the battlefield!</i>

137
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,900
Yes, sir!

138
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:30,798
Dimwit.

139
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:59,700
l lose him around here every time.

140
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:08,339
Now l see.

141
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:18,089
Oh, no!

142
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:23,321
Well done.

143
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:41,845
Damn Wartoshika, how far is he going?

144
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:57,652
This is bad.

145
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,893
<i>Soon he'll complete
the Words Worth Tablet.</i>

146
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,025
This is bad.

147
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:05,601
l have to call back Menza right away.

148
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:30,484
Oh, my, l got separated from Pollux.

149
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:36,201
What can l do now?
Who are you?

150
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:41,870
Are you of the Tribe of Shadows?

151
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:45,468
<i>l'm Wartoshika,
the King of the Tribe of Shadows.</i>

152
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:48,245
<i>Oh, that's....</i>

153
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:53,274
<i>That means l'm lucky.
l'll defeat you and l'll be a hero.</i>

154
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,857
How brave of you.
But would it be so easy?

155
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:02,317
Come on!

156
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,830
What happened to your earlier bravery?

157
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,867
<i>l'm coming to you now!</i>

158
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:17,237
Shit! Shit! Shit!

159
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:21,471
Shit!

160
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:27,684
<i>What's up? ls that it?</i>

161
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:33,952
Shit!

162
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:43,224
Go ahead! Kill me now!

163
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:46,169
No regrets now to be killed
by the King of Shadows!

164
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:48,468
What a noble woman.

165
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:51,505
Too bad you are a Swordswoman of Light.

166
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,747
<i>What're you doing?</i>

167
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,920
You are so brave.

168
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:04,553
You will bear fine children.

169
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:06,790
What?

170
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:12,587
Now that Astral has disappeared...

171
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:18,235
...l have no choice but to mate with you...

172
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:21,364
...and produce
the One Who Mixes Light and Shadows...

173
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
<i>...since you're from the Tribe of Light.</i>

174
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,374
What are you mumbling about?

175
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:29,505
<i>Don't! Just because l'm a woman....</i>

176
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,747
Stop!

177
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:34,274
<i>Don't!</i>

178
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:42,053
l am a Swordswoman of Light!
l have no use for a man!

179
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,571
<i>Stop. l don't....</i>

180
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:01,674
<i>Not there....</i>

181
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:03,713
<i>No....</i>

182
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,786
lt feels good.

183
00:20:36,282 --> 00:20:37,749
Stop it.

184
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:56,633
<i>l'm going crazy.</i>

185
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,697
Good. lt feels so good.

186
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:21,352
<i>l'm scared. lt's so big.
You'll tear me apart.</i>

187
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:23,454
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

188
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,390
<i>Now that you're this wet.</i>

189
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,532
lt hurts!

190
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:37,264
lt hurts!

191
00:21:37,977 --> 00:21:39,638
No, it hurts!

192
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:43,204
Bear with me. Relax a little.

193
00:21:46,885 --> 00:21:50,446
lt hurts! No! Please stop!

194
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:54,559
You are hurting me!

195
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:04,335
lf you do this to me...

196
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:08,067
<i>...l can't go back to the Land of Light.</i>

197
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,938
Then you can stay here forever.

198
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:19,113
lt hurts, please stop!

199
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,751
Do we have to do more?

200
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:31,992
More and more, until you bear the child,
a mix of Light and Shadows.

201
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:37,999
<i>You're tearing me apart.</i>

202
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:42,833
<i>l'm hot.</i>

203
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:47,971
So hot.

204
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:54,580
Hot.

205
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,380
lt hurts.

206
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:06,253
<i>l'm so hot.</i>

207
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:09,662
lt feels good.

208
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:14,838
<i>My body's going weird.</i>

209
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:24,015
So good.

210
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:29,954
<i>l'm coming, Sir Wartoshika!</i>

211
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:59,246
Look at the Words Worth Tablet.

212
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:04,018
ls this it? l heard
it was smashed into pieces.

213
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:07,757
l have picked up the fragments
and reconstructed it this far.

214
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:10,960
The tradition says this:

215
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:15,022
<i>''lf you read this Tablet,
you will understand everything.</i>

216
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:21,164
<i>''But it can be read only by
One Who Mixes Light and Shadows.</i>

217
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:25,275
<i>''And this one shall bring on a New World.''</i>

218
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:27,702
One Who Mixes Light and Shadows.

219
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,983
<i>Exactly! Therefore....
We can't allow that to happen.</i>

220
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:35,548
Tessio?
Menza?

221
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:42,759
How come the Commander
of the Tribe of Light is here?

222
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,090
What?

223
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:46,321
<i>l'll show you why!</i>

224
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:49,632
Damn monster!

225
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:52,730
Die, Wartoshika!

226
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:06,851
<i>l never imagined there'd be one
so skilled among the Swordsmen of Light.</i>

227
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:10,645
But this is it!

228
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:14,987
<i>That sword....</i>

229
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,891
Sharon!

230
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:42,547
Sharon!
