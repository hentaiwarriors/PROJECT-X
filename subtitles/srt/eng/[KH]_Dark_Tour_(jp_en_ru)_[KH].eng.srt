1
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:43,820
DARK TOUR

2
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,880
BORABORA... AUSTRALIA-NEWZEALAND...
DEVIL PRINCESS TOUR

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,200
Matsumura is recuperating for a month.

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,570
Isn't he responsible for the Devil Princess Worship Tour?

5
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,710
What? Who's going to take his place?

6
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,540
That tour is coming up soon.
It's fully booked.

7
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,750
Um...

8
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,150
This should do...

9
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,420
Hey, Ann Naka!

10
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,320
You want to go?

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,680
Please don't kid me.

12
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,460
I heard ghosts really appear in the Devil Princess Worship Tour in Matsuzawa Village.

13
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,000
That story is a hoax.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,700
The people in Matsuzawa Village came up with it to attract tourists.

15
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,690
But I can't handle scary things...

16
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,210
Too bad, Ann Naka. Your the tour guide.

17
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,680
What?

18
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,040
Reference material. Go over it.

19
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,580
DEVIL PRINCESS WORSHIP TOUR

20
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,680
Oh.

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,410
Isn't this is your first tour guide job?

22
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,720
Show some spirit!

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,340
"Show some spirit."

24
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,190
That's right.

25
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,440
I always wanted to be a tour guide.

26
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,630
Yes. I'll do it!

27
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,490
They're late.

28
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,980
Hey! Aren't we leaving?

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,660
Yes. Please wait a little while.

30
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,160
Is this the manager?

31
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,730
This is Ann Naka. Um...

32
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,170
I was just about to call you.

33
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,140
Those three groups have cancelled.

34
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,380
What?

35
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,610
Go with the remaining customers.

36
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,110
But...

37
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,680
It's less pressure for your first time.
It's better this way.

38
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,650
Well, okay.

39
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,740
This is a JSC promoted...

40
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:59,220
This is a JSC promoted Devil Princess Worship Tour. Thank you for participating.

41
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,250
Wow! Two girls! You're really brave.

42
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,690
Yeah. It seemed like fun.

43
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,000
Listen to you! You said it was going to be cool.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,500
But it's a mystery tour! Uncool.

45
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
You can cling to me anytime you're scared.

46
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,900
What? No way!

47
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,640
What a horny dude.

48
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,110
We get off the bus at the entrance of Matsuzawa Village and proceed on foot to the hotel.

49
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,250
You shouldn't have applied for this tour.

50
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,880
You know I'm paranormal.

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,260
Why not?

52
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,390
Let's do it while ghosts watch us.
It's a turn on.

53
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,600
Let's have a real good time.

54
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,570
When we arrive, it's free time.
Then dinner...

55
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,440
Nevermind.

56
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,580
What?

57
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,880
Was it Ann Naka-san?

58
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,050
No one is listening. Why don't you take a break?

59
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,980
Yes, but...

60
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,390
Go ahead.

61
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,010
Yes.

62
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,960
Well then, just a little bit.

63
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,530
The usual tour guide had an accident?

64
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,130
Yes.

65
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,640
Could it be the curse of Tamiko?

66
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,140
Curse? Isn't the story a hoax?

67
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,950
I'm interested in the Devil Princess legend.

68
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,780
I've been on this tour numerous times.

69
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,390
Tamiko really existed. It's the truth.

70
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,620
The truth?

71
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,150
Yes. Matsuzawa Village always had few women.

72
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:54,060
To satisfy the desires of the men, women from neighboring villages were sold there.

73
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,100
One was Tamiko.

74
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,130
The main character in the Devil Princess legend.

75
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,710
The men of Matsuzawa Village
put Tamiko on a pedestal like a Princess,

76
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,670
and exploded their desires.

77
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,220
No!

78
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,810
Tamiko, who was sold to cover debts,

79
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,870
had no choice but to accept their desires.

80
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,620
But then appeared a man who was kind to her.

81
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,700
Tamiko loved this man and conceived a child.

82
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,170
The two tried to elope from the village.

83
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,070
But...

84
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,650
their plan was foiled and the man was killed.

85
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,310
Tamiko was violently raped on the spot.

86
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,260
And then...

87
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,180
She miscarried the child in her.

88
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,210
What?

89
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,950
That's horrible. That's too horrible!

90
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,920
That's too pitiful for Tamiko!

91
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,090
Ann Naka-san, you're kind.

92
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,190
What?

93
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,420
Well, what do you think happened after that?

94
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,470
She couldn't be with the man she loved
and she became a devil.

95
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,970
One after the other, she killed the men that raped her.

96
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,210
During sex, their nails shattered.

97
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,480
Their eyeballs popped out.

98
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,210
Maggots came out of their intestines.

99
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,710
No!

100
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,480
That's the legend of Tamiko's Devil Princess.

101
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,090
There is a doll in the room where Tamiko lived.

102
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,220
At night it...

103
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,210
Please. No more.

104
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,070
Let's go home.

105
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,240
What are you talking about?
We've come this far.

106
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,510
MATSUZAWA VILLAGE

107
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,240
Please pick us up tomorrow at three o'clock.

108
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,010
Thank you very much.

109
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,250
There it goes.

110
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,650
There's no way out.

111
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,880
Let's go. Follow me.

112
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,310
DEVIL PRINCESS INN

113
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,310
Welcome

114
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,940
I'm Sakamoto, the proprietor.

115
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,210
Please come this way.

116
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,190
I can't. There are ghosts here.

117
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,420
They're definitely here!

118
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,650
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,190
What's the matter?

120
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,100
He's not the usual innkeeper.

121
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,220
What?

122
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,470
Your rooms are on the second floor.

123
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,470
Please relax until dinner time.

124
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,010
What? Where's Tamiko's room?

125
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,310
That's after dinner and a visit to the cemetary.

126
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,440
What?

127
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,260
Ms. Tour Guide...
Yes?

128
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,720
Want to come to our room?

129
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,090
Let's play Mah Jong. You know how?

130
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,460
Oh, no. I...

131
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,470
All you do is hang with that intellectual. I'm going to sulk.

132
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,470
By intellectual, do you mean Saito-san?

133
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,210
Yes. We're all customers so treat us as equals. Alright?

134
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,720
This is paradise!

135
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,460
The fun is just starting.

136
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,520
What, Tamiko again?

137
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,210
More than that, aren't they bigger?

138
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,000
Hey what... Knock it off.

139
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,060
I'm getting out.

140
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,060
"All I do is hang with Saito-san..."

141
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,980
I didn't mean to. Being a tour guide is complicated.

142
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,600
Sorry. We haven't discussed business.

143
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,550
Oh sorry. I forgot.

144
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,240
Could you wait outside until I change?

145
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,260
Yes, of course. Well, then.

146
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,620
Let's see. Which was Tamiko's room?

147
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,780
Let's stick with the program.

148
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,650
Let's wait until then.

149
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,920
We came all the way here. You can't get this thrill anywhere else.

150
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,100
If only Kuroki-san was with us.

151
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,070
"You can cling to me anytime you're scared." Right.

152
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,760
He's not here when it counts.

153
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,640
Good evening.

154
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,270
Tamiko-san, are you here?

155
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,110
Stop it. It's not funny.

156
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,390
Rice and candles.

157
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,020
It's just to create a mood.

158
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,490
Hey, look at that!

159
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,490
It was in the brochure.

160
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,720
Isn't it the doll with Tamiko's curse?

161
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,740
Let's take a picture with the doll.

162
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,930
No way! That's not funny!

163
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,720
Hey, come on. Let's go to Tamiko's room.

164
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,560
I don't want to. Somebody's been watching us.

165
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,790
I can feel it.

166
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,200
"Feel it"? Cool. Like how?

167
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,300
Like this?

168
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,170
Or like this?

169
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,110
Useless!

170
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,170
Where are you going?

171
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,450
That's harsh!

172
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,400
What's with that guy?

173
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,370
So undependable.

174
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,900
I don't believe it.

175
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,410
Shit! That voice. It's that bothersome chick.

176
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,780
She might call someone.

177
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,800
Let's get this over with.

178
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,530
She's all wet.

179
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,300
This one's firm and pointy.

180
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,710
Are they getting off on each other?

181
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,870
Yeah! Get off on each other!

182
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,360
Alright. We go as scheduled.

183
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,230
It's terrible!

184
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,410
Hayashi-san, what happened?

185
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,440
Hands came out and there were screams!

186
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,880
From Tamiko's room!

187
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,250
Tamiko's room?

188
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,420
What are you surprised about?
This is Tamiko's house.

189
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,920
Nothing should surprise you.

190
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,830
The Devil Princess is watching you.

191
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,120
It was so sudden.

192
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,770
But I haven't been this thrilled in a long time! I love it!

193
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,900
Where are the others?

194
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,180
Katahiro-san and Hayashi-san want to eat in their own room.

195
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,490
How selfish. What about the girls?

196
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,390
It looks like they went into town.
That's what Sakamoto-san said.

197
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,460
They went down the mountain?

198
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,160
They shouldn't. It's dangerous at night.

199
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,740
Ann Naka-san, are they making fun of you?

200
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,730
What?

201
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,540
You're still a novice.

202
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,740
Thanks for dinner.

203
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,660
Don't worry. Selfish customers are at their own fault.

204
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,990
Rina-chan, you are doing a good job.

205
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,730
Who are you calling Rina-chan?

206
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,000
Please don't treat me like a child.

207
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,460
No. I didn't mean it like that.

208
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,320
Inoue-san and the others haven't returned.

209
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,050
I guess I'm a failure as a tour guide.

210
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,190
It's me.
Me.

211
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,990
Rina-chan looks depressed.

212
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,760
I thought I'd surprise you.

213
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,600
You called me Rina-chan again.

214
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,160
Oh. That's right. Sorry.

215
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,540
That's alright. I forgive you.

216
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,550
Rina is a nice name.

217
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:00,050
Anna Karina. There's a French actress by that name.

218
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:05,090
Anna Karina is in a lot of Godard's movies.

219
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,720
You know a lot about movies.

220
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,830
Yeah. I dream about making a serious horror movie.

221
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,130
What about Rina-chan?

222
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,670
Me?

223
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,830
Why did you become a tour guide?

224
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,470
Because I like to travel.

225
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,940
Going to different places, meeting different people,

226
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,310
and to make that my job.

227
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,410
That's wonderful.

228
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,580
But maybe I should have kept it a hobby.

229
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,850
Rina-chan...

230
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,290
Don't think that way.

231
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,890
Everything starts with what you love.

232
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,580
Saito-san...

233
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,090
Okay. Here's the main course.

234
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,630
I don't want to.

235
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,500
I'm sorry. Inoue-san hasn't returned.

236
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,270
Waiting is a waste of time.

237
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,510
Let's just go.

238
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,770
But...

239
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,010
That's right. If we don't worship, we're cursed.

240
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:07,020
Don't worry. When the two return, I'll bring them.

241
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,920
Alright. Then I'll leave it to you.

242
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,170
It's at the end of the tunnel.

243
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,580
I can feel ghosts.

244
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,340
I feel it too!

245
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,650
Oh, no. Is this part of the tour?

246
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,920
No, it's not!

247
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,060
Hey! What's that?

248
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,500
I can't take it anymore!

249
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,860
Tomoya!

250
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,560
Please wait!

251
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,800
Rina-chan!

252
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,510
You're in the way.

253
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,630
It's Tamiko.

254
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,500
It's Tamiko!

255
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,420
Tamiya!

256
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,900
Katahiro-san? Hayashi-san?

257
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,400
No good. I lost them.

258
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,840
Maybe they're back at the inn.
I'll go back.

259
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,150
You're a real horny chick.

260
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,310
Even though you said "no" in the beginning.

261
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,850
Take another rod.

262
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,780
Katahiro-san? Hayashi-san?

263
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,480
Kuroki-san, you're back?

264
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,360
We're alone at last.

265
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,590
What?

266
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,230
No!

267
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,220
Please stop!

268
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,190
What's with you guys? Don't come back.

269
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,310
You can't have her to yourself, Kuroki.

270
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,440
What's going on?

271
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,510
We belong to this village.

272
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,450
No!

273
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,520
No! Please stop!

274
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,960
This village was always short on women.

275
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,340
We were bored everyday.

276
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:27,740
So Sakamoto-san, the new mayor...

277
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,930
made a plan to snare women with this tour.

278
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,150
No!

279
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,020
It wasn't easy.

280
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,370
Making false reservations.

281
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,410
Hospitalizing a male tour guide.

282
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:56,280
It's better to have a female tour guide, right?

283
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,390
A cute one like Ann Naka-san.

284
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,210
No!

285
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,270
A weird guy sure got in the way.

286
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,050
I've been after you from the beginning.

287
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,050
No. Don't.

288
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,120
Stop it. Please.

289
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,750
Stop it!

290
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,120
What?

291
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,920
Rina-chan?

292
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,210
This is your favorite tour guide.

293
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,280
She's a nasty one.

294
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,720
Stop it! This is a crime!

295
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,380
A crime? This?

296
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,570
Rina-chan...

297
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,270
I want it in my mouth.

298
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,300
No choice.

299
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,430
Here.

300
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,240
This is her real identity.

301
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,410
Hey. I haven't cum yet.

302
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,190
This woman is great!

303
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,920
You're so tight!

304
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,660
What happened?

305
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,320
Don't tell me she's...

306
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,090
Hey! The doll!

307
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,470
Rina-chan.

308
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,740
Tamiko!
