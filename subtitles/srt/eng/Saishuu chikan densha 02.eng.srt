1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,570
Now.

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,806
So I don't have to work
for a public rail company...

3
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:10,544
...my idea to create a Sleazy
Train to increase revenues...

4
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:15,848
...and keep my railroad company from
going out of business is working.

5
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:27,455
Today, I am on a scouting mission to find
girls who can fulfill our passengers' needs.

6
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:42,070
Hey, what are you doing?

7
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:50,050
We're getting off!

8
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:50,644
What?

9
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:09,265
Midnight Sleazy Train

10
00:01:14,545 --> 00:01:16,479
What are we doing?

11
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,882
We're almost at my stop.

12
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:23,820
My fingers lost control.

13
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:25,816
I can't believe you screamed.

14
00:01:26,056 --> 00:01:28,854
Why are you doing this to me?

15
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:31,592
Why?

16
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:33,491
I'm a pervert.

17
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:36,327
I was trying to make you
mine by giving you pleasure.

18
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:38,892
I was sure about you...

19
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:40,334
I guess my intuition was off.

20
00:01:40,704 --> 00:01:43,764
I guess I'm going to have
to force you to do as I say.

21
00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:46,472
What is a pervert?

22
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:47,067
What?

23
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:50,245
Anyway, that thing you
did really woke me up.

24
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:51,747
Will you do it again?

25
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:56,586
I'm always getting in trouble
at school for daydreaming.

26
00:01:57,888 --> 00:01:59,480
I see.

27
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:03,718
Let's go to your house and
I will do it to you, lots.

28
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:05,852
But I'll miss school.

29
00:02:06,263 --> 00:02:09,858
Don't worry, you'll learn other things.

30
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:29,079
This feels so good.

31
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,446
I didn't know anything about this.

32
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:35,457
I could get addicted.

33
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:40,929
I can't believe she knows nothing
about sex, in this day and age.

34
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:45,629
But she'd be perfect
for the Sleazy Train.

35
00:02:57,414 --> 00:02:58,540
She came.

36
00:03:00,818 --> 00:03:02,786
Remember this...

37
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:07,954
...when you are with a man, you
have to let him watch you masturbate.

38
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:09,522
I do?

39
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:13,320
That's the most basic
courtesy as a woman.

40
00:03:13,797 --> 00:03:14,661
Look down.

41
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:19,668
What is that?

42
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,238
You just felt good, right?

43
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:24,636
But that's not enough.

44
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:29,875
If you don't let the man feel
the same thing, it would be rude.

45
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:32,848
Do you know what you're supposed to do?

46
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:35,677
I just play with it, right?

47
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,719
That's the basics.

48
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:40,883
Practical experience is
the best way to learn.

49
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:45,317
First, grab it, then lick it.

50
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:47,621
I see.

51
00:03:54,872 --> 00:03:57,932
Try more than just licking that part...

52
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,336
...use your imagination
and try different things.

53
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:14,524
That's unusual.

54
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:17,653
But it's pretty good.

55
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:23,400
That's the basic move.

56
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,393
Keep going faster.

57
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:43,610
Something came out.

58
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:46,352
That's proof that the man came.

59
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:49,856
That is grown up communication.

60
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:55,128
It would be very rude not to
give it your full attention.

61
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,130
Do you understand?

62
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:58,490
I do.

63
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,859
Swallow.

64
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:06,442
It tastes funny.

65
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,701
What are you saying?

66
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:11,144
It's the best thing
for a woman's beauty.

67
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:14,747
Besides, most men love
it when you swallow.

68
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:17,119
Then I will have some more.

69
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:24,589
Look, there's some here too.

70
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:35,770
You're doing very well.

71
00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:37,601
You're an excellent student.

72
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:41,168
As a reward, I will lick you.

73
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,202
Really?

74
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:45,140
Yeah.

75
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:46,443
Lie down.

76
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:47,208
Okay.

77
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:14,639
That feels so good.

78
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,674
It's almost like you wet yourself.

79
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,319
I didn't pee.

80
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:28,115
It's sliding in and out.

81
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:29,886
Does it hurt?

82
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,388
No, it feels really good.

83
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:35,029
Good.

84
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:37,498
Then let's put something
better than a finger in.

85
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:43,231
We're going to put this in.

86
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:47,065
What's the matter?

87
00:06:47,177 --> 00:06:49,077
Only the tip is in.

88
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:50,306
Does it hurt?

89
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,871
No, it's way better than the other one.

90
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:54,917
Hurry up and put in more.

91
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:57,877
Is this really her first time?

92
00:06:58,255 --> 00:06:59,244
Who cares.

93
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,352
All right.

94
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:07,855
More, do it more.

95
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,897
She is usable.

96
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:14,729
It's too bad we can't
market her virginity.

97
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,629
Hey, Amano.

98
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:43,996
So, how did things work out today?

99
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:45,830
What is it?

100
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:47,564
The weekend results are out.

101
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:48,193
Look.

102
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:50,765
Sales are up 30%.

103
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:55,433
So at this rate escaping
bankruptcy is only a matter of time.

104
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,876
It's not going to be that simple.

105
00:07:57,948 --> 00:07:59,472
What's going to happen if we get caught?

106
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:02,178
It's going to increase company profits.

107
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:05,719
Even if we get caught, if we
explain they'll understand.

108
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,483
You're so naпve.

109
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,223
A company has its image to think of.

110
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,625
Even if it makes money, what we're
doing is socially unacceptable.

111
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:16,094
So what are you saying we should do?

112
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,761
It's not our responsibility
to think of a solution.

113
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:22,568
We're just employees.

114
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,675
So Makoto, you don't care what
happens to the town of Momokawa?

115
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:29,640
That's not what I'm saying.

116
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:32,415
I grew up there too.

117
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:35,349
Then how can you say
something like that?

118
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,044
What!

119
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,086
Hey, hey.

120
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:39,745
We're all on the same side,
there's no need to fight.

121
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,749
Excuse me.

122
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,993
Can I help you?

123
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:48,990
I see that you're busy, but can
I have a moment of your time?

124
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:52,026
Freelance journalist, Yuka Ootori.

125
00:08:52,102 --> 00:08:53,535
Are you on assignment?

126
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,434
Yes!

127
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:59,875
I heard that some unspeakable things
were taking place on your train.

128
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:00,671
Something called...

129
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,003
...the Sleazy Train!

130
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,675
As a journalist, I've come to check
out the truth about this matter.

131
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:11,277
Can you tell me, do you
know anything about this?

132
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:14,246
We have no idea what
you're talking about.

133
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:27,363
We managed to fool her, but she
plans to investigate headquarters.

134
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:32,240
I told you there was no way
the Sleazy Train would work.

135
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:35,607
It's all because of your stupid idea.

136
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,509
What?

137
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,742
This is strange.

138
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:44,920
There is no way the Momokawa line's
revenue should increase so drastically.

139
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:48,719
They know it wouldn't do any
good to submit falsified reports.

140
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:51,725
If this is true, then why?

141
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:56,228
Why don't you stop
attacking me and help me out.

142
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:56,890
What?

143
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,902
If the line goes out of
business, we're fired anyway.

144
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:02,872
Our only option is to
continue the Sleazy Train.

145
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:04,600
You don't get it!

146
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,170
I told you!

147
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:11,214
Will you listen?

148
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:15,311
This is an important
matter for your company.

149
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:18,115
Of course there's no such
thing as the Sleazy Train.

150
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:21,281
I think you watch too much porn.

151
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:24,525
How dare you!

152
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:28,189
Fine, I'm not going to
get anywhere with you.

153
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:30,630
Let me talk to someone
who will take me seriously.

154
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:32,393
You're a pain in the ass!

155
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:34,528
You're interrupting my
work, get out of here!

156
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:38,868
If I ever see you here
again, I'm calling the police!

157
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,605
The police!

158
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:44,641
You're the ones who don't
want the police involved!

159
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:49,116
I need proof.

160
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:54,120
Sleazy Train...

161
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:58,925
If you don't agree, you should quit.

162
00:10:58,995 --> 00:10:59,654
What!

163
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,492
Hey!

164
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:02,196
I said cut it out!

165
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:02,856
Inoue!

166
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,557
There's nothing we can do.

167
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:06,100
All we can do is help him.

168
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:06,999
But...

169
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:09,900
I see.

170
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:18,203
Tetsuo!

171
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:19,277
Sana!

172
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:21,277
Are you just getting home?

173
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:22,578
Yeah, and you?

174
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:25,484
I'm going to take my dad some dinner.

175
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:27,519
He's working late again today.

176
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:29,355
That's hard.

177
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:33,658
It seems like he's giving his
life to finding a hot spring.

178
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:35,393
Yeah, I know.

179
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,763
Everyone thinks my dad's crazy.

180
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:41,068
But I believe in him, so I don't care.

181
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:43,468
Sana, I'm sorry, I...

182
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:46,870
I think it's wonderful to
believe in something so strongly.

183
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,778
And I love my dad.

184
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,018
And I love you too, because you are so
dedicated to your work at the railroad.

185
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:56,776
Huh?

186
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:01,422
Um, uh...

187
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:04,794
I mean that I love you
as a lifelong friend.

188
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:08,791
...not in a sexual or romantic way.

189
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:14,262
I know I'm like a little sister to
you, so I know you know what I mean.

190
00:12:15,772 --> 00:12:16,898
Anyway...

191
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:19,271
My dad is waiting so I better get going.

192
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:20,273
See you!

193
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:21,202
Bye.

194
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:25,676
I'm so stupid.

195
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:27,875
Why can't I just tell him the truth?

196
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:34,389
Sana would be so disappointed
if she knew what I was doing.

197
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:44,899
Damn Tetsuo!

198
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:46,732
Excuse me.

199
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:49,399
Pleased to meet you.

200
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:51,269
My name is Reiko Hayama.

201
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:52,171
I work at headquarters.

202
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,032
I know.

203
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,677
You're the outside consultant.

204
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:57,707
Yes.

205
00:12:57,914 --> 00:12:59,677
May I come in?

206
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:01,275
Yes, please.

207
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:02,978
Thank you.

208
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:14,055
Can I help you?

209
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:17,833
Yes, there's something
that's not matching up.

210
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:21,897
The Momokawa line's
revenues shot up recently.

211
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:23,906
Would you know why?

212
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:29,068
I have no idea.

213
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:32,076
Oh come on, what's the secret?

214
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:34,683
I think I should know, as a consultant.

215
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:35,945
Oh, tell me.

216
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,481
Tell you...

217
00:13:38,555 --> 00:13:39,817
What is this?

218
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,417
What?

219
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:45,052
I'm using my body to show
you how much I want to know.

220
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:49,829
How can you put a woman in this
position and still feign ignorance?

221
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:53,059
But I really don't know anything.

222
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:53,966
Liar!

223
00:13:55,772 --> 00:14:00,471
You're not attracted to me, that's
why you won't tell me anything.

224
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:02,204
That's not true.

225
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:04,779
You are very attractive.

226
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:08,079
But I still can't tell you our secret.

227
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:11,150
I knew it.

228
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:14,990
What are you doing?

229
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:18,820
What is this?

230
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:20,255
Just handcuffs.

231
00:14:20,563 --> 00:14:21,552
Don't cause a scene.

232
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:22,763
Handcuffs?

233
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:24,299
What for?

234
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:27,100
Why are you asking the obvious?

235
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,034
I want you to tell me your secret.

236
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:32,834
On my terms.

237
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:34,702
Then...

238
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,544
You mean...

239
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:39,338
What are you saying?

240
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,051
Look, not a single stain.

241
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:46,049
These are for this!

242
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,333
So, how do you like
the heels and the whip?

243
00:15:01,237 --> 00:15:03,205
Are you going to tell me your secret?

244
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:09,211
What are you mumbling about?

245
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:23,255
If you don't want anymore
pain, tell me the truth.

246
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,754
No way, she's just like her picture!

247
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:28,726
I can't hear you.

248
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:30,097
So what is it?

249
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:33,528
What should I do?

250
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:35,470
Should I tell her?

251
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,668
Listen, I have an idea
of what's going on.

252
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,079
So I understand why
you don't want to talk.

253
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:50,110
But if you tell me, I can see
to it that you aren't punished.

254
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:52,478
So, do you feel like talking?

255
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:55,456
If you don't agree, you should quit.

256
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:58,556
Fine, I'll talk.

257
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:02,259
Good, that's good.

258
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:09,936
Serves him right.

259
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:32,359
It feels good!

260
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:41,370
More, I want more!

261
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:10,457
I have almost all the proof I need.

262
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:19,903
Today, I'm going to
tell Tetsuo how I feel.

263
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:24,371
Hello.

264
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:27,381
Can I help you?

265
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:30,317
Is Tetsuo Amano here?

266
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:33,349
All the employees are in
the station master's office.

267
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:36,148
I think it's going to be a while.

268
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,354
I see.

269
00:17:39,262 --> 00:17:40,729
I'll wait then.

270
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:46,865
Are you Amano's girlfriend?

271
00:17:48,638 --> 00:17:53,075
No, we're childhood friends.

272
00:17:53,943 --> 00:17:54,602
Oh.

273
00:17:59,182 --> 00:17:59,705
Wait.

274
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,214
What is it?

275
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:05,518
You are so cute, I could eat you.

276
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:06,350
What?

277
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,623
Would you like to have some fun with me?

278
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:10,317
I can help you.

279
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:12,451
You could use some money, right?

280
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:14,728
No thanks.

281
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:17,426
What a fresh child.

282
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,145
You're so sensitive.

283
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:34,546
That's why I love young girls.

284
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:42,557
You're really feeling it.

285
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:44,989
It's more than I expected,
but it makes me happy.

286
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:47,426
What are you doing?

287
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:48,721
Please stop.

288
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,567
What do you mean, you're so wet!

289
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:56,597
If you didn't like it,
you wouldn't be so wet.

290
00:18:57,907 --> 00:18:59,499
Doesn't it feel good?

291
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,307
It does not feel good!

292
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:04,278
Be quiet!

293
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:05,345
Be good.

294
00:19:05,882 --> 00:19:06,576
Stop!

295
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:09,517
What's wrong with you?

296
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:12,316
Don't you know how to have fun?

297
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:17,491
I'm leaving.

298
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,991
I thought you were
waiting for Tetsuo Amano.

299
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:21,452
Never mind.

300
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:25,726
That's right, you should
stay away from him.

301
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:27,166
What?

302
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,037
He's a pervert.

303
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:34,701
Apparently he's quite
a well known expert.

304
00:19:35,044 --> 00:19:36,568
What are you talking about?

305
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:40,248
If you don't know, you
should ask him yourself.

306
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:44,809
I'm sure he'll use his technique
on you to keep you quiet.

307
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:46,018
Well?

308
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:48,854
Excuse me.

309
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:53,218
What a horrible child.

310
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:22,322
A woman.

311
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:24,159
What's a woman doing here?

312
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:32,295
What?

313
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:33,124
Yeah...

314
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:36,495
What do you mean!

315
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:38,565
Please do as I say.

316
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:40,737
We're almost there, so hurry.

317
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:42,577
Fine okay.

318
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,808
I can't believe that journalist is here.

319
00:20:47,684 --> 00:20:50,710
She has guts, but she's so naпve.

320
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:54,012
Next stop, Kitasato, Kitasato.

321
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:55,485
Please take...

322
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:56,582
Here we go.

323
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:13,506
I did what you asked me.

324
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:16,878
We have passengers
with different tastes.

325
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:17,412
Huh?

326
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:20,438
Don't worry, just go.

327
00:21:20,717 --> 00:21:21,979
Okay.

328
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:23,510
Here we go.

329
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:25,054
Roger.

330
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:28,916
The Midnight Sleazy
Train is ready to go!

331
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:30,090
Ready!

332
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,822
Go!

333
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,176
How disgusting!

334
00:21:56,586 --> 00:21:58,281
This is going to be big!

335
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:01,649
But this is strange,
why not in this car?

336
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:03,020
Where are the girls?

337
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,850
This is an announcement
for car number three.

338
00:22:05,962 --> 00:22:08,522
There is already a woman in your car.

339
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:09,694
There's a woman?

340
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:12,530
Please begin your fantasies
by finding your prey.

341
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:14,533
Is this for real?

342
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:18,037
Oh no, does he mean me?

343
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:21,338
I smell a woman.

344
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,406
There she is!

345
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:29,608
No!

346
00:22:30,153 --> 00:22:32,212
No, please don't!

347
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:35,287
Over here!

348
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:37,417
No, stop!

349
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:39,922
Hey, look at these!

350
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,368
No, someone help me!

351
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:52,772
Here we go!

352
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:07,446
Over here!

353
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:10,325
Here!

354
00:23:10,426 --> 00:23:12,053
No, not that!

355
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:31,404
More!

356
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:05,436
We won't need this.

357
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,004
Excuse me, this is the end of the line.

358
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:04,231
Please wake up.

359
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,138
It's the end of the line.

360
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:08,807
It's already over?

361
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,171
That's right.

362
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:12,640
What did you think?

363
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:14,414
Let's see.

364
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:17,785
I'm so happy.

365
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:24,620
As a journalist, people
don't see you as a woman.

366
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:28,920
You have to put your femininity aside.

367
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:33,161
And so I never have any luck with men.

368
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:37,170
I had lost my confidence as a woman.

369
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:46,915
So I can hardly believe that so
many men enjoyed my womanliness...

370
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:50,351
It won't be this easy with Reiko Hayama.

371
00:25:52,188 --> 00:25:54,588
I feel so satisfied.

372
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:57,958
So what about your article?

373
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:00,687
I won't write it.

374
00:26:01,497 --> 00:26:03,431
That's great news.

375
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:08,432
We're entering the garage, so
if you could please get off.

376
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:09,865
Sure.

377
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:18,875
The happiness of the
passengers of the Sleazy Train...

378
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:21,710
...is linked with the happiness
of the people of Momokawa.

379
00:26:22,451 --> 00:26:24,248
I cannot give that up.

380
00:26:27,123 --> 00:26:29,523
Tetsuo, a well known pervert?

381
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:31,224
It can't be true.

382
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:37,065
There's no way.

383
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:40,324
You should ask him yourself.

384
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:44,736
If you think it's a lie, ask him.

385
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:45,569
Got it?

386
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,836
I can't ask him.

387
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:51,043
I can't ask him that!
