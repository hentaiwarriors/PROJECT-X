1
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,840
You must be the
leader of the Demon Clan...

2
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,103
...who is destroying
the Laan Continent.

3
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,044
Indeed.

4
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,952
How dare you attack me during the
30th anniversary celebration of my reign!

5
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,853
It's my pleasure to attack your
kingdom on such a memorable day.

6
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,526
I won't allow you to
invade my beloved land!

7
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,651
Prepare to die!

8
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,971
Father!

9
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,066
Mother!

10
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,410
Mother!

11
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,255
I will not take your life.

12
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,009
Yes, sir.

13
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,084
All right?

14
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,645
Report to the princess in Asronia.

15
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,952
I'll run as though my life depended on it!

16
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,518
I'm counting on you.

17
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,029
No need for that.

18
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,333
W-Who are you?

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,334
Now that we're here, you
don't need to send anybody.

20
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,398
Send?

21
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,787
Where is Yonus?

22
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,732
I found him.

23
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,642
I see the land owned by
our Demon King is expanding.

24
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
What a great view.

25
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,868
The continent called Laan has
been peaceful for over a hundred years.

26
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,479
Ever since many small independent
countries formed a united confederation.

27
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,321
However, the peace was broken...

28
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,666
...by a mysterious army consisting
of dragons, swordsmen, and sorcerers.

29
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,909
Especially a group called the Shadow
Clan, known for its fast movement...

30
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,513
Those countries that could not
defend themselves against air attacks...

31
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,853
...were gradually
invaded and taken over.

32
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,859
The leader, known as the Demon
Dragon, dresses in all black armor...

33
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,698
...and has become
known as the King of Horror.

34
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,394
Step back.

35
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,099
Yes, ma'am.

36
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,977
Princess Yurie, be
careful of the dew on the grass.

37
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,484
You always talk as
if you're my older sister.

38
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,745
I apologize.

39
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,146
It's all right.

40
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,582
We've grown up
together just like sisters.

41
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,759
Princess, you're so
thin, yet so feminine.

42
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,657
What are you doing?

43
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,536
We're attending the 30th anniversary
cerebration for the king of Gostaria.

44
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,104
It's a very special occasion.

45
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,272
You should dress accordingly, right?

46
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,614
See, you look nice like this.

47
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,777
I'm just a bodyguard.

48
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,179
Don't you like to dress up nicely?

49
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,948
I know you do, every girl does.

50
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,919
Yes.

51
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,056
I want everybody to celebrate.

52
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,457
The citizen's happiness
is my own happiness.

53
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,292
Yes.

54
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,494
I have an idea.

55
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,832
Let's put these flowers on
the other guard's costumes, too.

56
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,130
No, it's time to go.

57
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,634
I'm sure Prince Elias is
looking forward to seeing you.

58
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,838
Prince Elias...

59
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,471
You two will bring Asronia and
Gostaria together and rule them happily.

60
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,747
All the citizens of our countries,
including me, are waiting for that day.

61
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,153
You're mean.

62
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,860
Dragons!

63
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,363
A flock of Dragons!

64
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,693
Be careful.

65
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,971
Get into a fighting formation.

66
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,567
Yes!

67
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,773
Why are they here?

68
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,239
Princess, the carriage...

69
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,810
Someone is riding it.

70
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,548
I didn't know that was possible!

71
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,616
There was a tribe once called the Shutaam
and they used to have power to do that.

72
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,750
Shutaam?

73
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,588
Your highness, lower your head!

74
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,793
The Shutaam were
extinguished a long time ago.

75
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,636
Who are they?

76
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,383
Your Highness!

77
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,647
I'm all right.

78
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,883
How's everyone else?

79
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,051
Princess, please stay here.

80
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,887
That's the emblem of
the Demon Dragon King.

81
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,424
Don't come any closer, you bastards!

82
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,913
Maya, behind you!

83
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,076
I see it!

84
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,252
How many are there?

85
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,625
Princess!

86
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,629
A ninja, huh?

87
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:37,995
Very interesting.

88
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,274
Who are you?

89
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,445
How dare you attack
Princess Yurie of Asronia!

90
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,289
She's the princess...

91
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,286
Not really my type, but I'll take her.

92
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,624
I won't let you!

93
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,203
Damn you!

94
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,011
Oh, this is your technique.

95
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:24,914
What?

96
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,418
Cute.

97
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,351
I like that in a woman.

98
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,785
Maya!

99
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,651
Unfortunately, I don't
have much time now.

100
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,817
Maya!

101
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,689
What did you do to Maya?

102
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,889
Princess Yurie, come with us.

103
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:16,960
Take your hands off of me!

104
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,869
How dare you!

105
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,367
The Demon Dragon King is
waiting for you at Castle Esten.

106
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,399
Castle Esten?

107
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,437
Has Gostaria fallen to the
Demon Dragon King's hand?

108
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,709
The Demon Dragon King!

109
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,248
I knew it.

110
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,647
Let me go!

111
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,352
I can't let the princess go with them.

112
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,722
Maya!

113
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,730
P-Princess Yurie!

114
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,233
Leave me alone!

115
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,599
Let me go!

116
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,444
Traveling in the sky can
be dangerous, so be quiet.

117
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,709
We are going back!

118
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,297
Castle Esten.

119
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,596
Are you awake?

120
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,238
It's awful.

121
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,328
Oh, no.

122
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,960
I feel a dirty gaze from somewhere.

123
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,152
I have brought Princess
Yurie of Asronia Kingdom.

124
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,962
Princess Yurie, welcome to my castle.

125
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,169
He's the Demon Dragon King.

126
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,612
What?

127
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,347
The princess has been kidnapped
by the Demon Dragon King?

128
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,642
Oh, my God.

129
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,084
Hang on, Roletta.

130
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,355
Maya, did you actually
see the Flying Dragon clan?

131
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,354
Yes, I saw the Rose and
Skull emblem with my own eyes.

132
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,026
I should not have let
you take care of the princess.

133
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,293
What are you going to do about this?

134
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,765
Do with my body as you wish.

135
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,202
I'm very impressed.

136
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,800
Make up for your failure with your life!

137
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,371
Hold it, Gooseman.

138
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,375
Maya's death will not
bring the princess back.

139
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,747
But, Your Majesty...

140
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,948
Yurie's guard had to be Maya.

141
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,213
When Yurie was a
little girl, she was very shy...

142
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,385
...and didn't trust anyone except Maya.

143
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,760
I am your new bodyguard.

144
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,933
My name is Maya.

145
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,565
I'm at your disposal.

146
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,169
Really?

147
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,663
Then be my big sister.

148
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,737
Promise me, Maya.

149
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,745
Excuse me, sir.

150
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,185
What is it?

151
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,656
The Flying Dragon Clan has
allegedly invaded the Hita Village.

152
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,558
What!

153
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,761
The Demon Dragon King is a ruthless
conqueror who's invaded many lands.

154
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,358
Gooseman, I'm counting on you.

155
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,828
Yes sir, I'll leave right away.

156
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,772
Maya, you must bring our
princess back no matter what.

157
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,673
Don't come back alive without the princess.

158
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,272
Yes, I swear on my soul.

159
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,945
Please be patient, Princess Yurie.

160
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,049
I swear to save you.

161
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,449
I swear!

162
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,240
Beautiful...

163
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,141
Is this man really
the Demon Dragon King?

164
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,912
Are you surprised, Princess?

165
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,487
I haven't revealed
myself for a long time.

166
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,460
Please, take a seat.

167
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:19,536
Oh, that hides my aura from my
enemies so they won't find my true identity.

168
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,271
Are you really the Demon Dragon King?

169
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,672
When we're alone,
please call me Andreas.

170
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,210
Andreas?

171
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:28,709
Right.

172
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,642
No, Demon Dragon King...

173
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,345
I would like to ask you something.

174
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,019
About the royal family
of the Gostaria kingdom?

175
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,057
Yes, I killed them.

176
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,019
We demanded their surrender
but they chose death to obedience.

177
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,561
Both the King and Queen.

178
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,736
What happened to the other people?

179
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,867
Oh yes, of course, their two children...

180
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,906
...Princess Denise and Prince Elias.

181
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,372
Of course they are alive.

182
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,140
I don't like meaningless killing.

183
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,786
Where are they now?

184
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,789
Would you like some hot soup?

185
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,550
No thank you.

186
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,218
So how are they?

187
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,848
Lady Denise!

188
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,945
Princess Yurie!

189
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,647
You idiot!

190
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,459
You spilled the soup!

191
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,052
Please forgive my rudeness.

192
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,390
Lick it up.

193
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,627
Yes, Mistress Karla, my pleasure.

194
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,208
Lady Denise...

195
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,447
She decided to
become my pleasure slave.

196
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,539
Pleasure slave?

197
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,446
Yes.

198
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,919
She's not allowed to
speak when you talk to her.

199
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,758
I'm so sorry.

200
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,021
Don't move so slow!

201
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,626
You're dismissed when you're done.

202
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,037
Prince Elias...

203
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,573
Where is Prince Elias?

204
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,482
Don't worry, he's fine.

205
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,310
Oh, you were
engaged to him, weren't you?

206
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,684
Please let me see him.

207
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,088
It's up to you.

208
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,089
But first, you'll have to accept my offer.

209
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,152
Your offer?

210
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,928
Yes.

211
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:05,333
I've taken a great risk to kidnap
you to aid my conquering Asronia.

212
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,965
Therefore, you are now my property.

213
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,271
Don't come any closer.

214
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,607
I'll not be your hostage.

215
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,178
If I am to be your property,
I'd rather bite my tongue and die!

216
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,444
I see.

217
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,682
That's up to you, but
take a look at this first.

218
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,859
This is one of the
villages in Asronia, called Hita.

219
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,530
Die, all those who disgrace my Asronia!

220
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,693
Gooseman!

221
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,533
Oh, is he the famous
spear fighter, Sir Gooseman?

222
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,532
But he's not our enemy.

223
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,144
Now, Princess, this is the highlight.

224
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,412
Do you see those girls
who are about your age?

225
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,820
No!

226
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,190
Shut up!

227
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,086
Stop it!

228
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,393
What are you going to do them?

229
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:11,229
Maybe you don't know, but that
is made from the dried Maldo tree.

230
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,273
That induces sexual stimulation.

231
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,945
Are you humiliating
those girls because of me?

232
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,577
Aren't you going to watch it, princess?

233
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,582
You can hear their voices of joy.

234
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,617
No, stop it!

235
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,913
Please, stop it...

236
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,784
Stop, please stop it!

237
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,258
Don't worry, they're not suffering.

238
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,460
It's about time for the
Maldo to start working.

239
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,210
My body is getting paralyzed.

240
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,617
What's wrong, Princess Yurie?

241
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,187
Are you envious of them?

242
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,988
Please turn it off.

243
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,520
They will be
enjoying it until the morning.

244
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,694
This is just the beginning.

245
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,787
What will happen to them afterwards?

246
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,130
After being humiliated
by your barbarous soldiers?

247
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,729
The flying dragons
get hungry, you know.

248
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,298
That's terrible, just terrible!

249
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:25,974
Then...

250
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,314
...you'll agree to be mine?

251
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,679
No...

252
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,483
What is this strange feeling?

253
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,755
No...

254
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,330
You can't do this...

255
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:53,164
Well, until you say yes, I will take
each village in your country, one by one.

256
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,170
Oh, my body is getting hot!

257
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,340
L-I don't care what happens to me.

258
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,510
So please let those girls go.

259
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,349
All right, so show me some proof.

260
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,429
Impressive, Master Andreas.

261
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,905
He's taking her body already.

262
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,637
I wonder if that's the
woman the master told us about.

263
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,180
I know how you're feeling inside.

264
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,687
Look how wet your underwear is.

265
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,327
P-Please don't say that.

266
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,093
No!

267
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,896
I want you to take off the rest.

268
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,675
That's enough!

269
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,433
I beg you.

270
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,571
I can't do it anymore.

271
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,373
That's fine, you don't
care about your people.

272
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,638
That's...

273
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,117
Then, take it off.

274
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,514
No, I can't.

275
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,583
You're giving me a hard time.

276
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,755
What?

277
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,490
No!

278
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,899
You asked for it.

279
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,603
This is so humiliating.

280
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,677
You just need to obey me.

281
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,579
Accept me.

282
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,051
You are the only one
who can save your country...

283
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,381
...and Prince Elias.

284
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,817
Lord Elias...

285
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,885
Yes, it's all up to you.

286
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,796
If you obey me, I will let you see him.

287
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,792
Don't be afraid.

288
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,632
Now...

289
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,407
It feels warm...

290
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,307
His lips, his body.

291
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,450
Why, why do I feel so warm all over?

292
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:26,690
No!

293
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,257
You have such a beautiful breasts.

294
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,824
I'm so aroused.

295
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,658
D-Don't do that anymore.

296
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,030
No!

297
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,661
Please don't touch me like that.

298
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,002
If you continue, I'll be...

299
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,640
Oh?

300
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,241
You're so wet.

301
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,479
Don't say such things.

302
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,509
You've never done this before?

303
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,017
I know you are an innocent princess.

304
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,316
Please stop now.

305
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,354
You will want more soon.

306
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,061
You shouldn't go down there.

307
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,698
Yes, I should.

308
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,729
You are so beautiful.

309
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,376
I can't take this...

310
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,551
Sir Gooseman!

311
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,021
Sir Gooseman!

312
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,920
Maya?

313
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,731
Why are you here?

314
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,258
Where are my soldiers?

315
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,933
I'm sorry.

316
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,703
You saved me?

317
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,570
I don't appreciate it.

318
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,740
You should be somewhere else.

319
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,081
I'm sorry, sir.

320
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,119
I have no clue how
to save the princess.

321
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,515
The Flying Dragon Clan...

322
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,357
What a horrible enemy.

323
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,262
But we have to imagine what kind of
pain the princess is going through now.

324
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,390
I'm all right.

325
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,193
I can return to the castle on my own.

326
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,795
Don't hesitate!

327
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,694
Go!

328
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,400
Yes, sir!

329
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,736
Much obliged, Maya.

330
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,939
You are the only hope for our princess.

331
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,078
Save our princess!

332
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,219
I now grant this medal of
honor to Commander Gooseman.

333
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,957
Keep up your good
efforts for Asronia, Gooseman.

334
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:56,870
Oh, no!

335
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,269
Lord Andreas!

336
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,076
It's so good, Andreas!

337
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,412
Now, let's begin, Yurie.

338
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,718
We will become one.

339
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,050
I can't do that, I can't!

340
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,390
Don't be scared.

341
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,520
Leave everything to me.

342
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,064
Yurie, I'm coming inside of you.

343
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,196
I've been waiting for
this moment for a long time.

344
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,002
I can feel you
squeezing me so passionately!

345
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,006
D-Don't say such things.

346
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:38,675
I feel his shape, size, and movement!

347
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,348
No!

348
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,314
Yurie, is it good?

349
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,525
L-I'm coming, I'm coming!

350
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,263
My soul is being blown away.

351
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,726
Somebody, help me!

352
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,197
Release everything that is you!

353
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,100
Awaken your feelings!

354
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,531
No!

355
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,682
Where am I?

356
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,254
I'm not scared.

357
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,398
I feel so comfortable here...

358
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,523
What's going on?

359
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,230
I knew it.

360
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,901
Lady Roletta, please stop.

361
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,930
Lady Roletta, please.

362
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,239
She looks good in this dress.

363
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,165
Oh, I should also bring this.

364
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,242
Lady Roletta, please
pull yourself together!

365
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,606
The King is going to the battle of Hita,
we don't know about the princes yet.

366
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:19,941
What did you say?

367
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,352
So, we're not going to the princess.

368
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,349
Oh, no...

369
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,222
We shall defeat the
Flying Dragon Clan at Hita!

370
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,789
Yes, sir!

371
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,962
Commander Gooseman has arrived.

372
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,636
Gooseman.

373
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,372
I can stand on my own, let me go.

374
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,069
Yes, sir.

375
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,202
I'm glad that you are still alive.

376
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,810
Your majesty, I would like to report.

377
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,537
In your condition, you
shouldn't be speaking right now.

378
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:57,010
This dawn, the Flying Dragon
Clan has left the Village of Hita.

379
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,945
What?

380
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,490
The Demon Dragon King's
invasion plan seems to be postponed.

381
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,718
Why, why now?

382
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,323
B-Because...

383
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,994
The princess?

384
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,997
Yurie saved us?

385
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,201
That is...

386
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,662
That is...

387
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,610
Somebody, take care of Gooseman!

388
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,242
Yes, sir!

389
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,539
I'm sorry, Yurie.

390
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,642
With this size army, we can't
rescue you from Castle Esten.

391
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,087
Looks like you have some appetite.

392
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,068
Where's Andreas?

393
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,931
Can you hear the soldiers' voices?

394
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,771
Put your voices together!

395
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,240
The power of the Flying Dragon Clan!

396
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,970
That's our oath of battle!

397
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,639
We fight until the
world is painted in blood!

398
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,521
In the name of Shutaam!

399
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,793
In the name of Shutaam.

400
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:24,231
The Demon Dragon King is going to kill
the rebel army in the Gostaria mountains.

401
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,941
There are still some fools
left who would oppose us.

402
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,105
Then what
happened to the Hita village?

403
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,245
He kept his word.

404
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,581
He left that area.

405
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,662
This isn't good enough.

406
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,110
I must clear my mind.

407
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,154
Otherwise, I can't beat that sorcerer.

408
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,625
Oh no, I'm having that same feeling.

409
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,138
Why can't I forget that woman?

410
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,133
Princess, please be safe.

411
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,089
You look tired.

412
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,661
Master Andreas
must have worn you out.

413
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:54,888
What are you doing?

414
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,832
It's all right, Princess.

415
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,298
I was told to train
you by Master Andreas.

416
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,968
Do you think I like serving you?

417
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,674
Honestly, I would kill you if I could.

418
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,442
But if I did, my master would kill me.

419
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,015
Well, I really wouldn't mind that.

420
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,684
Don't worry.

421
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,882
But I will do this!

422
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,354
Stop that...

423
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,463
You swallowed the
master's energy from here.

424
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,398
Yes...

425
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,364
So how many times did you enjoy it?

426
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,535
No!

427
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,236
Answer me!

428
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,478
T-Two times.

429
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,180
Oh, my.

430
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,146
I just touched you a little
and you're already so hot.

431
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,216
Please stop.

432
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,394
You're not getting off so easily.

433
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,125
Now, bath time is over.

434
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,073
Princess, please be patient.

435
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,579
I'm coming to rescue you soon.

436
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,145
Look at it.

437
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,416
That's impossible.

438
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,924
So, surprised?

439
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,923
Master Andreas did it for me.

440
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,096
Isn't it wonderful?

441
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,959
That's impossible.

442
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,934
Now, I want you to
taste this cute little thing.

443
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,470
I can't do that.

444
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,133
I can chop off your head anytime!

445
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:47,473
Yes.

446
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:52,275
Hurry up.

447
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,612
Oh, this feeling...

448
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,420
This feeling...

449
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,918
Very good.

450
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,318
Like that.

451
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,624
That's right...

452
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,329
Straighten your throat.

453
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,126
Widen your mouth and suck harder...

454
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,631
You are pleased, aren't you?

455
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:20,638
This is used to be my brother's,
to whom I dedicated my virginity.

456
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,379
No!

457
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,490
Brother, open your eyes!

458
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,687
Please!

459
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,653
One more time...

460
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,955
Hold me one more time!

461
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,003
When he died in battle, the Demon
Dragon King saw how depressed I was.

462
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,007
So he transplanted it for
me with his magical power.

463
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,340
Maybe she and Andreas
still have some humanity left.

464
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:05,654
That's...

465
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,385
Don't do it on your own!

466
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,120
I just want you to enjoy it more.

467
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,689
Very good.

468
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:17,031
If you understand,
let's go one step further.

469
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,041
You know what you need to do.

470
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,371
No.

471
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,779
Put this inside of you by yourself.

472
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,080
I can't do that.

473
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,211
You disobey me?

474
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,751
I know you want me.

475
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,084
What a look on your face.

476
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,493
That must drive master Andreas crazy.

477
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,797
Don't you want it now?

478
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,930
Yes.

479
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,766
Then, do it now.

480
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,066
Yes.

481
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:55,205
Good.

482
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,565
You're so tight.

483
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,775
Go on, move yourself.

484
00:36:59,370 --> 00:36:59,872
Yes.

485
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,678
Good, it's so good.

486
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,710
That's the way.

487
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,542
I'm coming!

488
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,757
That's my princess.

489
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,083
She's not been released yet?

490
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,479
The rebel army
numbers about two hundred.

491
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,286
Instead of going around the mountain,
shouldn't we go straight to the seaside?

492
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,361
What do you think, sir?

493
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,686
I leave it to you.

494
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:12,473
Yurie, open yourself and come to me.

495
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:22,755
Where?

496
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,318
Where are you taking me?

497
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,566
You were very obedient to my
training, so I will give you a reward.

498
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,658
A reward?

499
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,332
Here we are.

500
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,143
You can do it as usual.

501
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,676
What, what's going on?

502
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,719
Don't be so slow!

503
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,412
Another person?

504
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,417
Hey, lick this woman's toe.

505
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,127
Yes, master Karla.

506
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,621
That voice.

507
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,631
If you don't obey, this guy will get hurt.

508
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:13,968
Unless, you like others
to get hurt because of you.

509
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:28,016
It's so good that you
are such a merciful slut.

510
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,719
How about some appreciation?

511
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,993
Yes, thank you very much.

512
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:33,989
That voice.

513
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,430
I can't believe this!

514
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,237
Hey, don't you want to see his face?

515
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,139
Stop this!

516
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,899
That's enough, please.

517
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,135
That voice can't be...

518
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,313
What a reunion!

519
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,643
N-No!

520
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,811
Princess Yurie!

521
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,250
Lord Elias...

522
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:06,358
How about reuniting as
slaves after being engaged?

523
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,761
Please, don't humiliate
me in front of the princess.

524
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,598
Elias, don't be shy before her.

525
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,905
Please forgive him.

526
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,698
I'm sorry.

527
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,938
I'm so ashamed to
have you see me like this.

528
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,774
At least now I know that you're alive.

529
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,882
You two make me want to cry.

530
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,714
Now, let's begin.

531
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,381
I will let you enjoy each other.

532
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,783
That's...

533
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,723
See, he can get ready
as soon as I touch him.

534
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,634
Oh, master Karla.

535
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,670
Don't you want him?

536
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,306
Don't you?

537
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,804
Princess Yurie!

538
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,538
No!

539
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,495
Somebody, somebody, help me!

540
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,272
Demon Dragon King!

541
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,421
Andreas!

542
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,330
Sorry.

543
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,432
I need it for now.

544
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,382
Move on!

545
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,349
We've got enough enemies!

546
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,750
Keep fighting them!

547
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,019
Follow our king, we are
stronger than our enemies.

548
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,998
Open yourself to me, Yurie!

549
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,563
Release your soul!

550
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:48,155
I have to serve Lord
Andreas in order to live...
