...and there is no one to pick up the corpses.

The "ninja" are still assassins
and conspirators of the darkness...

...and live in a hidden village.

Please turn blind eyes, Lady Youga!

23
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:27,138
We just want to lead a normal life in the city!

24
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,305
What?

25
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,981
You are leading a normal ninja life here, aren't you?

26
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,386
No! What we mean is...

27
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:39,324
...a little one-bedroom apartment, poor but happy.

28
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,621
We would go shopping together.

29
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,897
We would play computer games.

30
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,761
We would cook together.

We would share pajamas between the two of us.

34
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,806
And I'll enter you, just like that.

Don't go on and on about stupid things!

absurd! Don't even speak!

43
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,107
Day after day, night after night, fooling around?

44
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,506
Excuse me...

45
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,670
We didn't say all those details...

Shut up, shut up!

47
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,542

49
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,585
Have you forgotten everything
I have done for you two?

the price of breaking our code.

Stay still, Sir Tsukikage.

55

Watch and learn.

56
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:08,013
Take your eyes off her for a moment,
and Suzuka shall lose her life.

57
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,943
No, let me go!

58
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,384
We shall make an example of
you by shaming you in public!

59
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,821
Suzuka!

60
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:29,469
How do you like our clan's secret aphrodisiac?

61
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,333
No!

62
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,742
No. My strength is leaving me, yet...

63
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,615
...down there, my pussy is acting
like it's got its own will...

64
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,553
...as if it doesn't belong to me.

65
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,283
I'm going to lose it. No. Not like this.

66
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,660
Not while everyone's watching, including Tsukikage.

67
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,970
I can't hold back anymore!

68
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,246
Damn.

69
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,758
Tsukikage, it must be vexing to you to just watch.

70
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,022
Ninja art, bedchamber secret technique...

00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,587
Are you begging for your life? How ugly!

180
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,253
Of course not.

181
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,361
I don't want you to crack the eggs!

182
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,526
Dare not speak such nonsense!

183
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,530
I'm not kidding, Sagiri! Time out!

184
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,406
Welcome!

185
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,344
Would you like fries with that?

186
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,639
Just kidding.

187
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,020
There you are!

188
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,059
She used the transfiguration trick.

189
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,045
Why does she want to bring me back now?

190
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,453
Good, the eggs are safe.

191
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,848
Welcome home, Suzuka.

192
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,255
What kept you?

193
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,464
Sagiri! Where did you come in from?

194
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,860
Over there.

195
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,872
Please go home!

196
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,398
I have no intention of ever
going back to the ninja village.

197
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,168
Even if Lady Youga ordered me to.

198
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,874
This has nothing to do with Lady Youga.

199
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,246
Huh?

200
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,481
This is between you and me, Suzuka. Just the two of us.

201
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,086
The two of us? What?

202
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,626
How could you say that? You're so mean.

203
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,492
How could you become an Escaped
Ninja without telling me?

204
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,030
Without telling you?

205
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:56,933
Not only that, but you left with a man!

206
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,698
What?

207
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,502
Those days of ours, back in the ninja village...

208
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:07,103
What do you make of those days of love?

209
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,977
They were back then...

210
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,084
It was just because you were so aggressive.

211
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,246
I could say I was confused for the time being...

212
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,553
...or I could say I was just
curious at that awkward age.

213
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,025
You know?

214
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,188
How could you say that?!

215
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,992
Or, rather, I should say I was just young...

216
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,796
...or that it was my youth taking over.

217
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,233
You toyed with my heart and body.

218
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,838
Hold on a second, Sagiri.

219
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:41,277
You make it sound so bad, but, Sagiri...

220
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,048
Your guard is low!

221
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:50,917
Damn!

222
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,115
I can't move!

223
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,655
I tricked you, Suzuka.

224
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,724
I'll take my time, and remind your body...

225
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,593
...what it was like when your youth took over.

226
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,805
I will make sure you will never
be able to forget about me.

227
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,444
Then you will want to come back for sure.

228
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,389
All right!

229
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:31,093
Tie this up, and you can go home.

230
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,495
Okay.

231
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,940
Sagiri...
You like it here...

232
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,809
And here...

233
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,145
And here...

234
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,160
And here...

235
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,527
No.

236
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,028
No!

237
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,406
Don't attack all my sensitive areas.

238
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,934
It feels good, doesn't it?

239
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:29,483
I know all your weak spots, Suzuka.

240
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,350
No, no!

241
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,018
More, more.

242
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,028
No, Sagiri.

243
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,997
No.

244
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,641
Now...

245
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,449
Bedchamber secret technique, "Spectral Penal Shape!"

246
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,595
How do you like it?

247
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,859
I shall penetrate you with my mental energy.

248
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,930
No!

249
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,012
Do you like it, Suzuka?

250
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:41,324
You like it, Suzuka, don't you?

251
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,997
No more.

252
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,828
Hey, stop it, Sagiri!

253
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,204
It's already...

254
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,202
No, we've just begun.

255
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,315
It's about the time Tsukikage comes home.

256
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,318
Once I show you to Tsukikage like this...

257
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,415
...then you're all mine.

258
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:19,162
Suzuka! You prefer a girl to me?!

259
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,267
Abandoned in the big city, Suzuka,
you'll have only one choice...

260
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,632
Coming back to the ninja village. Back to me.

261
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:43,581
How does it feel to be raped on the bed...

262
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,625
...where you make love with Tsukikage every night?

263
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,424
No. Not like that. Not every night.

264
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,864
Every night and every morning!

265
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,959
You!

266
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,530
Do you think you're in any
position to talk back to me?

267
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,337
Here we go.

268
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,473
It sounds like he's back.

269
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:12,877
No.

270
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,083
No, don't come home!

271
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:20,424
What if Tsukikage sees me like this?

272
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:26,598
Go ahead, make noise to welcome him.

273
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,996
He will hate me!

274
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:31,804
- Suzuka, I'm home!
He will hate me!

275
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:31,909
- Suzuka, I'm home!
{\i1} {\i0}

276
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,666
Suzuka?

277
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,108
No!

278
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,414
I'm home.

279
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,552
Suzuka?

280
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,133
This is it!

281
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,727
Suzuka!

282
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,542
Don't look!

283
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,404
Suzuka...

284
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,919
Threesome!

285
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,034
Sagiri! Long time, no see!

286
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,194
Tsukikage!

287
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,467
You two are having fun! Let me join you!

288
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,200
How dare you?

289
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,038
So you went for my Suzuka, Sagiri...

290
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,306
I compliment you for your bravery.

291
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,870
No, Suzuka is mine!

292
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,745
Shut up, shut up!

293
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,953
A woman dares to attack another
man's woman, lusty and sensual...

294
00:20:56,188 --> 00:21:00,420
...skin on soft skin, is it a sigh
or a moan? This is a forbidden love.

295
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,518
Tsukikage, at your service.

296
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,857
I shall represent the Moon...

297
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,328
...and punish you!

298
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,390
Here I come, "Secret Sword, Shadow Destroyer!"

299
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,808
Ouch! Stop it, Tsukikage!

300
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:18,332
You're so heavy.

301
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:23,246
Soon enough, both of you will be coming under me!

302
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,347
Who would ever come for you!

303
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,046
We shall see.

304
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:32,187
I haven't wasted my days and
nights doing it with a ninja girl.

305
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,351
Hey, wait...

306
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,529
"Electric Light, Chinese Bamboo One-Letter Elimination!"

307
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,672
"Lightning Gravity Throw!"

308
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,677
"Electron Full Moon Strike!"

309
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,584
And now, "Plasma Twist!"

310
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,965
I have no idea what...

311
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,662
Sagiri, what is this slutty noise of yours?

312
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,974
No way. I won't give in to a man...

313
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,907
But what is this?

314
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,775
My core is undulating.

315
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,949
It feels like something is about to flood.

316
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,892
No. What's going on?

317
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,265
Sagiri's force is gathering.

318
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:55,933
Combined with Tsukikage's movement,
it's creating a huge tidal wave.

319
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:02,540
No, don't!

320
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,474
Tsukikage, I...

321
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,352
Come!

322
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,864
Tsukikage!

323
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:51,354
Damn! A defeat! But remember...

324
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,166
Ouch! My hip!

325
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,870
I won't let you get away with this.

326
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:18,848
Hey, Tsukikage.

327
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:19,570
Yeah?

328
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,927
Don't you want to ask me anything?

329
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:29,462
Suzuka, who do you love most right now?

330
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,530
You, of course.

331
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,102
Right?

332
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,873
So why not leave it at that?

333
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:39,110
We said goodbye to our past
when we left the ninja village.

334
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,842
We only have the present and the future.

335
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,217
Tsukikage!

336
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,843
Hey, you.

337
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:53,723
As for me, I've had ten or twenty ninja girls.

338
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:56,390
What did you say?

339
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,762
Twenty?

340
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,966
Ten or twenty?

341
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,868
In the ninja village?

342
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,632
No, I meant...

343
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,668
What do you mean by that?

344
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,541
It backfired.

Did I take my clothes off too much?

350
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:30,515
I'll rip her clothes off for the sake of art.

351
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:34,279
Now, a preview while I change my clothes.

352
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,015
To my surprise, Sagiri appears before us again.

353
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,148
And she's in love with Tsukikage!

354
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:43,888
She does this, she does that,
she just doesn't know when to quit.

355
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:46,429
Hey, Sagiri, keep your hands off of Tsukikage.
