1
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:42,445
Here I come!

2
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:52,655
You fell again?
You're so clumsy.

3
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:57,663
My bad!

4
00:00:58,672 --> 00:01:00,663
I scraped it.

5
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:12,246
Angel Kiss's specialty!

6
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,617
Ultra Super Deluxe Parfait!

7
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:16,622
Are you sure, Chihaya?

8
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,681
Don't worry, I got it.

9
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:26,632
It's sticky.

10
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,691
Chihaya.

11
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:46,709
Tsuyoshi, can I come in?

12
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,423
Septem Charm Magical Kanan

13
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,624
Palpitating Summer Camp
Part one

14
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:07,332
What the hell are you doing?
It's still noon!

15
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:09,375
Hey, you too, sister!

16
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,677
Just because we're twins,
doesn't mean we have no privacy!

17
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:15,681
I already told you that Chihaya
has a boyfriend named Natsuki.

18
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:17,683
That pretty little sissy.

19
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:20,686
Sissy? How old are now?

20
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:24,747
I'll be sure to turn Chihaya's head
during summer camp!

21
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:31,894
It is true that Natsuki can't come along
to the summer camp tomorrow...

22
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:35,501
because he's not a student
of the Meihou Academy.

23
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:39,296
But that doesn't necessarily mean
that you'll become her boyfriend.

24
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:43,709
Good luck, now.

25
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:46,211
Goodbye, goodbye.

26
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:52,718
The earth is in danger.

27
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:56,719
Someone is using Seeds stolen
from the magical kingdom of Ever Green.

28
00:02:58,024 --> 00:03:02,188
...and is setting traps of chaos and erotica.

29
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,751
As long as I live...

30
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,549
I'm not going to let wicked things happen!

31
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:34,157
Let's go, time to transform!

32
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:35,193
Got you!

33
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:37,253
Hey!

34
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:11,854
Carmine!

35
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,793
Eco-Shower!

36
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:29,080
And that end today's purification.

37
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,512
All that's left is to erase
the couple's memory.

38
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:33,676
You've been getting good at this.

39
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,755
Sayaka's still not feeling too well.

40
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:39,349
So I need work for the both of us!

41
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,295
I won't forgive you!

42
00:04:58,411 --> 00:04:59,776
I'm sorry, Sayaka.

43
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:02,037
Why?

44
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,854
I'll save you.

45
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:09,911
Chihaya.

46
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:17,296
Chihaya!

47
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:21,867
But what was that transformation scene?

48
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:26,539
I thought it'd be cool
if I did something.

49
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,468
Come on! What we're doing
isn't some game.

50
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:34,512
It's a noble and rigorous duty.

51
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,885
And what, may I dare to ask, are you doing?

52
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:44,947
I was just thinking that unlike Chihaya,
Carmine's got some big breasts.

53
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:51,954
Carmine One-Hand Top!

54
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:25,092
It doesn't really matter, but...

55
00:06:25,231 --> 00:06:28,223
Don't you think you're overdoing it
with those breasts?

56
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,094
It's because Natsuki said those things.

57
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:39,244
I'll get myself a wonderful boyfriend
and show him!

58
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:44,349
Now then, everyone,
go enjoy this summer camp.

59
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:47,109
But make sure that you do not leave
the premise of this beach.

60
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:49,048
I'll be watching.

61
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:51,581
Okay!

62
00:06:57,797 --> 00:06:59,389
Hey, Chihaya.

63
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,029
What's up with those breasts?

64
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:10,975
Natsuki?

65
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:12,568
What are you doing here?

66
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,982
Angel Kiss Beachside Cafй?

67
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,574
What the heck is that?

68
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:22,654
Right after you guys left,
Mama decided all of a sudden...

69
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:26,991
It's not fair that only Chihaya gets to
have fun at the beach.

70
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,621
I say we go to the beach, too.

71
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,824
There you have it, that's how
we all decided to go to the beach!

72
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,807
Come in! Welcome to Angel Kiss
Beachfront Cafй!

73
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:45,010
Hi! There's empty seat right here!

74
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:48,536
Ramen, grilled squid,
and shaved ice coming right up!

75
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:52,350
And so, I've been dragged here to help out.

76
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,086
My, my. Isn't that too bad?

77
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:05,087
What were you planning to do
with those breasts while I was gone?

78
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:09,224
It doesn't matter to you.

79
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,930
Not now. People are watching.

80
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:14,869
Unforgivable!

81
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:19,841
Hey, Natsuki,
will you rub suntan lotion on me?

82
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,579
Sorry to keep you waiting!

83
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,319
You're so good at it.

84
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:36,050
Man, I'll take the real things
over fakes any day.

85
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:38,063
Damn you!

86
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:39,859
Take this!

87
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:43,329
Death Blow! Breast Missile!

88
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:50,302
Chihaya!

89
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,634
I'm not like him!

90
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:58,481
I like your flat chest and straight waist!

91
00:08:58,685 --> 00:08:59,947
What was that?

92
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:07,956
Well, excuse me for being flat-chested!

93
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:10,095
So what if I am straight-waisted?

94
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:13,155
Of course that would upset her.

95
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,800
Chihaya!

96
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,105
That stupid Natsuki.

97
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,114
What's wrong?

98
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:35,177
That girl, what is she doing over there?

99
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:38,651
She's still in her uniform.

100
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:42,322
That's Nami Minami.

101
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:43,759
Nami Minami?

102
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,128
It seems that she has a weak body
and is always resting during PE.

103
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:51,193
She looks gloomy and hard
to get along with.

104
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:01,672
You're Nami, right?
Want to play with us?

105
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:05,817
Come on, it's okay.

106
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,010
You can play with us.

107
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,629
Nami!

108
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,891
Don't go that way, Chihaya.

109
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:26,000
There aren't many people.

110
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,740
Lately there's been
kidnappings around here.

111
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:33,135
Kidnappings?

112
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:38,240
She has grown up to be
such a splendid lady.

113
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:40,810
Here you go.

114
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,782
Thank you.

115
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,052
No, I should be thanking you.

116
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:06,268
Natsuki.

117
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:14,082
No, I'm not fit to be with him.

118
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,053
Plus...

119
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:43,915
What's wrong, Chihaya?

120
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:45,673
Did you hear something?

121
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:46,750
No.

122
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,311
That's odd.

123
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:53,792
I will answer it.

124
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:57,519
Your prayers, they shall be answered.

125
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:24,221
Stop it! I'm still...

126
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:35,924
I wasn't aware a Seed was sprouting here.

127
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:41,797
Magical Kanan!

128
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,212
That punk!

129
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,916
I will answer it.

130
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:06,125
Your prayers they shall be answered.

131
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,524
You're Nami?

132
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,339
It's kind of romantic, isn't it?

133
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:16,534
Yeah, how beautiful.

134
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,576
It's true. It's such a beautiful sunset.

135
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:24,082
That's not it, I'm saying you're beautiful.

136
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,988
Natsuki.

137
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:53,033
Hey, were Nami's breasts that big?

138
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:56,243
Natsuki, you idiot!

139
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:06,115
Hey, what are you?

140
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:12,888
You don't like this stuff?

141
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:29,406
Stop it!

142
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:32,415
I already have a person named Chihaya
that I've decided on.

143
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,616
That's not what I was trying to say.

144
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:42,484
There's no point in underwear,
since it's sticking out this much.

145
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,964
No, I can't!

146
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:48,199
It doesn't matter.

147
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:53,269
You see, all you have to do
is rape Chihaya in your heart.

148
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:57,003
Rape her with my heart?

149
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:51,029
Baby.

150
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:53,193
It's still not enough.

151
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:57,732
In that case, there's a much
better "mouth" down here.

152
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:02,370
Look.

153
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:06,807
See? Right here.

154
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,004
Go ahead and lick it.

155
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:36,167
The horizon looked round?

156
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:39,069
It looks like that from that point.

157
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:45,136
I thought you were late,
that's where you were?

158
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,279
Natsuki!

159
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,512
Nami wants to go see
the round horizon with you!

160
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,716
They're round all right. Round.

161
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,190
Was she like that before?

162
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:07,626
She's become daring.

163
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,427
I wonder if something happened.

164
00:18:10,202 --> 00:18:14,161
But the principal told us
not to leave the beach.

165
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,335
Sounds interesting.

166
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:20,639
I'll go along with you as a chaperone.

167
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:25,374
I want to see it too. That round horizon.

168
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,278
That's impossible.

169
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:32,219
We have permission. Now let's go, Natsuki!

170
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:33,347
Okay.

171
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,658
Tsuyoshi, let's go!

172
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:40,866
What's going on with those four?

173
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,668
Man, the clouds sure look ominous.

174
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:46,637
I hope this doesn't turn into a storm.

175
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:57,739
This is relentless!

176
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:23,233
I'm scared!

177
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:27,642
There's nothing for you
to worry about. I'm here to protect.

178
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,742
Natsuki, Natsuki!

179
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:37,722
Tsuyoshi, I'm scared of the lightning.

180
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:39,089
Brother.

181
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:40,723
Chihaya's audacious.

182
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,956
But, with someone other than Natsuki.

183
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:47,555
I wonder if it's okay.

184
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:02,307
Isn't this place a bit dangerous?

185
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:03,547
You're right.

186
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:05,740
But where?

187
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,976
There's a mansion there.

188
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,558
Is anyone here?

189
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:25,997
There's no one here.

190
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:29,367
I can tell that!

191
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:36,542
It looks like it hasn't been
used in a long time.

192
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:39,516
Javantich would faint
if he saw how dirty this is.

193
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:43,450
Natsuki, I'm cold.

194
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:46,654
We need to dry ourselves off.

195
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,350
But, how?

196
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:52,023
Let's find something that burns.

197
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:55,661
And something dry to wear.

198
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:58,260
That might be impossible.

199
00:20:58,571 --> 00:20:59,799
But we need to look.

200
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:01,665
Tsuyoshi, let's go.

201
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:03,705
We'll go this way.

202
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:23,818
Please, wait!

203
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:25,554
Where did Miyuri go?

204
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:27,789
She was just here.

205
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:31,901
Maybe she's searching a different room.
Let's go.

206
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:48,519
What? What's this?

207
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:51,245
No! Let go!

208
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,838
No!

209
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:35,356
It's was only the wind.

210
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:54,809
Who's there? Come out.

211
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:09,857
That scared me. It's just a mirror.

212
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,728
Where's Sayaka?

213
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:43,200
I don't know. Bathroom, maybe?

214
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:44,797
I'll go get her.

215
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:47,232
She'll get lost.

216
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,779
What's that noise? A ball?

217
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,052
Sayaka wasn't at the restroom?

218
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:19,794
I'll answer it.

219
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:24,868
Who's there?

220
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,070
I will answer it.

221
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:34,349
Your prayers shall be answered by me.

222
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:44,392
Your wish is to punish yourself like this.

223
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:49,530
Otherwise, you would remember it.

224
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:50,791
About that night.

225
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:03,047
You're so well-developed.

226
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:07,207
Juvantich must be enthralled.

227
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,522
No, stop it!

228
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,119
Forgive me!

229
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:25,402
They were men who loathed my father.

230
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:30,070
As a stress reliever,
they used my body as a toy.

231
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:32,069
You remember now?

232
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:34,335
I'm the you of that day.

233
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:39,140
Who can I loathe?

234
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:42,313
Tell me!

235
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,004
So that's how it is.

236
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:36,097
Let's go, Natsuki. Time to transform!

237
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:45,410
Natsuki's not...

238
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:47,882
He's not here!

239
00:26:49,988 --> 00:26:51,455
No!
