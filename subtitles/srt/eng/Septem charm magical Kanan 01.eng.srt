1
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,850
Hold it right there!

2
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,421
I finally found you.

3
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,958
Let that lady go, right now!

4
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:57,360
Chihaya, transform!

5
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:17,313
The crimson flame of love and passion!

6
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:21,860
Magical Angel, Carmine!

7
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:27,130
Septem Charm Magical Kanan

8
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,064
Enter the Crimson Magical Warrior Carmine.

9
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:47,320
Suzuhara, 1 meter 50 cm, cleared!

10
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:51,847
Incredible, she beat her own record!

11
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:54,385
You did it, Miyuri!

12
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:58,621
You go, Meihou's Queen
of Decathlete! All right!

13
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:01,656
Yeah!

14
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:08,003
I'm Chihaya Hiiragi.

15
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:11,377
I'm a normal girl that you'd find anywhere.

16
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:35,664
That strange creature I took in
was hurt badly and was weakened.

17
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:41,907
But as it lived with us, it got a lot better,
and I was happy for it.

18
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:48,811
It was a normal story up until then.

19
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:55,015
To my surprise, it all of a sudden
transformed into a human!

20
00:02:57,557 --> 00:03:02,358
I was so surprised, he was naked
and all, never mind that.

21
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,264
Chihaya Hiiragi! I'm going now.

22
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:26,081
So Natsuki, his name is Natsuki.

23
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:27,943
This is what he said.

24
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:33,923
"I am a warrior from another world,
the magical kingdom of Ever Green."

25
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:39,388
The Temple of Darkness,
the area forbidden to all.

26
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,767
The seal has been broken.

27
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:44,832
Someone has stolen the Magic Seeds...

28
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:49,066
filled with the power of darkness,
and escaped to the human world.

29
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:52,441
The Seeds will multiply,
possess humans...

30
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:56,983
and create a horde of demons
living for nothing but their desires.

31
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:00,443
Hazuna. Natsuki.

32
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,811
We understand completely!

33
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:08,225
In my current condition,
I only have enough magic...

34
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:10,455
to send you two brothers
to the human world.

35
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:15,197
I leave it to you for the sake
of Ever Green and the human world.

36
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,704
And on top of that!

37
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,030
I'm still not done.
Listen to me, I'm sorry.

38
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:26,044
It seems I have the rare predisposition
to react with Natsuki's magic.

39
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:29,309
When I kiss Natsuki...

40
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:32,907
I transform into a magical warrior
in order to beat the bad guys!

41
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:36,945
Here I go!

42
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:43,120
Carmine Eco-Shower!

43
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:54,763
Hey Chihaya. He's not coming today?

44
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:57,371
You know, your cousin!

45
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:01,080
Natsuki's here already.
He's probably inside.

46
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:03,279
I came here to investigate.

47
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:06,078
How'd it end up like this?

48
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:11,680
Stop it, I can't hold it in anymore!

49
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:26,102
You don't have to hold it in.
I mean, you came all this way to peek.

50
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:27,104
You need some?

51
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,607
No, I didn't come here to peek.

52
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,445
I was here to investigate.
Anyway, it was an accident.

53
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,541
You accidentally hid under the bed?

54
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:41,653
I felt a presence,
so I came to look and got lucky.

55
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:44,253
Unlucky is what I meant.

56
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,828
You're young. You're still okay?

57
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:28,600
- Natsuki is the same age as us, right?
- Yeah.

58
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:33,165
It'd be nice if he'll be
in the same class as we were.

59
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,173
I don't really...

60
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:41,302
Of course. You want to be with him.
He's your boyfriend.

61
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:43,473
We're not like that.

62
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,518
You're all red. That's so cute.

63
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,877
Miyuri!

64
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:12,870
Miss, I have to stop. My magic...

65
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,412
Call me Taeko, I need it.

66
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,033
Miss, I'm coming again!

67
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:42,331
Sayaka Mizuki. Here I come!

68
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:51,579
Mizuki, let's give it another try.

69
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:57,980
Sayaka is as clumsy as usual, isn't she?

70
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:01,924
Sorry about that!

71
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:04,119
Are you okay?

72
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,092
Tamura!

73
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:06,730
I'm perfectly fine!

74
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,036
I don't' mind at all,
so keep hitting her all you want!

75
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,271
You're so mean, Miyuri.

76
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,539
Come now. She's exuberant
being able to talk with him.

77
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,842
Forgive her, Chihaya.

78
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:22,878
My.

79
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:30,746
Emi!

80
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,417
Are you feeling fine?

81
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:37,161
I thought you were resting in the infirmary.

82
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:39,724
Not anymore.

83
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:12,694
Natsuki?

84
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,333
Where'd you go, Natsuki?

85
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:17,392
Natsuki!

86
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:26,443
A new breed of rats?
No, a raccoon!

87
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:30,675
This is an amazing discovery!
I need to dissect it right away!

88
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,376
- Wait!
- Run!

89
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:38,688
Stop running away!

90
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,617
Someone! Capture that thing!

91
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:46,224
I heard that some guinea pig
bloodied Miss Taeko and ran away!

92
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:50,926
No, that was a guy from Class 5.
He said that the raccoon can transform!

93
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,006
No, that's not it! If you catch the rat,
Miss Taeko will give you head!

94
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:56,538
Man, she's hot!

95
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,270
Let's get him!

96
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:29,406
It's so cute!

97
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:31,409
Is it a raccoon?

98
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:33,468
What's this?

99
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:39,474
You naughty boy.

100
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:49,017
You mustn't!

101
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:54,222
Please don't move!

102
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,432
What's this? It's swollen.

103
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:04,442
You're right. It's getting bigger.

104
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,138
The tip seems to be wet.

105
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,248
That's funny. Take this!

106
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,510
- And this and this and this...
- Don't touch that.

107
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,511
Man, I'm tired.

108
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:26,329
I'm sorry Chihaya. I didn't mean it.

109
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:31,025
The commotion at the infirmary
was you, too, wasn't it?

110
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:34,472
Why are you in that form anyways?

111
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:39,476
Well, this is because
I lost my magic energy.

112
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:42,946
You did something that would
use your magic, did you?

113
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,209
No, it's not always like that.

114
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:47,653
I'm not in my stride yet.

115
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:49,888
And a bunch of factors played a part.

116
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:52,223
It was by chance, I had to do it.

117
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:55,322
I see. It must've been hard.

118
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:56,858
Yeah! It was!

119
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,497
You lecherous pervert! Dirty bastard!

120
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,292
Don't ever come close to me again!

121
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:09,031
Wait up for me, Chihaya!

122
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,308
Is anyone here?

123
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,875
This is Tamura of the basketball team.

124
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:24,453
Could you shut the door, please?

125
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:27,688
Where?

126
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,851
Just shut the door?

127
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,699
It's you. What do you want?

128
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:39,401
What do I want?

129
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,208
I've been watching you
ever since I saw you.

130
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,440
The truth is,
I think I love you, Tamura.

131
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,549
I have practice. I need to go.

132
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:58,785
Tamura, do you know what this is?

133
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:04,323
I'm not wearing anything.

134
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,255
I'm so wet because you're watching.

135
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:40,592
Look how wet I am.

136
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:48,371
Tamura, the equipment will get wet.

137
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:50,874
Want to watch it get even wetter?

138
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:57,509
Could you clean it?

139
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:00,810
With your mouth.

140
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,939
Tamura, you're so hot.

141
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,375
Magical Kanan!

142
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:53,728
It's so big, Tamura.

143
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,957
Tamura, you want to keep going?

144
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:16,787
Or do you like it in here?

145
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:12,807
Cute little boy.

146
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:22,322
Chihaya! Regain your temperament already!

147
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:25,754
This is not the time for that.

148
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:28,760
We have to think of powering up
so we can handle new enemies.

149
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,768
Shut up already!

150
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:34,772
I'm sorry I got you caught up in this.

151
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,774
But I don't have time!

152
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:38,810
I need your power to save the world!

153
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:42,612
That's your problem.

154
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:44,782
What's this "power up?"

155
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:49,254
When you transform, I inject
my magic energy into you, right?

156
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,620
Inject? Isn't there a better word?

157
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:56,693
The injection of magic
is the injecting of bodily fluids!

158
00:16:56,862 --> 00:17:00,798
So all you have to do is to take
my thick juice deeper inside your body!

159
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:05,162
In other words...

160
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,534
Thick juice my ass!

161
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:10,699
You stole my first kiss, and now?

162
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,745
Quit fucking with me!

163
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:16,143
You beast! You beast!

164
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:18,149
Stupid perverted rat!

165
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:10,661
- I'm going, Mama.
- Take care.

166
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,428
Chihaya...

167
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:13,470
I said, shut up!

168
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,713
I think she's a whore.

169
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,972
But she helps people, right?

170
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:27,249
- What's going on?
- You haven't heard?

171
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,412
There's a rumor of a warrior in town.

172
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,420
She comes and saved you
if your attacked like this!

173
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:38,563
Sai, don't do that. They're getting hard.

174
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:41,299
A heroine of justice, you see?

175
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,367
A heroine of justice!

176
00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:45,027
She's just a slut, isn't she?

177
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:47,532
She may be a exhibitionist!

178
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,070
Her clothes were frilly,
but she was wearing doggie panties.

179
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:56,342
Is something wrong?

180
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:59,350
It's nothing! Nothing at all!

181
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:03,521
I'm not ever, ever, ever...

182
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,256
transforming again!

183
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,258
Chihaya!

184
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:12,487
You shouldn't let those rumors
bother you.

185
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:14,428
Right, Chihaya?

186
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,601
Hey, I'm talking to you.

187
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:28,512
Good morning Chihaya,
it's nice to see you.

188
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:30,205
Sayaka, morning!

189
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:37,545
The scent of magic!

190
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:47,097
Nothing gained today.

191
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:09,654
This is a Seed undulation?

192
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,154
This is so embarrassing.

193
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:21,098
Are you sure that this will
cure your disease?

194
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:25,203
You don't believe the words
of your principal?

195
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:27,128
Yes, I do.

196
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:28,734
Very good.

197
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:32,174
Now let's begin your examination.

198
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:36,378
Not bad.

199
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:42,110
How about here?

200
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:49,517
Natsuki?

201
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:51,261
Natsuki?

202
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:54,354
Mafuyu!

203
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:04,970
What is this?

204
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:11,577
What are you thinking?

205
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:18,278
Stupid!

206
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,084
I have to go!

207
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:24,920
What was that?

208
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,531
You have to go?
Go where? Come on!

209
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:33,628
No, please!

210
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,156
What is this? What's going on?

211
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:56,754
There's no doubt about it!
It's the work of a Seed!

212
00:21:56,996 --> 00:21:59,294
Chihaya, let's transform!

213
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:01,462
For the sake of Mafuyu!

214
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,558
That's not fair.

215
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:35,324
You're such a naughty girl,
dirtying the floor.

216
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,397
I'll plug that naughty hole of yours.
Come here.

217
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,940
Stop it, you pervert!

218
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:46,567
Who are you, barging in here?

219
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:48,646
The flame of love and anger!

220
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:52,716
Magic Angel Carmine!

221
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,820
- Carmine! Purification!
- Okay!

222
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:03,822
Carmine Eco-Shower!

223
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:14,438
Mafuyu!

224
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:16,430
Mafuyu!

225
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:21,212
Carmine, it's not over!

226
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:24,574
Carmine!

227
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,682
Why?

228
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:27,775
You purified him!

229
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,685
Is that all you got, Carmine?

230
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:34,723
- Who are you?
- I am Septem.

231
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:40,428
Don't get so cocky because
you purified copies of the Seeds.

232
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:45,765
You went too far.
And it's past your time.

233
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:49,370
- To be done.
- Because of you! You did this!

234
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:59,341
I'll have you feel the power
of the real thing.

235
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:03,982
With that body!

236
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:06,885
Carmine!

237
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:15,630
Shit! Let go!

238
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:19,569
Let's wait here and watch Carmine
get raped. Her ultimate fantasy.

239
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:20,662
Stop it!

240
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,830
No!

241
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:27,135
No don't.

242
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,240
Stop it!

243
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:34,374
Carmine!

244
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:38,783
I think I'll take your magic now.

245
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:40,948
What do you think you're...

246
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:45,562
You're so hard and erect.

247
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:49,532
You getting excited watching
your partner get raped.

248
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:55,273
It's delicious.

249
00:24:58,477 --> 00:25:00,468
Stop! Stop it!

250
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:03,979
No, stop!

251
00:25:05,384 --> 00:25:07,875
I'm scared, save me. Natsuki!

252
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:16,317
To Be Continued
