1
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,150
I want this lily!

2
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,820
You had better stay out of it!

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,130
And what if we don't?

4
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,360
Next, stretch your side.

5
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,330
That's right. This shop will be flooded with customers in no time!

6
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm going to do my best and make up for lost time tomorrow.

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,640
I can't lose to Chado and Miki either...

8
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,410
Here I am! I'm Biki Panther!

9
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,620
Eat this!

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,190
<i>There's no mistake about it. They are angels from Heaven...</i>

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,830
<i>But I still don't understand...</i>

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,700
<i>Why is Zeus training such low-ranking angels himself?</i>

13
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:22,280
<i>Is it possible that he's planning to use them to attack Hell?</i>

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,250
<i>I'm counting on you, Persephone.</i>

15
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,780
Excuse me, Lord Hades...

16
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,920
P-Persephone!

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,150
Why are you still here?

18
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,380
Because, I wanted to talk to you about something important...

19
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,990
Something important?

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,360
Uh-huh. It's about this month's paid vacation.

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,430
W-What?

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,230
Now isn't the time to talk about it.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,590
That's not fair!

24
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,230
I haven't had any vacation this year.

25
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,870
A-All right. Then I'll let you take a long vacation around the end of the year.

26
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,240
I'll give you a bonus too, are you happy now?

27
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,980
Really?

28
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,280
Yes! Now go!

29
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,990
Go out there and get in Zeus's way however you can!

30
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,090
Okay!

31
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,040
Hmm, it seems like everyone is learning pretty well.

32
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,000
This will be a lot of fun...

33
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:42,040
But I feel like someone is trying to get in my way...

34
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,050
Oh, it's just that kid...

35
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,250
Zeu-chu! Zeu-chu!

36
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,520
Zeu-chu!

37
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,320
What's the matter?

38
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,050
Where have you been?

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,560
I went down to Earth.

40
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,730
It takes a lot of divine power to descend to Earth. It's really dangerous!

41
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,000
I know, I know!

42
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,330
Hey, you're blocking my view.

43
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,070
It's Chadoko's turn...

44
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,570
Something bad has happened.

45
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,750
Oshime, will you move?

46
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,400
I don't know what's gonna happen to you.

47
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,880
Move just a little to...

48
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,950
Zeu-chu! Fella was...

49
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,310
I said move!

50
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,760
They're gone...

51
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,790
Did they finish taking a shower?

52
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,190
Okay!

53
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,660
Please stop right there!

54
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,060
Not yet!

55
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,430
Okay, now you can go!

56
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,670
I'm doing a great job!

57
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,440
Please stop right there!

58
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,220
Watch out!

59
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,430
What is going on?

60
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,300
It's not my fault!

61
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,550
Bad Luck

62
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,820
More bad luck?

63
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,950
Yorishiro?

64
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,770
Wow, is it you, Miki?

65
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,400
Yes.

66
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,800
I didn't know you worked here as a priestess.

67
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,070
I want to help as many as people I can.

68
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,300
I see.

69
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,310
You lost your memory?

70
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,620
Yes, something strange has been happening to me.

71
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,080
All of the sudden, part of my memory is gone...

72
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,990
...and I can't remember what was happening...

73
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,260
I wonder if there's anything wrong with me.

74
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,330
I will ask the priest here to give you the blessing of the gods.

75
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,900
Really?

76
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm sure you will be fine.

77
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,230
Thank you so much.

78
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,340
How long do I have to wait?

79
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,340
Sorry I'm late!

80
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,820
Excuse me, but are you the priestess?

81
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,320
Uh-huh.

82
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,320
Well let's start giving you a blessing, huh?

83
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,890
Um, okay.

84
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,590
Well, take off your clothes first.

85
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,430
What?

86
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,730
You need to be naked.

87
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,340
B-But...

88
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,070
You want to feel better, right?

89
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,740
Y-Yes!

90
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,580
Then you gotta do whatever I say. Now!

91
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,380
I haven't had this in a while... It's delicious.

92
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,330
H-How is this going to...

93
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,200
The real ceremony hasn't started yet.

94
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,110
E-Excuse me, is this really a purification?

95
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,110
If you question it, it won't work.

96
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,180
O-Okay!

97
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,050
Yorishiro?

98
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,430
M-Miki...

99
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,000
Wait, um...

100
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,340
What's going on?

101
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,300
T-This is...

102
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,610
Um, Yorishiro?

103
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,850
This is just a purification rite.

104
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,360
Purification rite?

105
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,590
That's right. Would you like to continue the ceremony?

106
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,190
...I'll do my best.

107
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,600
It feels good...

108
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,150
It feels great! Oh yes!

109
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,980
What just happened?

110
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,280
There's no need to worry.

111
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,280
The purification is complete.

112
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,880
I was so close...

113
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,890
But that boy was kinda cute...

114
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,130
Thank you, and please come again.

115
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,700
Everything's going well today.

116
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,540
Yeah.

117
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,840
But I wish there were more customers...

118
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,110
Actually, Yuu...

119
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,310
Hmm?

120
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
Oh, hello!

121
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,230
Minori, how's the bath?

122
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,500
W-What are you doing here?

123
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,600
You don't need to be shy.

124
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,680
You want me to wash your back?

125
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,740
Stop it.

126
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,610
It's all right, don't be shy.

127
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,010
No, it's quite all right.

128
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,480
Suit yourself, then. I'll leave a towel here.

129
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,720
Wait, Yuu...

130
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,880
What is it?

131
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,190
You've been a big help.

132
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:29,950
What?

133
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,890
You know, with the flower shop and everything.

134
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,630
I'm glad that we could help.

135
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,670
But why do you want to help someone so much?

136
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,900
Because that's the test.

137
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,400
What test?

138
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,510
To become a high-ranking angel.

139
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,340
What?

140
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,210
I mean, to become someone who is kind like an angel.

141
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,140
That's why we're helping people.

142
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,290
It's not enough...

143
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,150
We can't reform this shop with so little money.

144
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,860
Well, don't be so discouraged. We've just started.

145
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,030
We have to keep working hard.

146
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,840
It's Lord Zeus.

147
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,370
Lord Zeus...

148
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,810
Oh my goodness.

149
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,180
Oh, girls. There's no need to be so formal.

150
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,940
We appreciate your kindness.

151
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,810
Thank you, Lord Zeus.

152
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,560
So how did everything go today?

153
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,680
Yuu?

154
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,790
Yes, Minori seems happy with our help.

155
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,260
And we also sold a lot of flowers today.

156
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,260
That's very good.

157
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,330
And, how about you? Chadoko?

158
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,160
Well, it didn't work out too well.

159
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,040
Um, okay...

160
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,700
Your answer is always very simple.

161
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,540
How about you, Miki?

162
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,880
Yes. I must say that I have failed today.

163
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,950
Yorishiro looked so sad...

164
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,110
I'm a failure as an angel...

165
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,320
There are so many things I must learn...

166
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,890
I see. Well, keep working hard.

167
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,690
Yes.

168
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:22,170
In any event, I'll give you an opportunity to make many people happy tomorrow.

169
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,330
Really?

170
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,300
We're going to get lots of points!

171
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,910
Thank you so much, Lord Zeus.

172
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,940
We will not disappoint you.

173
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,310
Look forward to it.

174
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,200
Play Lottery Here

175
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,030
So are we working for the lottery?

176
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,100
It seems so.

177
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,700
But why do we have to wear this? It's embarrassing.

178
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,260
I'm sure Lord Zeus has a plan in mind.

179
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,710
We must do what he tells us to do.

180
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,970
Let's get a lot of points!

181
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,210
You're right!

182
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,740
Oh, sorry.

183
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,220
You didn't win, but you get tissue paper.

184
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,230
Sorry. Here's your tissue paper

185
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,190
Sorry. Here's your tissue paper

186
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,230
Sorry!

187
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,230
Sorry.

188
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,310
Sorry.

189
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,240
We can't make anyone happy like this.

190
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,050
Then we should make the red ones first prize!

191
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,790
No Chadoko. We must not cheat.

192
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,190
We'll just hope that someone will win.

193
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:57,060
But don't you think it's strange that there's no prize other than tissue paper?

194
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,720
Oh?

195
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,540
What's this?

196
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,270
It's a bathing suit.

197
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,330
It doesn't look like a prize, but why is it here?

198
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,650
It's also bit provocative, don't you think?

199
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,320
What are they doing now?

200
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,690
Like I care... I'm gonna go bother them anyway.

201
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,100
Yay! It's second prize!

202
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,040
Well, I guess I'll take this one then.

203
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,800
And I want you to wear it.

204
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,240
Huh? Me?

205
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,050
What do you mean?

206
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,780
Oh come on.

207
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,750
It says in right here that if I get second prize, I can ask...

208
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,550
...any one of the girls to wear a bathing suit I pick and take a picture with her.

209
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,720
What?

210
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,930
Thank you!

211
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,440
You gotta be kidding...

212
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,010
This is like a sexual harassment lottery.

213
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,940
Totally disgusting!

214
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,550
I can't believe he picked Yuu over us!

215
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,010
Chadoko, you're angry for a different reason.

216
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,390
So if second prize is this, what's first prize?

217
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,130
It says if you win first prize, you'll get a date with one of us...

218
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,500
What?

219
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,860
I'm not going to lose to you!

220
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,560
Oh, Chadoko...

221
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,610
What's the special prize?

222
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,670
One of the girls will be your girlfriend for a day.

223
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,610
And since she's your girlfriend, you can do whatever you want to her...

224
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,650
What?

225
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:06,590
You pick the special prize and make her into your girlfriend?

226
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,300
You're still young...

227
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,830
I don't understand.

228
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,600
You see, I have a bigger plan.

229
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,860
What is it? Tell me!

230
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,360
You'll see...

231
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,580
I feel so young again, thank you so much.

232
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,810
That's good to hear.

233
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,790
I gotta work harder!

234
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,120
Me too!

235
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,590
Congratulations! It's second prize!

236
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,160
Congratulations! It's second prize!

237
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,930
It's second prize!

238
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,370
Let's roll that thing.

239
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,400
You!

240
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,100
You're those thugs!

241
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,880
That's not a very nice thing to call your customers. We're here for the lottery.

242
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,610
That's right, we are.

243
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,610
Okay, then, go ahead.

244
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,120
I'm going to win the special prize!

245
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,860
Congratulations! It's third prize, tissue paper!

246
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,330
What?

247
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,360
Here you go.

248
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,330
Damn...

249
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,630
One more time!

250
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,270
Third prize!

251
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,370
One more time!

252
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,640
Third prize!

253
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,390
Here is your tissue paper.

254
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,380
What the hell!

255
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,890
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

256
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,020
Third prize!

257
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,960
One more time!

258
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,120
Third prize!

259
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,460
One more time!

260
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,390
Tissue paper!

261
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,670
Third prize! Tissue paper! Third prize! Tissue paper! Third prize! Tissue paper!

262
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,070
One more time!

263
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,580
Oh that's too bad. You don't have any tickets left.

264
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,080
He doesn't have any left.

265
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,720
You idiot! You don't have to repeat after her!

266
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,420
This lottery must have been rigged!

267
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,950
What did you say?

268
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,150
How dare you say that!

269
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,390
Congratulations! You've won first prize!

270
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,160
I'll be your date for a day!

271
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,530
Why do we only get tissues?

272
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,570
Why?

273
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,250
Oh, now I know what you guys are up to.

274
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:42,910
Hmm?

275
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,920
Lottery, huh?

276
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,890
One lottery ticket please.

277
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,760
Oh, hello Yorishiro.

278
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,100
Oh, hi Miki.

279
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,760
And Yuu?

280
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,340
Are you here for the lottery?

281
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,500
Yeah. But tissues will be fine. I have a cold, so...

282
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,230
I hope you win!

283
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,400
Y-Yes.

284
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,310
Hey, that's not fair that only you two have a friend!

285
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,440
Are you going to introduce him to me?

286
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,610
Hi, I'm Yorishiro.

287
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,250
He's such a cutie. He's just my type.

288
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,460
Yay! You won the special prize!

289
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,970
Special prize? Me?

290
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,970
Congratulations, Yorishiro!

291
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,770
Congratulations, come this way, please!

292
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,410
Wait...

293
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,580
Hey, what are you doing!

294
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,740
Yorishiro!

295
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,920
You can't steal our customers!

296
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,330
Who are you?

297
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,300
For the special prize, you get to do it with me.

298
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,050
And the last one...

299
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,100
Your body is so delicious.

300
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,710
Where did they go?

301
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,150
But who was that woman that took Yorishiro?

302
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,950
I've never seen her before.

303
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,990
I bet she's going to make a ransom!

304
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,250
I will make you feel a lot better...

305
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,050
Not yet...

306
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:44,290
In a little while, all of your energy will be mine.

307
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,750
There you are!

308
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,550
Let Yorishiro go!

309
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,700
I was so close...

310
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,570
Don't they have manners?

311
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,960
Who are you?

312
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,060
What are you doing with Yorishiro?

313
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,070
I am planning to suck the life out of him.

314
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,540
What did you say?

315
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,740
You're in so much trouble!

316
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,620
No! We aren't supposed to use our angelic powers.

317
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,090
But Miki...

318
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,220
Well then, I'll go first!

319
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,990
Come out, my pretty babies!

320
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,260
That's the monster from the other day!

321
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,590
There are three of them!

322
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,830
Miki! Chado!

323
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,430
No!

324
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,140
Miki! Chado!

325
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,380
Are you okay?

326
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,350
Hey you monster! Let us off!

327
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,620
Oh, calm down.

328
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,460
What are you going to do to us?

329
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,650
You've got spunk, young lady.

330
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,700
I guess you'll be a perfect play date for my babies.

331
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,660
What? What do you mean?

332
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,670
No!

333
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,520
No! It's disgusting!

334
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,250
Stop it!

335
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,800
Oh my goodness, look at you.

336
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,370
Stop it! You pervert!

337
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,930
What happened to your attitude?

338
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,390
Who are you?

339
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,220
Uh-oh.

340
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,720
Why are you doing this?

341
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,460
Who told you to do this?

342
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,660
I'm not telling you anything!

343
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,630
It's Hades, isn't it?

344
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,170
I guess you already knew...

345
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:51,640
That's right, Lord Hades ordered me to interfere with your plans.

346
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,310
I see...

347
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,710
<i>...but what does this mean?</i>

348
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,380
<i>How does he know about my plan?</i>

349
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,650
<i>That's impossible...</i>

350
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,860
Well, uh, I'll be seeing you soon!

351
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,560
Tell Hades that...

352
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,540
...he shouldn't underestimate my power.

353
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,680
That's no way to treat a beautiful woman!

354
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,820
You jerk!

355
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,860
Everything went great today!

356
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,170
Yeah, up until that big lightning...

357
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,610
But because of that lightning, we got the chance to save Yorishiro.

358
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,110
But who was the kidnapper?

359
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,340
I don't know...

360
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,410
She was very bad!

361
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,610
If she hadn't shown up, Yorishiro and I would have been together!

362
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,620
I don't think so, Chado.

363
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,810
But...

364
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:14,560
After what happened today, now I know Lord Zeus is...

365
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,620
...really looking out for us.

366
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,290
Yeah, I think so too.

367
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,470
Let's work hard tomorrow again!

368
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,400
That's right, my sweet angels.

369
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,410
I will take good care of you...

370
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,110
And what exactly does that mean?

371
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,580
You know what I mean?

372
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,730
No, I don't. Would you care to explain to me?

373
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,660
H-Hera...

374
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,770
<i>Persephone...</i>

375
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,180
<i>What a useless servant...</i>

376
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:21,060
<i>Next time, I shall defeat them with my own hands.</i>
