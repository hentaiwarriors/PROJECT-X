1
00:00:01,014 --> 00:00:03,847
No! No, please, no!

2
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:08,186
I'm scared. Save me, Natsuki!

3
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:16,354
Cerulean Blue Eco-Shower!

4
00:00:16,963 --> 00:00:17,952
What?

5
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:29,964
Who're you?

6
00:00:35,382 --> 00:00:37,612
I am the profound warrior of Azure.

7
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:39,618
Cerulean Blue!

8
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:41,051
Septem Charm Magical Kanan Vol. 2

9
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:43,180
Angel Kiss in Danger

10
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:49,218
I'm sorry, Chihaya.

11
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:53,590
I was with you,
and I let that happen.

12
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,697
Who the hell was that bitch?

13
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,515
Damn you!

14
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,653
Carmine! You okay?

15
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:15,653
Yeah.

16
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:18,657
Thank you for saving me.

17
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:20,716
Are you a magic warrior, too?

18
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:24,663
Unable to purify
such an easy situation as this.

19
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:26,130
The red warrior of passion.

20
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:29,225
Carmine the magical warrior
is nothing but a petty girl!

21
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:31,164
What'd you say?

22
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:36,675
I suggest that you allow me, Cerulean Blue,
to handle the recovery of the Seeds...

23
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:38,734
Don't worry, stay home.

24
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:41,941
What do you mean?

25
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:45,551
My, you're not only lacking
in strength but brains too.

26
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:48,744
I'm saying that you're no longer needed.

27
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,092
What'd you say?

28
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:56,619
You wouldn't happen to be Hazuna's
magical warrior, would you?

29
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:02,758
That's right. She's my partner,
Cerulean Blue.

30
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:05,703
Who's that?

31
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:07,706
He's my older brother.

32
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:08,763
Your older brother?

33
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:14,880
Under the order of Queen of Ever Green...

34
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:17,348
He came to the human world
with me to find the Seeds.

35
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:20,281
Natsuki, you should power up
your partner some more.

36
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:22,820
It's too dangerous at this rate.

37
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:26,449
In other words, you're in the way!

38
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:34,823
I don't care if she's green or yellow,
what is up with her?

39
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:39,304
I'm sorry, Chihaya,
for being too unreliable.

40
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:43,475
If only I had more power,
Carmine would be more powerful.

41
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:48,241
If I had more magic,
I could've released power of love and hope.

42
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:50,673
Natsuki.

43
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:53,786
But it's not like there isn't
a way to power up.

44
00:02:55,655 --> 00:03:00,592
Is that what you were talking about
earlier, about sex?

45
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:04,462
I will inject my magic energy
directly into your body.

46
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:09,334
I'm not saying this to get with you.

47
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:11,834
I want to help you, Chihaya.

48
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:14,967
Natsuki, do you like me?

49
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:17,109
Of course I do.

50
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:20,938
This power up relies heavily
on the relationship between the partners.

51
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:24,149
It has to be between people
who love each other.

52
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:27,285
People who love each other.

53
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,213
Okay, let's do it.

54
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:35,160
It's for the sake of powering up.
It can't be helped.

55
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:36,217
Chihaya.

56
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:38,028
Hold it right there!

57
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:42,429
I just noticed, but since when
did you end up in that form?

58
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:46,831
That was when Septem...

59
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:50,843
My chastity was at stake,
you were doing what?

60
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,235
Fuck you!

61
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:56,109
Chihaya, quit pouting!

62
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,785
That was an inevitable accident!

63
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:03,383
If you had been given head like that,
even you would...

64
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,054
Shut up!

65
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:07,249
Leave me alone!

66
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:14,961
Just when she was getting into the mood.

67
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:16,929
Stupid me!

68
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,263
But still, I wonder what kind of girl
Hazuna picked as his partner.

69
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,209
Natsuki, you idiot!

70
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:28,213
I had decided to give you my virginity.

71
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:31,216
You're still out there
doing it with other girls.

72
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:32,945
Love each other my ass.

73
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,878
You're such a liar!

74
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,216
Natsuki, you idiot!

75
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:51,198
- Give me the ball.
- I want to play too.

76
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,663
This is great.

77
00:04:55,308 --> 00:05:01,008
It seems that she was at it again:
Rumors there was a warrior around.

78
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:06,118
I heard about it, too.
This time there were two, red and blue.

79
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,253
Red and blue?

80
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:14,521
The blue one, I heard,
is strong and beautiful on top of being cool.

81
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:16,060
Bullshit!

82
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,320
I want to see them some time.

83
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:21,832
Mafuyu, you don't remember
anything about yesterday?

84
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:23,162
Yesterday?

85
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,566
In the principal's office yesterday.

86
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:29,264
Principal's office? What are you
talking about, Chihaya?

87
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:33,569
Natsuki erased her memory of yesterday.

88
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,341
Come on, Chihaya!

89
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:46,291
And what is it?

90
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,293
Are you still angry?

91
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,555
Maybe I am.

92
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:51,897
Anyway, I feel a Seed.

93
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:55,300
I'm not transforming anymore!

94
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:56,300
What're you saying?

95
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,303
I'm going to investigate it,
so if anything's up...

96
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,305
I'm call you with my heart!

97
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:02,000
Call me with your heart?

98
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:05,407
Those who love each other
should be able to hear each other's hearts.

99
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:10,372
All right, I'm going now!

100
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:15,415
Those who love each other...

101
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:24,118
What happened?

102
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:27,855
My, this isn't good.

103
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:35,540
Tamura!

104
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,374
What's wrong?

105
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:40,504
Tamura! Tamura!

106
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:44,474
Hang in there, Tamura!

107
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:51,487
I felt the presence of the Seed
somewhere around here.

108
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:07,136
That girl.

109
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,383
I'm sorry to scare you.

110
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:21,386
I need to ask you something.

111
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:24,014
I know. You're Chihaya's cousin.

112
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:26,755
What are you doing here?

113
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,928
I'm Emi Kojima.

114
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:33,455
Emi, is it? That's a good name.

115
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:38,403
Emi, you were at the principal's
office yesterday, weren't you?

116
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:40,136
What were you there for?

117
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:43,573
Principal's office? I didn't go there.

118
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,734
That can't be.

119
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,811
What's wrong?

120
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,882
I'm sorry, I...

121
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:54,476
really don't know.

122
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,218
Don't know?

123
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,491
The trace of the Seed is gone.

124
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:15,841
Miss Taeko isn't here yet.

125
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:20,245
You guys go back to class.
I'll watch over him.

126
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:25,450
Miyuri, you want to be alone
with Tamura, don't you?

127
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:30,455
Come to think of it,
you've always looked up to Tamura.

128
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:33,458
That's not it! He needs someone to watch.

129
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:38,520
Let's leave these two
young ones to themselves.

130
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:40,497
Come on, quit joking!

131
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:54,770
Let's leave it to the nurse specialist.

132
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,142
Nurse specialist?

133
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:59,785
No worries. Undivided attention
and devoted nursing...

134
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:03,489
they are the perfect medicine for princes.

135
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:04,545
That's right.

136
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:09,092
I hope that Miyuri and Tamura
both get along well.

137
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:11,791
So do I.

138
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,790
Prince...

139
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,661
Please stop it, Tamura.

140
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:31,983
I like you, Tamura.

141
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:35,577
But this. Not like this!

142
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:51,460
It hurts!

143
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:23,168
No, don't stop now, Tamura!

144
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:26,032
Make me feel even better. Please!

145
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:31,568
I'll make you feel better.

146
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,703
If you become one of us,
then I promise I will.

147
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:40,375
I will, so hurry!

148
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,060
Chihaya...

149
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:55,233
are you sure it's okay
not for you to go home with Natsuki?

150
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,602
He could rot and die, for all I care!

151
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,195
Natsuki, you liar!

152
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:01,498
I don't hear anything!

153
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:04,438
Lovers can hear each other's hearts my ass!

154
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,577
Chihaya?

155
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,373
My ride has arrived,
so I must be going. See you later.

156
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:14,118
I'll see you tomorrow, Sayaka!

157
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:17,279
Goodbye, Chihaya.

158
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,447
Bye-bye.

159
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,520
Now, then.

160
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,065
Chihaya.

161
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:33,798
Is it okay for us to stop
by Angel Kiss now?

162
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,040
That would happen to be a date?

163
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:45,980
That was a bit nosy of me
to ask something like that!

164
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:52,714
Man, why did Chihaya go home
by herself without me?

165
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:57,924
Emi?

166
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:01,827
Natsuki.

167
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:03,329
What's wrong?

168
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:08,700
Natsuki, I'm scared, I'm frightened!

169
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,905
What's going on?

170
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:21,750
This is the first time Angel Kiss's
been full at this time of day!

171
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:24,616
Chihaya! How are you?

172
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:26,622
You came home at the right time!

173
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:30,157
It got crowded all of a sudden,
and we're just so busy!

174
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,626
Come on and help us.

175
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:32,696
Where's Mama?

176
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:36,701
She said that she's going to the National
Family Restaurant Association meeting...

177
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:39,067
and won't be back until nightfall.

178
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,470
I got it. I'll go change, then.

179
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,112
Hey, Sai, Miyuri's on her first date,
so take care of them!

180
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,171
Okay!

181
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:58,180
Magical Kanan!

182
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,791
I can leave that on!

183
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:14,271
Okay!

184
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,529
Perfect!

185
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:20,469
Time to head back to Angel Kiss!

186
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,893
Tomoe! Sai! Ayumi!

187
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:43,624
Miyuri!

188
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:47,269
Tamura, you too?

189
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:53,401
Don't worry, they'll all feel
good soon enough.

190
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:57,572
I can't remember anything.

191
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:02,680
Another me is doing
something I don't know.

192
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:09,050
I'm losing my own self.

193
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:11,385
Emi.

194
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:17,526
Miyuri, that isn't...

195
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,809
Miyuri, stop it!

196
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:26,868
Please!

197
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:31,306
No! Stop it!

198
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:34,876
No! Not that!

199
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,415
Mayumi...

200
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:43,259
I'll make it feel all better.

201
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:49,334
No stop it help me.

202
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:51,932
Please help.

203
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:56,334
Help me! Natsuki!

204
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:01,602
Chihaya.

205
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:07,551
Natsuki?

206
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:10,119
Emi, I'm sorry, I have to go...

207
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:13,022
I'm sorry!

208
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,150
Wait, Natsuki, please!

209
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:24,869
That voice was definitely Chihaya's.

210
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:27,434
That was Chihaya's voice.

211
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:29,035
Chihaya's in danger!

212
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:30,766
Chihaya!

213
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:37,806
No!

214
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:40,813
No, stop! Help me, Natsuki.

215
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:44,983
Chihaya!

216
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:53,963
Natsuki?

217
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:56,761
Chihaya!

218
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:57,891
Natsuki!

219
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:01,401
Let go of Chihaya!

220
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:03,140
Natsuki!

221
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,438
What was that?

222
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:18,047
Yes! More! Harder!

223
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:24,454
Yeah! Deeper! Fuck me deeper!

224
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:30,792
More! Harder! Harder!

225
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:34,471
It's out of control.
They're all affected by the Seeds.

226
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:36,298
That's right.

227
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:39,542
Emi!

228
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:43,141
I had everyone become my friend.

229
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,549
No way.

230
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:58,887
I'll make you our friends as well.

231
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:01,558
Miyuri!

232
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:06,261
Miyuri, you can't!

233
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,028
Stop it!

234
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:19,773
What?

235
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:24,579
Really, you're so careless.

236
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:29,188
Cerulean Blue Eco.

237
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:30,853
No you don't!

238
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:33,054
Look out!

239
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:38,058
Hazuna!

240
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:41,405
Master Hazuna!

241
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:42,663
Get them!

242
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:47,067
Damn it!

243
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,683
No!

244
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:01,025
Cerulean Blue! Damn it, let go!

245
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,084
No, stop it!

246
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:32,055
Sayaka?

247
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:34,558
Sayaka's Hazuna's partner?

248
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,426
Humans are so weak.

249
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:39,326
What?

250
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:43,491
Take a good look at those who have
lost themselves in ecstasy!

251
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,507
The Seeds stimulate human emotion.

252
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:55,113
You give them an inch of ecstasy,
and this is what they become.

253
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,846
That is what humans are. Truly.

254
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:01,744
Chihaya!

255
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,893
See the power of the Seeds?

256
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:19,593
She is already a slave of ecstasy.

257
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:22,274
Chihaya.

258
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:29,514
I am your dear opponent, Natsuki.

259
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,120
You seem really happy again.

260
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:42,182
Stop it.

261
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:47,188
Chihaya.

262
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:49,994
Don't worry.

263
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:53,394
Your partner is feeling better by the minute.

264
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:24,827
Chihaya.

265
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:36,237
Natsuki.

266
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:47,850
Unforgivable!

267
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:51,463
I'm not going to forgive you!

268
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:59,937
Natsuki, transformation!

269
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:03,130
Yeah!

270
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:36,574
No way! She beat the powers of the Seed?

271
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:38,700
The flame of truth, hope, and dreams!

272
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,975
Magical Angel, Carmine!

273
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,390
Carmine!

274
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,786
Eco! Shower!

275
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,739
Curse you!

276
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:19,483
Septem! You stepped on the feelings
of Miyuri toward Tamura.

277
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:21,886
You played with everyone's hearts!

278
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:23,318
I will never!

279
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:24,387
Ever!

280
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,681
Forgive you!

281
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:45,967
I'm home.

282
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:48,368
My.

283
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:50,807
Everyone's napping together?

284
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:59,289
Did you really hear my voice?

285
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:03,027
- Yeah.
- I heard it too.

286
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:05,121
Your voice.

287
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:13,360
I guess people who love each
other can hear their hearts.

288
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:20,134
I've decided to do it.

289
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:22,102
Sex.

290
00:23:24,616 --> 00:23:27,585
I want to become stronger.

291
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,787
So that I can protect everyone
and their feelings.

292
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:34,823
If our relationship grows deeper,
Carmine will be stronger too.

293
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:38,786
Well, yeah, but...

294
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:40,655
Aren't you happy?

295
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:42,299
I'm happy.

296
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:44,295
I'm happy, but...

297
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,505
It's like I'm forcing you out
of duty to do so.

298
00:23:48,006 --> 00:23:49,473
I figured it out!

299
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:52,910
When you came to save me, I was so happy.

300
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:56,204
I figured out that I love you.

301
00:23:56,782 --> 00:23:57,714
Chihaya.

302
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:00,951
Natsuki, give me your power.

303
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:03,854
And look at only me.

304
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:46,029
Natsuki, I'm so embarrassed.

305
00:24:58,377 --> 00:24:59,639
Natsuki!

306
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:04,809
I can't...

307
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:08,214
I can't wait any longer.

308
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:53,758
Carmine is fine, now.

309
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:55,565
Let's go.

310
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:57,935
Yes, Master Hazuna.

311
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,831
It's not over yet.

312
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:08,878
True.

313
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:11,109
It has only begun.

314
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:13,811
Isn't that right?

315
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,780
Master Bergamot.

316
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:26,987
Natsuki.

317
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,122
Chihaya.

318
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,686
God, you made me transform! You idiot!

319
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,884
You're the one who kissed me!

320
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:59,121
No, you did!

321
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:01,425
No, it was you!

322
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:05,026
It was in such a good mood.

323
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:08,105
Stupid! Stupid! Natsuki!

324
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:46,170
So what're going to do now?

325
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:49,367
Well, let's see...

326
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:51,072
Let's do it again!
