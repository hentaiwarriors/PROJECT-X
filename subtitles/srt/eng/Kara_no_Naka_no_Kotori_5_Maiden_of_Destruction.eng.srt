1
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:28,571
Based on these materials...

2
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:32,401
...I can't help but tell you that
this business plan is reckless.

3
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,002
I think we need more time...

4
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:40,245
...to develop such a huge
railroad construction plan.

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,120
I'm concerned if we
even get the permission.

6
00:00:46,057 --> 00:00:50,084
We should examine this
plan once more, shouldn't we?

7
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,858
I would like to hear your opinion.

8
00:00:57,235 --> 00:01:02,172
You've become smart enough
to talk back to me, haven't you?

9
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:04,198
Mr. Perkins.

10
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:07,641
You guys, too.

11
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,746
When did Barton's
executives become so cowardly?

12
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:17,486
We have overcome this
kind of risk many times so far.

13
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:20,156
There is no mistake in my plan.

14
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:24,684
Just consider how to carry it out properly.

15
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:29,898
Do it like you have done so far.

16
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:37,135
The flightless birds' lament...

17
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,106
Why is it so difficult to grip
something with their hands?

18
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:45,147
Why is it so difficult to walk?

19
00:01:46,284 --> 00:01:49,879
Because they are born to fly.

20
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:53,519
They don't know how
beautiful their feathers are...

21
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:56,218
...and they are afraid of
spreading their wings.

22
00:01:57,228 --> 00:02:00,254
If so, I will make
them open their wings...

23
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:02,388
...by humiliating them...

24
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:06,469
...in order to let them dance.

25
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:39,168
Stop, stop it.

26
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:40,169
No!

27
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:41,764
Stop tickling me!

28
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:45,398
Hey, stop it!

29
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:46,472
No!

30
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:49,572
You are lucky.

31
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:53,372
What are you doing?

32
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:57,515
I told you not to bring
a dog in the mansion.

33
00:02:58,456 --> 00:02:59,218
We are sorry.

34
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:01,189
It's just a dog.

35
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:04,884
He got wet in the rain and looks pitiful.

36
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:10,059
And he is like me...

37
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:11,795
...lonely.

38
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,394
What are you talking about?

39
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,563
You are not alone.

40
00:03:17,074 --> 00:03:18,302
You have us.

41
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:20,201
That's right.

42
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,850
Well, I will overlook it for today.

43
00:03:32,823 --> 00:03:34,290
Don't tell the master.

44
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:35,792
Yes!

45
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:40,088
Thank you very much.

46
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:44,391
You're very kind, aren't you, Foster?

47
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:45,432
Don't be impudent.

48
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:49,067
It is my job to make you happy.

49
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:50,769
Yeah, yeah...

50
00:03:59,216 --> 00:03:59,944
Excuse me.

51
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:20,067
Mr. Dred.

52
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,103
Fahm...

53
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:34,847
Fahm, I am the master of this castle.

54
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:37,244
I will protect you definitely!

55
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:40,483
Why do you look so sad?

56
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,793
Why didn't you protect me back then?

57
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:47,923
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:51,360
There was no way
to disobey my father.

59
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:57,400
I couldn't help accepting my father's
opinion that we weren't a good match...

60
00:04:57,942 --> 00:05:00,502
...because you were a servant.

61
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:02,942
But he is gone.

62
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:07,342
Nobody will disagree with me.

63
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:09,884
It's too late now.

64
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:11,151
It's too late...

65
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,423
Fahm, Fahm, Fahm!

66
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:24,598
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:25,636 --> 00:05:26,830
I woke you up.

68
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:29,495
Never mind.

69
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:34,036
If I take a rest, the development of
railroad construction will be delayed.

70
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:39,649
I'd like to say
smoothing about the plan.

71
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:45,454
Are you going to say
the plan is reckless, too?

72
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:47,688
No, I'm not...

73
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:53,123
I'm just worried about your health.

74
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:56,591
Tell me if you have
something in your mind.

75
00:05:57,835 --> 00:05:58,529
Yes...

76
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:02,604
Your conglomerate has
already grown big enough...

77
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,805
...and acquired so
much fortune and power...

78
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:07,610
...so what more do you need?

79
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:09,975
It seems like...

80
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:12,874
Seems like what?

81
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:18,617
Seems like you are
cornered by something.

82
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:28,792
Give me a break.

83
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:30,461
I am sorry.

84
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,598
That's enough.

85
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:34,565
You're dismissed.

86
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:42,171
What else?

87
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:45,342
You are tired.

88
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:49,046
Please take a rest today.

89
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:53,518
Please let me give you comfort.

90
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:57,121
I'm not tired.

91
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:00,522
Don't worry.

92
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:07,292
I can't replace Fahm, can I?

93
00:07:12,076 --> 00:07:14,340
Why don't you understand?

94
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:21,209
I love Mr. Dred so much.

95
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:24,279
Myuha, you are...

96
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:42,473
Hey, hurry up!

97
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:43,371
Wait for me!
Hey, hurry up!

98
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,346
Understand, Perkins?

99
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:51,112
Yes, sir.

100
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:53,311
Chairman, please take care of yourself.

101
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:54,383
Yes.

102
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:06,955
How long do you want to bow to him?

103
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:12,332
You are going to ignore his
tyrannical behavior, aren't you?

104
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:13,628
No...

105
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:16,563
The union is getting stronger recently.

106
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:20,975
I'm afraid that Burton Company
will break down if you leave him alone.

107
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:23,036
Although you say that...

108
00:08:24,114 --> 00:08:25,877
I have an idea.

109
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:29,583
If you value your lives you have now...

110
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,417
...please come together
to my room this afternoon.

111
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:42,322
Hold!

112
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:44,458
What's going on?

113
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:47,371
Don't be so stingy.

114
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:48,804
Hey, guys.
Don't be so stingy.

115
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:49,273
Give me something.

116
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:50,035
Get out of here!
Give me something.

117
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,731
Com'on!

118
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:52,104
Beggars.

119
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:53,840
Mister, give me something!

120
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:54,378
Sister, please!

121
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:56,243
Shall I give them small change?
Sister, please!

122
00:08:58,382 --> 00:08:59,974
Uncle, give me some.

123
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,014
Give me money.

124
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:01,742
Whoa!

125
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,350
Please buy my flower.

126
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:06,149
Please buy my flower.

127
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:07,720
Please buy my flower.

128
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:19,096
Such annoying kids.

129
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:25,636
Mr. Dred.

130
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:29,474
Why don't you run away?

131
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:32,105
I'm not a beggar.

132
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,874
Please buy my flower.

133
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:35,749
What is your name?

134
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:36,652
What?

135
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:42,955
I am Cherry.

136
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:45,223
Nice to meet you!

137
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:48,865
Take care of this girl.

138
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:51,924
She is too young to work for us.

139
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,369
Make her handle chores.

140
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:55,731
Yes.

141
00:10:02,012 --> 00:10:03,536
I'm Ren, nice to meet you.

142
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:05,409
Oh, you are so dirty.

143
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:07,541
Let's take a bath right now.

144
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:10,351
Who will host my guest today?

145
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:11,480
Aisha will.

146
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:13,445
Okay.

147
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:15,921
Foster...

148
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:21,162
I'm wrestling with a big development
project like nothing I have ever tried.

149
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:26,231
So, I will have a lot of chances to
entertain important clients from now on.

150
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:30,032
Please take care of them very well.

151
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:33,303
Yes, please don't worry.

152
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:36,612
By the way, I have a question.

153
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:37,679
What?

154
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,141
She looks like a girl
who lives in a poor hamlet.

155
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,410
Why did you bring her here?

156
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:48,222
It was a momentary caprice.

157
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:53,222
Anything else?

158
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:55,998
No, excuse me.

159
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:18,279
Washing is one of our important jobs.

160
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:23,723
And don't forget to use clothes pins!

161
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:39,531
Thank you, Cherry.

162
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:46,873
Wow!

163
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:48,208
Stop it, Cherry.

164
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:49,844
All right.

165
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:53,952
You'd better take a rest.

166
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,030
Yes, don't move.

167
00:12:06,637 --> 00:12:07,604
Feels good, doesn't it?

168
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:08,630
Good boy.

169
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:27,722
Can I go in?

170
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:30,156
No, Why don't you run along?

171
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:25,372
Are you drinking in the kitchen?

172
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,474
I am sure I prohibited you to drink.

173
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:30,612
Just one glass.

174
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:33,419
Today's client was very demanding.

175
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:35,352
I'm so tired.

176
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:38,024
I haven't forced you.

177
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:40,961
You hoped for that, didn't you?

178
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:43,289
Why did you say it like that!

179
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:46,065
Can't you say
anything good to me?

180
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:49,996
You did a good job.

181
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:54,610
You could give me
more affectionate words.

182
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,871
You are very important to me.

183
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:00,643
Not like that.

184
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,520
I don't need those words.

185
00:14:07,724 --> 00:14:08,520
You are drunk.

186
00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:10,154
Go to bed.

187
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:13,853
The client...

188
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:16,657
...wanted to take care of me.

189
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:20,126
He said he really loved me.

190
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:23,166
Is that so...

191
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:25,300
Congratulations.

192
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:40,148
You are tired.

193
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:41,386
Go to bed.

194
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:45,386
Mr. Foster, Mr. Foster!

195
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:46,922
Mr. Foster!

196
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:49,955
What is going on so late?

197
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:51,063
Ren is...

198
00:14:51,802 --> 00:14:52,564
Ren is...

199
00:14:58,008 --> 00:14:59,373
Ren, Ren!

200
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,277
The dog went out of the mansion.

201
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:05,876
Ren tried to catch him, but...

202
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,912
Ren, let's go back.

203
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:09,348
You'll catch cold.

204
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:19,458
Why donнt we go look for him?

205
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:23,365
I guess he hasn't gone far away.

206
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:25,031
What do you think?

207
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:28,603
We don't have to.

208
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:30,071
What?

209
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,003
Ren, why?

210
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:33,537
Why do you say that?

211
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,710
He went back to his home.

212
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:40,945
I'm sure he went back to his home.

213
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:43,011
So...

214
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:49,254
I want to go home, too.

215
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,558
Ren!

216
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:52,556
Ren, are you okay?

217
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:53,592
Ren, Ren!

218
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:05,537
Is she better?

219
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:08,634
Yes, but she still has fever.

220
00:16:09,513 --> 00:16:10,309
Is that so...

221
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,673
She got a shock, didn't she?

222
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:17,415
Give her some rest until the fever leaves her.

223
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:19,019
Yes.

224
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,153
Daddy, Mummy...

225
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:29,863
I'm afraid of Father.

226
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,828
Don't say that.

227
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:35,062
Your father is really a very kind person.

228
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:37,532
Why does he treat you coldly?

229
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:42,243
It's my fault, so don't be spiteful of him.

230
00:17:58,455 --> 00:17:59,217
Did you call for me?

231
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:00,983
Yes, come in.

232
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:08,120
Take her away.

233
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:09,360
What?

234
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:18,473
Clair.

235
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:19,207
Yes.

236
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:22,575
I decided to throw a party in ten days.

237
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:24,438
Yes, sir.

238
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:28,914
By the way, it's been
a while since Ren was ill in bed.

239
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:30,517
How is she doing?

240
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:31,712
Actually...

241
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:33,847
...it's not good.

242
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:35,349
Is that so...

243
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:39,862
It doesn't make sense
to keep her in this mansion.

244
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:40,991
What?

245
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:42,326
You mean...

246
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,290
Are you going to let her go?

247
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:49,037
She doesn't have
anybody she can count on.

248
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:51,472
Are you sure of driving her out?

249
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:53,934
Clair, stop it.

250
00:18:56,112 --> 00:18:57,044
Please give me an answer!

251
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:00,743
This is business.

252
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:04,543
Do you think only about business?

253
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:08,923
Don't you have a heart?

254
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,952
How about my mother?

255
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:17,529
Why did you treat her so
badly when she was sick?

256
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:19,026
Shut up!

257
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:26,667
Stop!

258
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,372
Stop, Father!

259
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:33,147
Don't hurt Mommy anymore!

260
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:47,923
They will go wrong if left as they are.

261
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:51,862
I told you I was facing
a very crucial moment.

262
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:55,928
I don't have time
to worry about the maids.

263
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,737
However, Clair is
your daughter, isn't she?

264
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:06,915
I haven't talked to you about
why I hired you in the first place.

265
00:20:10,954 --> 00:20:16,324
Her mother, Fahm,
called your name before she died.

266
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:19,928
After you ran away...

267
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:24,766
...I brought her back from
the authorities to this mansion...

268
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:28,659
...but she didn't love me any more.

269
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:35,137
I got you here in order
to take revenge on you a little.

270
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:55,723
Are you all right?

271
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:00,828
Mom told me not to have
a grudge against my father.

272
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:03,731
I don't know.

273
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:11,237
What happened between
Father, Mother, and you?

274
00:21:19,556 --> 00:21:24,459
I met Fahm more than ten years ago.

275
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:29,990
I used to a member of a political party.

276
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:33,559
I met her there.

277
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:39,971
I remember my mother
disappeared suddenly when I was little.

278
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:43,339
Maybe at that time...

279
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:47,746
Fahm was so attractive.

280
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:54,448
I fell in love with her
at a first sight and won her.

281
00:21:56,893 --> 00:22:00,329
I flattered myself, thinking I could
control the government as I hoped.

282
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:04,624
Fahm and I loved each other.

283
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:07,793
But...

284
00:22:08,638 --> 00:22:12,130
...some scandals were revealed
and the party was disbanded.

285
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:15,439
And I was wanted by the authorities.

286
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:21,239
At that time, I
abandoned Fahm and ran away.

287
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,614
I didn't understand how
deep Fahm loved me in those days.

288
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:34,222
Until I came to this mansion, I didn't
realize that how deep her love was...

289
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:37,622
...nor Dred's true nature.

290
00:22:39,435 --> 00:22:41,699
I understand you hate Dred.

291
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:46,632
But Dred loved you and Fahm
from the bottom of his heart.

292
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:51,871
Only if I didn't approach her...

293
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:55,180
Please tell me one thing.

294
00:22:56,386 --> 00:23:01,517
Mr. Foster, you treat me
kindly because I look like Mother?

295
00:23:03,326 --> 00:23:04,691
You must be kidding.

296
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,239
Good morning, sir.

297
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:32,045
As you understand, today's
party is especially important.

298
00:23:34,257 --> 00:23:36,191
Take care not to be impolite!

299
00:23:37,193 --> 00:23:37,557
Yes!

300
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:03,444
Are you all right?

301
00:24:04,153 --> 00:24:04,619
Yes.

302
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:06,985
Although I feel dizzy a little bit.

303
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:08,824
Don't overwork.

304
00:24:11,294 --> 00:24:11,885
Thank you.

305
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,253
Cherry, Ren, quit playing around.

306
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:40,615
Yes.

307
00:24:42,825 --> 00:24:43,792
Those two...

308
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:48,060
This is amazing.

309
00:24:49,432 --> 00:24:52,526
They are very powerful politicians
and businessmen under their masks.

310
00:24:52,802 --> 00:24:53,393
Really?

311
00:24:54,938 --> 00:24:57,930
This party shows what an
influential person Mr. Dred is.

312
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,479
Thank you for coming...

313
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:10,377
...to our company's new
business announcement party...

314
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:11,454
Please.

315
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:11,621
...even though you are busy.
Please.

316
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:12,747
...even though you are busy.

317
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:18,022
Young girl, why don't you come here.

318
00:25:18,695 --> 00:25:19,093
Come on!

319
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:24,193
Excuse me.

320
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:27,597
We have prepared
another lady to service you.

321
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:29,103
Oh, is that so?

322
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:34,402
That's enough of the formal speech.

323
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:39,707
Everybody, please
enjoy this evening completely.

324
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,319
A toast to our country's future.

325
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:49,888
Cheers!

326
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:50,683
Cheers!

327
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:14,683
Leed!

328
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:18,218
I heard you went bankrupt.

329
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:20,383
What kind of scheme are part of now?

330
00:26:23,593 --> 00:26:25,527
I can come back any time.

331
00:26:26,496 --> 00:26:29,192
But I will never forgive Dred.

332
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:32,095
I'll bring about his downfall.

333
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:34,763
With Perkins!

334
00:26:36,005 --> 00:26:36,767
Come to my side.

335
00:26:37,407 --> 00:26:38,669
Join us.

336
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:40,865
And then...

337
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:43,970
Why you laugh?

338
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:49,043
I used to be supported by a
gorgeous vision of the Curey Port...

339
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,980
...but that time has gone already.

340
00:26:53,156 --> 00:26:55,420
Stop sympathizing with yourself.

341
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:57,652
Sympathizing with myself...

342
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:01,054
...no I sympathize with you.

343
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:04,829
Go ahead and keep dancing.

344
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:08,566
Shit!

345
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:50,537
Ladies and gentleman,
sorry to keep you waiting.

346
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,540
This is the main dish for tonight.

347
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:19,771
Please, don't rush.

348
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,007
I will present a great show.

349
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:34,717
His days will be numbered soon.

350
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:40,520
Let's see the big star shining brightly
just before going out, with our own eyes.

351
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:35,006
Oh, you're dripping so much.

352
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:37,578
You're so horny.

353
00:29:52,568 --> 00:29:53,000
What?

354
00:29:58,474 --> 00:29:58,940
I see.

355
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:01,771
Call Perkins to my room.

356
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:03,043
Yes, sir.

357
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:05,805
They are wet enough.

358
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:07,215
Please...

359
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,374
...taste them to your hearts' content.

360
00:30:50,026 --> 00:30:50,685
You're kidding me!

361
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:56,391
The union and the board of
directors have already decided on.

362
00:30:57,066 --> 00:31:01,298
Since when did the board of
directors have the right to talk back to me?

363
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:06,205
Our company's size is too
big for you to control as you like.

364
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:09,609
Please think about this seriously.

365
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:12,406
And then...

366
00:31:13,249 --> 00:31:17,709
...only if you offer us
information you've collected...

367
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:20,452
That's enough.

368
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:21,546
Dismissed!

369
00:31:23,526 --> 00:31:25,687
I see, excuse me.

370
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:32,391
They demanded the
resignation of the master?

371
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:34,065
Yes.

372
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:41,132
Did they kick him out
of the company?

373
00:31:42,478 --> 00:31:46,141
No, but he has no voice
for the company from now on.

374
00:31:49,652 --> 00:31:51,176
Keep this in mind.

375
00:31:52,822 --> 00:31:55,586
I don't think that guy has
the ability to take over Dred's job.

376
00:31:58,094 --> 00:31:58,560
Foster.

377
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:00,955
Please help Dred.

378
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:08,996
I can't do anything for him now.

379
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:31,186
Hey, why don't you join us?

380
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,893
Sir, I am not...

381
00:32:49,612 --> 00:32:52,638
I collected this
information with desperate effort.

382
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:55,441
How can I let them have it so easily?

383
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:07,920
That's it.

384
00:33:14,236 --> 00:33:18,002
Give me any other papers.

385
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:23,436
You decided to
cooperate with Perkins, Mr. Leed?

386
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:30,075
Take it if you want it so much!

387
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,848
Fire, fire broke out!

388
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:14,653
Perkins!

389
00:34:26,842 --> 00:34:27,433
Fahm...

390
00:34:28,844 --> 00:34:31,836
Clair is getting to look like you.

391
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:42,185
Mr. Dred!

392
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:43,221
Stop!

393
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:44,951
It's too late.

394
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:46,961
No...

395
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,802
It's burning.

396
00:34:56,472 --> 00:34:58,770
My house will be burnt up!

397
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:05,713
Dred, Dred...

398
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:25,160
Dred actually loved
you and Fahm very much.

399
00:35:27,136 --> 00:35:27,795
Father...

400
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:15,942
Everything is finally over
and everybody went back home.

401
00:37:18,213 --> 00:37:22,650
Ren went back to her sister, whom
Foster found with a private investigator.

402
00:37:24,353 --> 00:37:28,722
Aisha went with her new
patron who only loves her.

403
00:37:30,426 --> 00:37:32,223
Mother!

404
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:34,153
Leese went back to her family.

405
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:42,003
An old couple in a
town took care of Cherry.

406
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:44,731
And for me...

407
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:46,800
There's no place...

408
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:51,004
...for me to stay
except this burnt up mansion.

409
00:37:57,686 --> 00:37:58,175
But...

410
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:00,347
I am not lonely...

411
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,684
...anymore.
