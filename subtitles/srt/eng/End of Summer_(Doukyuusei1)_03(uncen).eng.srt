1
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,480
Sachi. Your breast turns big recently

2
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,690
Let me see

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,690
Don't!

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,280
No, I can't

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,740
Mai isn't here, really

6
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,990
How's that?

7
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,000
Satomi

8
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,330
How long do you need to peep?

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,750
This behavior is so bad!

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,920
Satomi You are just the same

11
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,090
You can't forget him. So you come to school?

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,430
Him?

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,850
You mean Keinze?

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,560
Wrong

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,690
I forgot him, so I come here

16
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,600
Satomi

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,030
Satomi Seems to have forgotten him

18
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,740
Look at yourself again

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,490
Can't forget Mai

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,960
"Doukyuusei - Chapter 3"

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,550
"At the end of summer time"

22
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,680
Welcome!

23
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,560
Very hot!

24
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,230
Boss, I'll have a cup of cold coffee

25
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,730
Okay

26
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,820
Welcome!

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,650
Wataru, too much coffee isn't good to the stomach

28
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,450
Don't worry

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,490
My mind is bad but my stomach is good

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,500
Okay! Yes!

31
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,370
You have usual meals three times a day?

32
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,790
Summer posses soon, it's good to eat more

33
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,210
Weclome!

34
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,340
What! Satomi suppose to know much

35
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,220
She is so mature, cheerful as well

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,010
Really can't imagine before

37
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,060
I am worried of a thing for a certain time

38
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,310
Do you know that?

39
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,900
I beg you

40
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,190
Help me forget him

41
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,900
I can?

42
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,120
Only can help me

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,950
Wataru

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,500
Are you thinking of something?

45
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,920
No!

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,590
Something did happen

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,170
No, no big deal!

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,510
But Satomi has grown up and mature

49
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,800
Yes

50
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,010
Hey! Wataru

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,730
Satomi needs to keep operating
the coffee shop after graduation

52
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,860
I heard that, so touching

53
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,150
Boss, no need to exaggerate

54
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,780
How's that?

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,280
Nothing

56
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,530
Satomi, you are so cheerful,
I am so glad

57
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,580
Boss, coffee, hot tea, one for each

58
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,830
Also two yogurt cakes

59
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,370
Yes, starts working now

60
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,170
Satomi, have you got a boyfriend?

61
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,300
I won't abandon Wataru who is too slow

62
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,510
Hey! Satomi, you mean who?

63
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,100
Stupid

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,400
Satomi, that girl,
I ain't so slow

65
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,610
Thanks!

66
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,530
Please come again!

67
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,490
Bad, it's Miho

68
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,040
It's bad!

69
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,590
Wataru?

70
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,840
It's really you!

71
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,300
This is. Please take this letter

72
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,510
Miho

73
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,390
Sorry

74
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,190
Don't look over here, I feel sorry

75
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,240
I know that

76
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,030
I'll return here again, I gotta go

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,820
Wataru

78
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,410
Wataru, what's the thing between
you and Misa?

79
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,510
Please reply

80
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Sure something happens

81
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,430
Miho, I have something to do

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,640
I gotta go.

83
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,400
It's really troublesome!

84
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,990
Shit! So careless

85
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,450
Really sorry!

86
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,080
Here is?

87
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,120
What's this?

88
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,000
Sorry

89
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,440
Mai!

90
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,860
Mai, I haven't forgotten

91
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,610
the engagement that we are go to the playground

92
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,540
Sorry

93
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,500
Mai!

94
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:02,750
Mai!

95
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,550
It's Keinze!

96
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,180
Mai!

97
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,180
Youthful!

98
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,810
Katsuya

99
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,770
Ten days later summer is over

100
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,690
I need to keep my body fit

101
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,780
So that won't lose to anyone

102
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,530
You seem energetic

103
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,040
I can observe

104
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,250
You and Kurumi, still in good condition?

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,710
Kurumi? I won't keep in touch with that child

106
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,510
I go out with women who are mature

107
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,060
I can't understand that kind of child

108
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,770
I now go with a beauty who is recognized

109
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,900
A recognized beauty?

110
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,160
Natsuko! Katsuya comes back!

111
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,580
Thanks! Makes you tired!

112
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,920
What to do next?

113
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,470
Who is this?

114
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,100
He is Wataru

115
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,220
Wataru?

116
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,710
Wataru, what's up?

117
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,930
What's up? Got sun-stroke?

118
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,300
No, nothing

119
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,220
Natsuko

120
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,850
At this time, Natsuko's pretty shadow

121
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,810
It's so shiny!

122
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,150
See? I didn't lie.

123
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,030
Natsuko has a mature charm

124
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,110
What happened, Wataru?

125
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,740
No, nothing

126
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,660
Isn't it? That's good

127
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,910
You envy me?

128
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,130
I can see Natsuko everyday.

129
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,880
Once is good

130
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,130
I want to make love with Natsuki

131
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,470
Wataru

132
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,640
I'll tell you next time, the process between Natsuko and me

133
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,680
I gotta go now!

134
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,440
He really knows how to enjoy

135
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,650
Kurumi

136
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,820
What's up, Kurumi?

137
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,200
Katsuya... Katsuya...

138
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,290
A woman who is older than Katsuya?

139
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,670
Yes, he hung up suddenly...

140
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,090
I dialed three times, and still can't connect

141
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,840
Can't connect?

142
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,010
Really no method

143
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,430
Kurumi, he goes with the girl in the boutique

144
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
No, he won't!

145
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,680
What do I have to do?

146
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,810
Don't worry, Katsuya is busy at the shop only

147
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,770
No!

148
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,030
He invited me several times to the motel, but I refused

149
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,360
So...

150
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,110
What should we do?

151
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,700
You really Katsuya?

152
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,660
Really! Really!

153
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,580
Follow his request, go there once!

154
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,590
Men! Loving one woman requires you to think!

155
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,930
Wataru, you better not teach Kurumi something bad

156
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,350
I haven't said anything

157
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,770
Kurumi, women's precious thing.

158
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,310
don't pay any costs casually

159
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,990
I know, Kurumi won't pay any costs casually.

160
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,530
I grant my heart to Katsuya

161
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Don't be so loud

162
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,290
Sorry

163
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,040
I decided it! But a bit afraid

164
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,510
Wataru, can you help me now?

165
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,630
Me?

166
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,810
Really

167
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,770
Why I must do something for them?

168
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,820
Come on, Kurumi, show your courage

169
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Kurumi?

170
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,860
Yes, she is so serious

171
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,830
Give women's precious thing to me?

172
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,700
It is quite right

173
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,500
Really?

174
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,630
If really so

175
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,590
So I suggest you dating with her

176
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,840
Excellent!

177
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,310
Enter, Kurumi, hurry

178
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,310
We already been to here

179
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,270
Work harder!

180
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,480
Hurry, enter there!

181
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,020
Kurumi!

182
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,020
Wataru!

183
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,240
What happened, Kurumi?

184
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,110
Katsuya went too far

185
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,240
He said he doesn't like me

186
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,540
He doesn't want to see me anymore.

187
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,080
You went out with him recently, right?

188
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,790
Still it isn't okay

189
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,590
I've been to entrance of the motel,
but I was afraid

190
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,430
You ran out, right?

191
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,550
Yes!

192
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,600
What should I do?

193
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,640
Katsuya really hates me a lot!

194
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,810
Don't worry

195
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,320
Men's likeness or not is not superficial

196
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,820
Katsuya that quy!
Saying too excessively!

197
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,290
C'mon! Do whatever you like!

198
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,210
Let me be an adult

199
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,960
How... how could it be?

200
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,460
Please!

201
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,420
Do you want to go to that hotel?

202
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,140
Just joking

203
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,640
Kurumi won't do such thing.

204
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,220
Let's go together

205
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,980
Please!

206
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,900
Hey! Kurumi, please wait

207
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,280
Let's forget it

208
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,280
Dad said

209
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,120
This kind of place is where adults come

210
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,670
From now on,
I have to be an adult

211
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,500
Let's go!

212
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,300
I get it! I understand!

213
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,560
It's really a little different

214
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,010
What's the different?

215
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,230
He is not as gentle as Wataru

216
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,150
Take a rest or stay for the night?

217
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,530
Decide quickly!

218
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,820
Taking rest is fine.

219
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,530
Resting is 1 hour

220
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,330
It looks nice inside

221
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,670
Kurumi

222
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,170
Wataru

223
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,470
Kurumi, you're so cute

224
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,550
Wataru

225
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,700
What?

226
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,200
Sor... sorry, I don't mean it

227
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,540
Really no solution

228
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,750
Sor... sorry

229
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,800
Kurumi, let's go back!

230
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,390
No! Wataru have to help me to become an adult

231
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,720
But, if we do so...

232
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,230
Otherwise, tie me up will be OK

233
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,770
Although you say so, but there's no rope

234
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,900
Do you need rope?

235
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,280
Even have such thing?

236
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,120
You want rope?

237
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,950
There're golden, silver and common, three kinds

238
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,580
Three kinds?

239
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,210
Which kind would you like?
You can pay the bill when you're back

240
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,670
Since we've be here, let's go wildly, use the golden

241
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,630
I want the golden one
I want the silver

242
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,720
You just left with the common rope

243
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,180
Wataru, tie me with the rope quickly

244
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,980
No! Still not good

245
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,440
You said no now?

246
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,650
Wataru! Be quick!

247
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,690
No!

248
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,530
Then it's OK now!

249
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,950
Kurumi

250
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:06,880
No!

251
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,540
No!

252
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,840
No! Still not! Stop quickly!

253
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,180
No! I'm afraid!

254
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,480
No! No! Wataru!

255
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,520
If you move carelessly this way, the dress will be wrecked

256
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,080
Kurumi hates Wataru who does such thing

257
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,460
If you detest, you won't come here

258
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,340
But I still can't

259
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,670
Even you say can't, you can't help it now.

260
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,310
So then! I can only...

261
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,810
Don't act so

262
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,350
just as I like, it's what you said

263
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,440
Don't be like that! Release me quickly,
Wataru

264
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,740
No!

265
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,570
It's you who wants me to do so

266
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,700
Don't be self-witted

267
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,700
I'm very self-witted?

268
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,080
Yes! Katsuya also said that

269
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,010
Kurumi, sorry, I don't mean other things

270
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,720
Let's go back, I release the rope for you now

271
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,850
Don't release it!

272
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,650
Don't release it, Wataru

273
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,480
just leave it like that

274
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,610
Please

275
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,660
Wataru

276
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,410
Kurumi

277
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,910
Teach me about the things which is forbidden

278
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,540
Please

279
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,350
No!

280
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,560
Wataru!

281
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,940
You have the feelings?

282
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,610
No!

283
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,520
I? No!

284
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,350
So cute!

285
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,520
Kurumi, you're so sensitive!

286
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,820
Don't say it, OK?
I fell so embarrassing

287
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,900
Even more like a child

288
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,540
Kurumi

289
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,590
Wataru, I like you.
I like you so much

290
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,420
Me too

291
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,970
No! I'm so shy! Stop!

292
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,780
Kurumi, what's the matter?

293
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,070
I don't know, I don't knew even myself!

294
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,740
I just want to be an adult quickly, please.

295
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,390
My body can feel it

296
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,690
I still can't touch the most sensitive place of Kurumi

297
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,110
Wataru, don't just keep saying, touch quickly!

298
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,450
Can't be that

299
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,290
Kurumi, so great!

300
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,290
No, don't come in, but it feels so good

301
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,300
Wataru

302
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,180
I have a strange feeling again, so...

303
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,810
Is it OK, now?

304
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,070
Stop!

305
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,490
Are you OK?

306
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,120
Don't stop! I want to be an adult quickly

307
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,680
Kurumi, I like you

308
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,680
No!

309
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,060
What's wrong? Feel pain?

310
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,440
A little bit, but don't know what will be?

311
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,360
What should I do?
What will I turn to be?

312
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,070
Kurumi's future will be very wonderful

313
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,280
No!

314
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,370
Still like before?

315
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,750
But, it's much greater than before

316
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,260
Kurumi is very afraid

317
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:40,060
No! No! But it's very comfortable

318
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,870
Help me! Just as I'm torn

319
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,420
Wataru! Wataru!

320
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,960
I don't want it now, don't know which kind of feeling it is.

321
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,260
Doesn't matter

322
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,760
Don't stop! Wataru! Please!

323
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,670
Wataru, here is OK

324
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,000
Kurumi, from now I am an adult

325
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,090
But still a bit as a child

326
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,390
Next time, surely I can do it without tying up

327
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,720
Thank you very much

328
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,100
Kurumi!

329
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,190
Wataru, you listen to me?
I'm totally hopeless.

330
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,660
Natsuko, Natsuko said we just be friends.

331
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,880
Really, the best person is the first consideration

332
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,880
Wataru

333
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,220
What's the matter?

334
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,720
Katsuya, he...

335
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,350
Has called many times

336
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,980
Now it's my turn to joke with him

337
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,600
Kurumi!

338
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,110
Really, I am going.

339
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,110
Wait for me! Kurumi!
Wait for me first!

340
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,320
I don't want to

341
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,830
For me? I feel like cheating someone

342
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,040
Also as being confused.
