1
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,957
No!! No!!

2
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,100
Akitoshi, help!!

3
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,842
Akitoshi
Brother!!

4
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,797
Please, stop!

5
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:24,000
Please... help us!!

6
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,083
Brother!! Brother!!

7
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,521
Hold it!!

8
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,827
Let go, or else, I will kill you too.

9
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,732
Brother!

10
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,129
Brother, Ple...

11
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,635
Shit!

12
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:34,338
Shit! Give everyone back! Give everyone back!

13
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,655
Fall with us...

14
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:01,639
Are you already finished?
Did you really believe us?

15
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:06,509
What an idiot.
You are not our friend.

16
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,103
Brother
Akitoshi!

17
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:12,618
Brother, come with us.
It feels good.

18
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:17,343
Sexy Magical Girl Ai

19
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,124
We won't hurt you.
Take if off yourself.

20
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,397
She really did take em' off.

21
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,064
She is a slut.

22
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,845
Wha? Who the fuck are you?

23
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,049
He, help me!

24
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,657
Please help me!

25
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,835
Fucker, what are you doing!?

26
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,669
You are hella creepy.

27
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,068
What? You wanna fight?

28
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,912
Don't fuck with us!

29
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,239
Yua Attack, good to go!

30
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,903
You idiot!

31
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:53,910
Yeah!

32
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,373
Are you trying to kill me every morning? Besides...

33
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,410
just because we've been friends since childhood, doesn't
mean you should come into a man's room without notice.

34
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,421
Why?

35
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,055
You are so air-headed.

36
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,593
Hurry, lets eat breakfast.

37
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:13,197
Ouch... what a morning to follow that dream.

38
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,161
What kind of dream?

39
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,430
Well... erm...

40
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,672
You made me forget...

41
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,611
Alright, lets try another Yua Attack!

42
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,612
Hold it!

43
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,511
STOP!!!!

44
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,725
Good morning, Chie
Good morning, Yua.

45
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,326
Hi to you to, Sir Akitoshi.

46
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,488
Yeah, good morning.

47
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,396
How was the book?

48
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:53,067
It was great... but, because of it, I had a weird dream.

49
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,235
Oh, so your weird dream is because of Chie.

50
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,373
Yua, do you know that this area is a hot spot for ghosts?

51
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:07,681
Ghosts, zombies, you name it, they are all here.

52
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,348
No, no, no. Chie is trying to scare me again.

53
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,356
Chie, you sure know a lot.

54
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,760
Well, I've always been interested in such things.

55
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,897
So, you're a mystery hunter.

56
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:26,428
Well, I think the rape that's been happening lately is not
done by a human.

57
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,129
What do you mean?

58
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:34,738
I feel that something supernatural is causing all this mess.

59
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,044
Supernatural...

60
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,478
For example... it...

61
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,017
could be behind you...

62
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,697
I'm sorry!

63
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,035
Yua, you're energetic today too.

64
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,877
Mikage is so dark lately.

65
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,011
Sup, Touru.

66
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:18,021
Chie, you picked on me again, didn't you!

67
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,391
Yua, you're such a fraidy cat.

68
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:27,126
I won't forgive you! You are so mean!
Stop it! I said stop it!

69
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:41,274
During one person's life, it is said that there are many who
can change your destiny. I did not believe that.

70
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:50,082
Y, you there! Your skirt is too short!

71
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:56,093
You there, you have permed hair! You also have lipstick
on. Girls these days...

72
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,160
Shit, it's that pervert Mr. Naito checking up on girls again.

73
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,631
He so creeps me out.
He is a loser.

74
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,563
You can go. You're next.

75
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:21,715
Oh no. I feel sad for Mikage.

76
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,782
Hey you!

77
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,320
I'll check you so wait.

78
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:34,355
Don't move... I may touch somewhere I don't want too.

79
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,028
Don't move...

80
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,064
That shit head.

81
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,605
Y, you see. Look at your skirt.

82
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,273
I can't take it!

83
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,443
Brother!

84
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,340
Mr. Naito!

85
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,882
Please check if my undies are in school regulations or not.

86
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,419
That's absurd.

87
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,389
Please take a look, I haven't change a pair in 3 days.

88
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,760
S, stop it! I don't want to see dirty things!

89
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,629
It's not dirty. Here!

90
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,968
I don't want to see guy's.

91
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,170
Teacher, I think that's sexual harassment.

92
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,607
Yeah, yeah. That's right

93
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,711
N, no. I was just checking.

94
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,212
You guys are all late. Go to class!

95
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,890
Great job. It feels great.

96
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,521
Brother, your undies are dirty.

97
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,822
I was just kidding. These are a new pair.

98
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,934
You want to see?
Really!? Show me!

99
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,938
Made you look! What about that... huh?

100
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,403
Yua, how about my undies?

101
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,137
Where did she go?

102
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,144
Lets go, Bro. We're late.

103
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,994
What's wrong?

104
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,858
It's her.

105
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,066
That girl right there, the one Naito was fooling around with.

106
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,263
So, she's a new student.

107
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,800
She's Ai Kagano, she's been with us since first semester

108
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,701
Are you ok, Akitoshi

109
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,540
Huh, really?

110
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,443
Are you ok, Akitoshi?

111
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,413
Class call.
Yes!

112
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:39,557
Stand... bow... sit.

113
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:46,898
You guys probably heard it from the news already, but the
attack happened again last night.

114
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,900
Just a reminder, girls of course and guys...

115
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,098
I don't remember her at all.

116
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,816
Is something... up with me?

117
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,683
Mr. Okajima!

118
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,021
Y, yes!

119
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,682
Repeat what I've just said!

120
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,284
Um... well...

121
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,419
Don't be staring at girls.

122
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,028
Because of you, I got interrupted.

123
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:28,672
We will have a school festival next week. If you're not
working for the festival, please go home right away.

124
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:33,139
Don't be wondering around just because you're not at
school, ok?

125
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:41,916
I don't want the press asking me questions and faking the
sympathy for you guys, understood?

126
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,350
One. Two. One. Two.

127
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:12,646
School is going to close. Any students left on campus,
please go home.

128
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:16,347
When going home, please do not wander around.

129
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,585
Any students left on campus, please...

130
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,986
Finally finished. Shall we go home?

131
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,724
Mikage, do you want to go home together?

132
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,797
Sorry... I have to stop by somewhere.

133
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,700
Don't be wandering around.

134
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,833
Yua Attack!

135
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,235
I'm done.

136
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,010
Can't you say hi to me normally!?

137
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,775
Brother, lets go home.

138
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,750
My mom said to go home with you because it's
dangerous.

139
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,416
See you, Akitoshi.

140
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,482
See you.

141
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,558
Touru, lets go home together.

142
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,694
Sorry, I got to do stuff for the festival. See you, Yua.

143
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,795
Hey... so I have to babysit Yua?

144
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,239
I babysit you.

145
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,711
Hey, hey, lets stop by there.

146
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,278
Hey, we were told to go straight home.

147
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:27,819
Wow. Bro, this is cute!

148
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,495
Buy this please.

149
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,292
Why do I have to buy it?

150
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,958
I always take care of you.

151
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,937
I take care of you!

152
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,017
It's her...

153
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,752
Hey, how about this?

154
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,454
W, wha, what!?

155
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,690
Did you get scared?

156
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,261
What are you doing!

157
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,099
Where did she go?

158
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,036
Was she looking at this?

159
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,112
Got funny taste.

160
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,746
What do you want?

161
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:05,720
Well... err... nothing.

162
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,355
If you come close to me, you will die.

163
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,896
Uhh... See you.

164
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:16,859
I will die? What am I?

165
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,508
What the?

166
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,215
That's strange...

167
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,347
Where did she go?

168
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,097
Shit, did she go home angry?

169
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,469
She is such a pest when she's angry.

170
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,077
Oh, hey. Is Yua home?

171
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,978
Brother, where did you go!?

172
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,581
I thought the rapist got you!

173
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,011
Yua, so you're home. That's great.

174
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:13,824
What do you mean great!? Where did you go, leaving me
alone!?

175
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:18,990
If you don't come home now, I am going to eat your
dinner!

176
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,758
OK! OK! I will go home now!

177
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,101
Shit, she's pissed!

178
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,267
Crap, crap!

179
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,022
I can save 3 minutes through here.

180
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,068
At this place?

181
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,472
Is there a couple here?

182
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:08,139
I must look at this as a healthy boy, not a pervert.

183
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:22,216
I can't see because things are in the way.

184
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,646
S and... M?

185
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,655
It's a girl...
Please some... give it to me.

186
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,920
It will be me.
No, me.

187
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,625
I will do it.

188
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,759
Please... it's wet. Touch it...

189
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,707
I can't hold out any longer.

190
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,604
Right there. More... more!

191
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,149
What is... that!?

192
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:27,558
Her nipples are hard.
Her juice is overflowing.

193
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,723
It feels good. Wonderful.

194
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,531
Deep inside me... right there, more!

195
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,632
It's coming in! Great! More, more!

196
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,573
Stir me more!!

197
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,450
Mikage...?

198
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:03,927
More... that's it... anything... give me more!

199
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:10,226
Give me more... my tits... my butt... all of it

200
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,600
Mikage!?

201
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,605
She's so loose, I can almost stick a fist inside.

202
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,344
Give it to my mouth. My mouth is lonely!

203
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,086
Let me have some.

204
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:34,258
Fine, I'll stick mine in.
Me too.

205
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,655
Give me a lot, ok?

206
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:42,097
Spray me with the white thing... spray me...

207
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,629
We sure will...

208
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,037
I'm so happy... but let me drink it

209
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,599
Yeah. We definitely will.

210
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:58,549
Really? You better. That white liquid... I want it now!

211
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:02,278
Here, here's the thing you wanted.

212
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:25,667
A lot... a lot... Yes!! Yes!!!!!

213
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,497
Akitoshi... lets go home together.

214
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,472
You're done cleaning, right?

215
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,075
W, what's going on!?

216
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,711
I found you, Akitoshi.

217
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:22,322
Why are you running away? Are you not going home with
me?

218
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,063
Are you really Mikage?

219
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,302
Of course it's me.

220
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,375
Who is it?

221
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,916
The lights still up... you guys are bold.

222
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,424
Makes it easier for me to kill.

223
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,913
A... Ai...?

224
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,395
We got you now.
Don't look down on us.

225
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,797
You think you got me?

226
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,507
Power of Thunder!

227
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,125
Too slow!

228
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:03,728
Shit!

229
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:11,934
This isn't getting anywhere.

230
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,771
I... it's her.

231
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,447
The girl in my dreams.

232
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,014
It's her!

233
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,946
This is the end.

234
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:17,871
During one person's life, it is said that there are many who
can change your destiny. I did not believe that.

235
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,501
Until now...
