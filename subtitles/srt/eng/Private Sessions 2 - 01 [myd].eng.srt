1
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,340
Master...

2
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,615
Coincidences really do happen!

3
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,852
You have the same face as me, and
we both have the same last name.

4
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,856
On top of that, we've
both majored in the arts!

5
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,422
It really is a miracle that
I was able to meet you!

6
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,060
Yes... Master...

7
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,672
I never would have guessed that
you used to be a teacher, Tomoya.

8
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,471
You look young. I thought you
were the same age as me.

9
00:00:55,155 --> 00:01:03,927
M... Master. Please make me go
crazy with your big hard cock.

10
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:09,497
No! Master! I want it... Give it to me.

11
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:15,908
I want your cock so much,
I can't stop thrusting.

12
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,004
I'm going to the College
of Sacred Maidens...

13
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,013
...to do my student teaching
internship, starting tomorrow.

14
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,076
I'm sure you know about it. It's
the famous rich girl college.

15
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:32,287
It's filled with hot women. It's
paradise. I can't wait until tomorrow.

16
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,063
Hurry, Master...

17
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:49,174
I want your cock... Please... I
want you to stick it in my pussy.

18
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,577
No fair... I want it. Give it to me...

19
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:06,623
Yes! Master! I... I... I'm going to...

20
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:14,029
Your fingers... They're touching
me where it makes me feel good...

21
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,004
Professor... Professor... Professor Ishiguro.

22
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,810
Professor Ishiguro.

23
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,320
Ow!

24
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,488
Are you okay, Professor?

25
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,093
Yeah... The class ran late last
night, so I didn't get much sleep.

26
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:46,831
Asuka Minamoto.

27
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,163
You know my name?

28
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,037
Of course I do. You're going to be the
lead actress in the theater club show...

29
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,839
...even though you're actually
a track club member.

30
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,101
Plus, you're cute, so it didn't take
much for me to learn your name.

31
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,710
Um... Professor Ishiguro...

32
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:03,912
What is it?

33
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,118
Professor Kirishima was calling
for you in the faculty office.

34
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:09,682
Kirishima...

35
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,547
Oh shit!

36
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:17,994
Captain Seira. Have you been using it
lately? Your time isn't getting any better.

37
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:25,035
Yoko... But that... It smells
weird and it makes me feel ill...

38
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,237
You have to!

39
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,574
You were able to do so well at the last
tournament because of those herbs.

40
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:36,981
Anyway, the herbs are safe.
They're sold on the internet.

41
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,583
You have to keep taking them.

42
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:46,355
Seira Himeno, the captain of the
swim team, and Yoko Yuuki...

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,762
Professor Ishiguro! Didn't I ask you to
submit that report during lunch break?

44
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:59,599
Now, now, Professor Kirishima. I think
that's enough. He's still a student.

45
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,305
He's hasn't learned what it's
like to have responsibilities.

46
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,302
He doesn't know exactly what
it means to be a teacher.

47
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:11,682
<i>Who the hell does he think he is? What</i>
<i>an idiot. I used to be a real teacher.</i>

48
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,282
<i>This phys-ed professor is dating Kirishima...</i>

49
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,890
<i> </i>
...<i>but he's trying to fuck</i>
<i>her sister Yumi. Sick fuck.</i>

50
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,758
Let's go Seishun. Go! Go! Seishun!
...<i>but he's trying to fuck</i>
<i>her sister Yumi. Sick fuck.</i>

51
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:23,354
Let's go Seishun. Go! Go! Seishun!
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

52
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:28,957
Let's go Seishun. Go! Go! Seishun!
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

53
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,203
They'll be my next pets.

54
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,936
Asuka Minamoto is helping out the
theater club because she accidentally...

55
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:43,080
...injured Miki Tachibana, but there's
something dirty going on there.

56
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,880
Seira Himeno, the captain
of the swim team...

57
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,345
...has an amazing swim time
record, but she's doping up.

58
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:52,256
They were saying "herbs," but I
guess these girls don't know...

59
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:57,929
...that there are drug-laced herbs being
sold on the internet. If the cops found out...

60
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:02,661
...it wouldn't end with them not being
able to participate in swim tournaments.

61
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:09,075
Master. I've done my best and collected
as much information as I could. Please...

62
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,642
I want my reward...

63
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:19,279
Shut up, you female pig. I'm
thinking. Go fuck yourself.

64
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,319
The third one... Yumi Kirishima...

65
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,653
Yumi is getting sexually harassed by
her phys-ed professor, Samejima...

66
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:40,197
...but she can't tell anyone. Can't
blame her... He's dating her sister.

67
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,840
That stupid idiot. Of course Yumi's
going to run from you if you do that...

68
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,673
Professor Kirishima, look!

69
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:57,587
It's my costume, but Miki lent it to me.
Now we'll make it in time for the show.

70
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,227
That's wonderful. I'm glad
Miki let you borrow it.

71
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,257
Yes! I've caused Miki so much trouble,
but when I explained the situation...

72
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,991
...she lent it to me.

73
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,730
I see. I'm glad you two
were able to make up...

74
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,900
...after what happened between you two.

75
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:21,075
Yes, Miki was supposed to wear
this costume, but because of me...

76
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:28,183
Asuka, what's happened has happened.
Good luck as the lead actress...

77
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,057
Make sure you lock up, because
things have been getting stolen...

78
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,022
...from the theater clubroom lately.

79
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,863
Professor Ishiguro, what are you staring at?

80
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,992
Oh, sorry!

81
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,832
I know Asuka is beautiful so you want to
stare at her, but you're interfering here.

82
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,269
Please understand, you're an educator here.

83
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:49,732
I see...

84
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:56,705
Yumi, could you help me clean up the gym
storage room after the club activities?

85
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,244
Um... Okay...

86
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:03,751
I knew I could count on Satsuki's
sister. Everyone else is lazy.

87
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:08,123
You're a cheerleader, so
you should tie your hair up.

88
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:12,960
Yumi! Can you show me where the gym is?

89
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,398
S... sure!

90
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,897
Thanks. This place is so
big, I can't seem to find it.

91
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:26,878
Professor Kirishima, I'm borrowing
your sister. Please excuse us.

92
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:35,683
Are you all right?

93
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:43,385
Um, Professor Ishiguro...
I... Thank you very much.

94
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,357
Do you not get along
with Professor Samejima?

95
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,695
Um... That's...

96
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,631
It's okay. He's not my favorite person either.

97
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,941
You too?

98
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:04,139
Professor Samejima touches me
and brings his face close to mine...

99
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,818
I really don't like it.

100
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,181
So you don't like people touching you?

101
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:16,393
No, that's not what I meant. I don't like
it when it's Professor Samejima, but...

102
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,754
I wouldn't mind you...

103
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,960
You wouldn't mind me what?

104
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,431
Nothing! Goodbye!

105
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,033
Well, well...

106
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,014
Who's he?

107
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,352
He's the student professor that
came here three days ago, Captain.

108
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,189
Why is he here?

109
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,294
I don't know.

110
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,694
I don't like it.

111
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,758
Captain!

112
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,000
Who gave you permission to be here?

113
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,977
You need permission to
come look at the pool?

114
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:10,639
Of course. It's distracting to the members
when outsiders are coming in and out.

115
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,920
Plus, it's absurd to have a man
come look at a women-only pool.

116
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,856
I wanted to know everything
about the school.

117
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,349
Who do I need to get permission from?

118
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,385
You get it from me, the Captain.

119
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,162
Then can I get permission?

120
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,795
Absolutely not.

121
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:34,133
Professor Ishiguro... Why does an art
professor need to check out the pool?

122
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:39,802
I bet you're only here to see women
in bathing suits, not the pool.

123
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:45,007
That's just like a pervert. Please
leave, Professor Ishiguro.

124
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,316
Now! Or else I'll call the other professors!

125
00:09:53,125 --> 00:10:00,861
Damn it! What a bitch. Who does she think
she is? I'll have to give her strict training.

126
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,203
No, stop professor!
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

127
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:04,303
What are you saying? You came
here because you love me, right?
No, stop professor!

128
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:09,075
What are you saying? You came
here because you love me, right?
<i>

129
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:09,175
What are you saying? You came
here because you love me, right?
You're wrong. I'll tell sis!

130
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,440
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
You're wrong. I'll tell sis!

131
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,839
Go ahead. I wonder how hurt she'll be?

132
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,449
Her lover taken from her by her
younger sister... She'll be so shocked.

133
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,719
We'll keep it our secret. That should be fine.

134
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:32,261
No, someone help me! Professor Ishiguro!

135
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,922
What? Why are you calling his name?

136
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:40,002
Professor Ishiguro! Help!
Professor Ishiguro...

137
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:45,172
It's useless. No one's coming
to help you, so do as I say!

138
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,136
This way!

139
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,121
That was a close one.
Are you all right, Yumi?

140
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,093
Not even a "thanks" when I saved her...

141
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,016
Miki Tachibana
Asuka Minamoto

<i> </i>
I'll never forgive you... Asuka Minamoto...

Miki Tachibana

Asuka Minamoto

I was injured because of
her and she took my role...

Miki Tachibana
Asuka Minamoto

Do you have any idea how hard I worked?
<i> </i>

148
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:40,465
If the stolen tickets are found
in Asuka's costume, it's over.

149
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,259
Everyone will have no choice
but to select me as the lead.

150
00:11:55,014 --> 00:12:00,418
<i>Amateur. Stolen tickets aren't going to do it!</i>

151
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,680
<i>Let's see ... The preparations for</i>
<i>the hunt are pretty much done...</i>

152
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,916
<i>It's going to get fun, starting tomorrow.</i>

153
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,772
Here it is, Master.

154
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,665
This must be the site the swimming
team has been ordering the herbs from.

155
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:31,072
I knew it. It's not herbs, it's drugs. Now
we know exactly what she's taking.

156
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:36,247
Wow! Master, how do you know?

157
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:40,656
Because I've used this site before.

158
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,026
Now I know that little bitch
Seira Himeno's weakness.

159
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,825
I'll chase her down until
she becomes my slave.

160
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:55,302
I can also use the story about
the stolen items Asuka has...

161
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,039
Let's see, which should come first...

162
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:03,972
Master. Yumi Kirishima just
gave me a letter to give to you.

163
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:04,780
Let's see...

164
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,448
"I want to thank you for the other day."

165
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:12,384
"I'll be waiting for you at the gym
storage room after club activities."

166
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,089
How interesting... It's decided.
Yumi, you'll be my first prey!

167
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,461
Mira. Madoka. Have the cameras ready.

168
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:22,098
Right.

169
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:33,435
Yumi?

170
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,173
Professor Ishiguro?

171
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,943
I'm sorry I'm late.

172
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,047
Huh?

173
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,510
What's wrong, Yumi?

174
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:47,985
Well it's... It's... I thought
you wouldn't come.

175
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:56,424
I was assaulted by Professor
Samejima, then you saw it...

176
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:05,174
I thought you would hate me... I was
so worried while I was waiting for you.

177
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:06,871
Yumi...

178
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:16,779
Everyone said "let's go home", but I stayed
here by myself waiting for you... I...

179
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:24,518
I love you, Professor Ishiguro.
Professor, please don't hate me.

180
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,661
You love me?

181
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,832
Yes, if it's you... I'd be
able to give myself...

182
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,704
Professor?

183
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:45,984
You love me? How funny!
I love you too, Yumi!

184
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,278
I love you so much that I
want to make you my pet.

185
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,686
Pet?

186
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,226
Professor Ishiguro... Stop...!

187
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:02,533
What? I thought you said you'd be
able give yourself if it was me.

188
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,035
Was that a lie?

189
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:10,942
It's not a lie... But we haven't even kissed.

190
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,243
There you go.

191
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,947
No... I'm scared Professor!

192
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,488
No!

193
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,061
Professor... I'm not ready for this...

194
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,034
No!

195
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,739
No! It hurts! It hurts!

196
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,804
What? Only the head is in.

197
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:50,647
Stop! Please! No! It hurts! It hurts!

198
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:58,154
I'm going to break!
Professor, please pull out!

199
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:04,459
Do you get it? I'm your first man.

200
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:12,134
A woman's pussy is made so it can take
a man's cock. It's not going to break.

201
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:18,706
But... But... It hurts... Please stop,
because it hurts... No more...

202
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:26,212
If you hate it this much, I guess you
can't be with me, even if I love you.

203
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,781
Professor?

204
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,946
If you love me, prove it to the end.

205
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:55,308
That's right, Yumi... That's
good. I'm going to let it all out.

206
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,215
Let what out?

207
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,147
I'm going to cum!

208
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:16,998
Good job, Yumi. If you listen to
what I say, I'll treat you the best.

209
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,537
It hurts! It hurts!

210
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,706
Don't move!

211
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,945
Good footage.

212
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:38,582
Come in.

213
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,989
Why did you call for me? What
do you want, Professor Ishiguro?

214
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:49,230
It better not be to ask for
permission to visit the pool.

215
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:54,531
This is the one and only reason
why I wanted to speak to you.

216
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,333
That's...

217
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,137
Where did you get it?

218
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,940
Did you get it from my locker? You criminal!

219
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,413
Oh! Who are you calling a criminal?

220
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,714
You! You snuck into the women's locker
room and stole a student's belongings.

221
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,188
That's terrible! This is the
end of the line for you.

222
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,925
I'm going to tell Professor
Kirishima and get you kicked out!

223
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:21,827
Are you saying all this,
knowing what's in this bag?

224
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:28,029
What's inside? They're just
herbs that make you feel good.

225
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:33,934
Do you honestly believe that? You're
starting to figure out what they are.

226
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:39,915
They're illegal drugs that make you high!

227
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,119
I guess you didn't figure it out all the way.

228
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,919
You know what's going to
happen if everyone finds out?

229
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:52,428
You and the entire swim
team will be suspended.

230
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,430
So what are you going to do, Captain?

231
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,196
Tell 'em.

232
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,101
What?

233
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:04,099
Tell the police, or whoever. I'm not gonna
be blackmailed by a lowlife like you.

234
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,371
Excuse me.

235
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,978
What are you doing?

236
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,542
You're such a bitch!

237
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,219
Ow! You're hurting me, you bastard!

238
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,950
You have nowhere to run. You
have no choice but to be my pet!

239
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:28,189
What are you talking about? A
pet? What are you, an idiot? No!

240
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,467
What a beautiful body. You don't
even have any beauty marks.

241
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:41,743
No! You pervert! Let go! Let
go of me! Someone! Anyone!

242
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:46,011
Give it up. There's no use struggling.

243
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,015
You scum!

244
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,453
No! Stop! You pervert!

245
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,787
What? Is this your first time?
You don't strike me as a virgin.

246
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,553
No! Stop!

247
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,634
No... I'm sorry. Please stop.

248
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:06,871
Make sure you watch this moment,
as you become a real woman!

249
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,566
No!

250
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,869
You're fit, so your pussy's really tight.

251
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,270
Can you see? It's proof that
you've become a woman.

252
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:22,843
No... No more... Stop... Please...

253
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:28,782
You still don't understand your position,
do you? We've only just begun.

254
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,619
Let me take my time to teach
you what it's like to be my pet!

255
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:33,296
But...

256
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,263
Let me baptize you as my pet! Take it!

257
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,363
No!

258
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:47,400
Seira Himeno is mine. The last one...

259
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,077
One more to go...

260
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,651
Professor Ishiguro.

261
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,453
I'm sorry to bother you during
rehearsal. Is Asuka here?

262
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:08,789
Did you come for Asuka? She's in the back.

263
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:09,924
Thanks.

264
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,771
Miki, thank you so much for the dress.

265
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,936
It's going to be a great show, thanks to you.

266
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:23,806
Sure... I hand-made it, so you
better take good care of it.

267
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:30,489
I will. Um... Miki, in the chest pocket...

268
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:30,822
Asuka.

269
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:31,186
Asuka.

270
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:39,958
You're almost on, right? I'll be
watching from the curtain. Good luck.

271
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,963
O-okay...

272
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,233
Excuse me.

273
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,808
I'm sorry to call you. I know
you're tired from practice.

274
00:21:56,281 --> 00:22:00,274
Not at all. Why did you want
me to come in costume?

275
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,518
There's something I wanted to check.

276
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,523
You know that things have been
getting stolen in the theater club, right?

277
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,589
Yes, but so what?

278
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:16,297
Your costume's strange chest
bulge caught my attention, so...

279
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:21,096
It's nothing. I have to leave.

280
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,203
Are you trying to hide something?

281
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,305
Of course not!

282
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:29,907
Then there's no need to
run. Here, let me see.

283
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:38,512
I knew the stolen items would be
there. Did you steal this, Asuka?

284
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,718
No! It wasn't me.

285
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:47,591
Then was it the owner of the
costume? That would be Miki...

286
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,166
Please wait, Professor...

287
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,132
It was me. I did it.

288
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,933
Then you lied?

289
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:07,249
Y... yes... I was scared... But... I stole it.

290
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:12,653
Wow! You're bolder than I thought. Your
parents are going to be disappointed.

291
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,891
You stole tickets, and this?

292
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,361
That's...

293
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:22,866
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...

294
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:23,932
...one hundred thousand yen.

295
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,636
That's a lot of money. On top of that...

296
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,830
...there are several thousand
dollars in the bank.

297
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,840
What are you going to do
about this? You'll get expelled.

298
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,211
You know what's going to happen if
you get arrested by the cops, right?

299
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:41,486
B-but...! No! It wasn't me! I really didn't do it!

300
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:47,648
What? But this is the
proof. You can't get away.

301
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,224
Or are you covering for someone?

302
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:51,724
That's...

303
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,221
Miki Tachibana?

304
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:59,166
I knew it... I won't say a word...

305
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:00,602
R... really?

306
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,567
Yes, really. But but only if
you listen to what I say.

307
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:14,450
Thank you so much. I'll do anything,
so please don't tell anyone about this.

308
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,781
Okay.

309
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,289
No!

310
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,091
Stop! Please stop! Why are you doing this?

311
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:29,296
I have to lie to the professor in charge.
So I should get something in return.

312
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,568
But...

313
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,230
You'd better work hard
for your friend, Asuka.

314
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,437
No... Stop...

315
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,549
Please stop...

316
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,753
You really think we can stop now?

317
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,885
You're squeezing me. Great pussy.

318
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,263
Stop... No...

319
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,128
What are you saying? The fun starts here.

320
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,834
See? It went in all the way.

321
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:15,176
It's your first time. No wonder it's so tight.

322
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,108
Miki... Miki... Help...

323
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,074
Please... No...

324
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:26,680
Do you honestly think the friend who
framed you will come to save you?

325
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,823
You have a lot to learn.

326
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,828
Who's fault is it that you're getting raped?

327
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:41,302
Miki was injured because of me... So...

328
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,669
A beautiful friendship... but look
at what's happening to you!

329
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:09,794
No... Someone help me...
This is... This is... No...

330
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,497
No... Stop...

331
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,134
No more... I can't anymore...

332
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:18,032
Please let me go.

333
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:23,778
I'm going to break. Please
pull out, Professor.

334
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:30,880
No... No... No more... Please...
Please stop... Please...

335
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,525
The curtains have just opened.

336
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,858
Now I'm going to move on to training them.

337
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,793
It'll be interesting to see how they turn out.
