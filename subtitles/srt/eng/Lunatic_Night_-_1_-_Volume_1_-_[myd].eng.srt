1
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:34,159
Full moon tonight.

2
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,858
Hey, Kanzaki. Long time.

3
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,525
Mutsuki?

4
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:44,535
I've wanted to see you!

5
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:46,435
Okay, I get the picture!

6
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:55,078
A trip? Where did you go?

7
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:57,674
Lots of places.

8
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,741
I've brought you a souvenir.

9
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:01,413
A souvenir?

10
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:05,947
She loves people, she's cute.
She'll make a great pet.

11
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:10,428
But this is an apartment.
I can't have pets here.

12
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:12,623
My landlady wouldn't hear of it.

13
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:13,961
No problem.

14
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:17,628
She won't be any trouble at all.
She's very well trained.

15
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:19,501
Hey, come on in!

16
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:21,504
Wait a minute!

17
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,379
She's human!

18
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:33,712
Think so? She's got long ears.

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,987
She's got a tail.

20
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,545
And sharp teeth.

21
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,581
A magnificent animal.

22
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,217
Pleased to meet you!

23
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:44,054
She, she can speak!

24
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,824
You ain't seen nothing yet.

25
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,229
You've got to be kidding!

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,792
And she loves to you-know-what.

27
00:01:52,372 --> 00:01:56,138
I'm out of here. Have a good time.

28
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:59,073
Take care of your Master, here.

29
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:00,134
I will.

30
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:03,278
Hey!

31
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:05,077
Wait!

32
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,186
Do you have a name?

33
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:16,692
I was told that my Master
would name me.

34
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:19,163
So you think I'm your Master, huh?

35
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:22,095
What exactly are you, anyway?

36
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:24,694
I don't know.

37
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:27,535
Well, where are you from?

38
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:29,939
I don't know. Only...

39
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:36,971
I was told to tend
to your needs, Master.

40
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,486
To fulfill your physical desires,
and release your spirit.

41
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:44,079
It's necessary,
in order to help you reawaken.

42
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:46,020
Reawaken?

43
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:01,937
This tail of yours is actually real.

44
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,946
Wonder what it's like in there?

45
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,833
Move your hand. Let me taste you.

46
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,797
Yes!

47
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:37,865
It's so good!

48
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:40,009
Here I come.

49
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:19,344
Oh my God! I'm going to come!

50
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:29,187
What the hell?! What's this?

51
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,332
I've decided on your name.

52
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:48,609
Kuaru. That'll be your name
from now on.

53
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:49,978
Ruff!

54
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:06,862
Well, how was Kanzaki?

55
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:10,700
It seems like his memory
is starting to come back.

56
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,941
What's this tower?!

57
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:28,448
What the hell?!

58
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:31,918
What's that thing?!

59
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:36,891
The other night he dreamt of a tower,
and a giant bird.

60
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:42,298
He also dreamt of a giant robot hand.

61
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,232
Just as planned.

62
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:47,395
I see.

63
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,907
I'll be going back now.

64
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:52,137
Wait just a minute.

65
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,274
Strip, Kuaru.

66
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:56,474
Huh?

67
00:05:56,882 --> 00:06:00,318
But I'm Kanzaki's servant.

68
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,754
Strip, Kuaru.

69
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:13,429
Hands on the desk.

70
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:50,292
Kuaru? I'm back.

71
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:52,202
You here?

72
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,029
Maybe it was all an illusion.

73
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:58,342
A weird dream about
Mutsuki and Kuaru...

74
00:06:58,411 --> 00:07:00,538
...because of the full moon.

75
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,238
I know!

76
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:04,510
I remember the name of that bird.

77
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:06,979
It's Karura!

78
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:23,996
Master!

79
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:28,769
It's been a long time.
I'm so happy to see you.

80
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:30,934
Huh? Um...

81
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,709
You finally decided to come back
to the tower, Master.

82
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:37,009
I'm so glad.

83
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,949
You know about the tower?

84
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:43,747
Who are you?! Tell me everything!

85
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:48,021
Master. So you haven't
fully recovered your memory?

86
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:52,863
I'm one of 3 gods that guard
the Tower of Babel with you.

87
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,524
I am Karura, bird woman.

88
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,158
Tower of Babel?

89
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:57,497
Yes.

90
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,530
You built it to restore
the lost world of Atlantis.

91
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:04,073
I did?

92
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,839
Let's return to the
Tower of Babel, Master.

93
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:10,177
We'll see everyone,
just like old times.

94
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:11,238
Yeah, sure.

95
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:23,327
This is the bedroom, Master.

96
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:27,196
Not exactly the first place
to be showing people.

97
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:29,359
But it's the bedroom.

98
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:30,760
Huh?

99
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:34,698
Welcome back, Master!
I've awaited you.

100
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,271
Who are you?

101
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:37,366
Neptune!

102
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:44,546
Let's celebrate!

103
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:52,319
I can tell you're glad to see me.

104
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:57,262
You must think
I'm some kind of pervert.

105
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,655
Here I come.

106
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:13,405
I think I'll join them!

107
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:22,145
Me too, Master!

108
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,051
Oh, it's so good!

109
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,997
That's not fair! Me too!

110
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,430
No! Come to me!

111
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:43,334
No, me!

112
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:44,808
Me, I said!

113
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,271
I'm coming!

114
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,543
My three servants?

115
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,084
Yes.

116
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:58,248
Neptune, of the sea.
And me, Karura, of the air.

117
00:09:58,824 --> 00:10:02,783
And Kuaru,
who was found abandoned.

118
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:05,160
She can transform into
a furry beast and...

119
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:06,163
What?

120
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,166
So she's in on this too?

121
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:09,531
You know her?

122
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:12,230
Mutsuki brought her to me.

123
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:15,367
That means she's with Mutsuki!

124
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:20,612
I knew someone was nosing
around the Tower secrets.

125
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,579
It must be Mutsuki.

126
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,212
Must be.

127
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:28,276
He's trying to use you Master,
to manipulate the Tower's powers.

128
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,718
Kuaru could be in trouble!

129
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:35,351
Don't worry about her.
Even though she's been brainwashed...

130
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,624
...as long as she's useful,
she'll be safe.

131
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:40,321
I guess so...

132
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,764
Master!

133
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:47,466
How about it? We've been apart
for so long!

134
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,435
Hey! Count me in!

135
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,376
Hope I can keep this up.

136
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:05,313
Finished, at last.
My very own servant!

137
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:17,998
M, Master?

138
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,506
That's right. I'm your Master.

139
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,402
You... you...

140
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:27,341
You can call me Your Majesty!

141
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:32,506
Your personality isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

142
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:38,352
Lick my heels!

143
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,693
I'm exhausted!
How many times today?

144
00:11:59,144 --> 00:12:03,808
I destroyed Atlantis,
and will annihilate the world too?

145
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:05,008
Correct.

146
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:08,713
An error in your experiment...

147
00:12:08,787 --> 00:12:11,347
...sunk the continent of Atlantis.

148
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:16,157
You must obtain the energy
to resurrect Atlantis...

149
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:19,026
...from the world's pyramids...

150
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,897
...and store the energy.

151
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:25,870
Isn't all that power dangerous?

152
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:28,799
Sudden environmental changes...

153
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:32,867
...have caused 98% of human death
throughout history.

154
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:36,707
But the Atlantean civilization
can be rebuilt.

155
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:40,246
The Atlantis Program can commence...

156
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,843
...on your command.
- Wait!

157
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,252
I will not destroy civilization.

158
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:49,025
If you neglect the Pyramid Power,
it will run rampant.

159
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:52,461
Either way, the world
will be destroyed.

160
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:59,604
I know! We'll destroy the Pyramids!

161
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:01,799
My servants will help.

162
00:13:01,974 --> 00:13:03,942
We'll save the world!

163
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:12,272
Terrible fog.
Visibility of only 10 meters.

164
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,412
What the hell?!

165
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,089
What is it?!

166
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:34,065
A monster!

167
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:42,905
First target,
Egypt's Pyramids of Giza.

168
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:50,378
Weapons door open.

169
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:52,447
Energy level 120%.

170
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:59,890
Anti-shock and firing
preparations... ready!

171
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:02,795
Your orders, Master!

172
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,762
Commence fire!

173
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:05,861
Roger!

174
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:07,294
Fire!

175
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:25,881
New York is hit.

176
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,224
An area 150 km. Around the city
has been destroyed.

177
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:36,363
That's strange.
Let's try that again.

178
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:41,065
Launch of second attack.

179
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,438
Russia's Lake Baikal has evaporated.

180
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,033
Fool! Stop this!

181
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,207
All right! Proceeding to third attack!

182
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:52,073
The Arabian Peninsula
has been destroyed.

183
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:55,849
Stop, Neptune! Return at once!

184
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:04,251
Howdy.

185
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:08,664
At last we meet again, Kanzaki.

186
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:11,965
Mutsuki! Where the hell
did you come from?

187
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,005
A crack in that stone.

188
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:15,635
You monster.

189
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,799
You got it.

190
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:22,211
I sold my soul to the Devil,
to work with you.

191
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,945
How about it?
Will you join forces with me?

192
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:30,182
Will you use this Tower
to try to destroy the world?

193
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:35,124
As long as the Tower exists,
people can become gods.

194
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:37,321
There lies my purpose.

195
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,057
Is Kuaru okay?

196
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:42,458
Master, it's good to see you.

197
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:45,133
Kuaru!

198
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:48,799
I've looked forward to seeing you!

199
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,739
You haven't been mistreated?

200
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:52,902
Yes, the entire time.

201
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:56,374
Well?

202
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:59,940
How about you both
cooperate with me?

203
00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:01,110
Master!

204
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,813
Neptune has hit the Middle East!

205
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:09,957
What is that?!
What's he doing here?!

206
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:10,824
Hi!

207
00:16:10,896 --> 00:16:11,794
It's Mutsuki.

208
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:13,331
Enemy of my Master!

209
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:15,223
Stop, Karura!

210
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:31,240
At least I look somewhat human
on the outside.

211
00:16:31,316 --> 00:16:34,149
Inside is what's important.

212
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:46,962
Oh, yes.

213
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:54,899
I'm going crazy.

214
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:06,741
It's no time for this kind of thing.

215
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,810
The future of humanity lies
in the balance.

216
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:13,922
What do we have to do... aah...
to save the world?

217
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,649
Well.

218
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:16,716
Alert!

219
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:21,926
An international commission
has been formed to investigate.

220
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:23,301
What?!

221
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,439
How can you run off
at a time like this?!

222
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,614
How do we stop him, CPU?

223
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,678
Ending his life is the only way.

224
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:44,586
That can be accomplished
with the Tower defense system.

225
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:48,422
What if something happens
to the Tower?

226
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,324
Surprised?

227
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:56,026
Well, Unit V?

228
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:57,533
What's wrong?

229
00:17:57,836 --> 00:18:00,066
The batteries ran out.

230
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:03,699
Just had the positive
and negative in backwards.

231
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:06,266
No wonder her personality
was all wrong.

232
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:09,746
This time I'll get the positive
and negative lined up right.

233
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:21,492
Master!

234
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,291
Hard to believe...

235
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:29,391
...she's the same gal
that made me lick her heels.

236
00:18:29,468 --> 00:18:32,528
What? Did I do such an awful thing?

237
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:33,905
Yeah.

238
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:36,133
Use your mouth to make it up.

239
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,505
Here.

240
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:38,565
No!

241
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:42,811
That's right. Now struggle even harder.

242
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:57,155
No!

243
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,325
Be gentle with me.

244
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:05,427
Spread yourself for me. I'll watch.

245
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,208
Don't make me do anything strange.

246
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:23,117
Please forgive me.
I'm so ashamed.

247
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,090
You're sure wet...

248
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,789
Now show me what you like to do.

249
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,959
Do you want me?

250
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:40,663
Stop.

251
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:43,734
Look how wet you are.

252
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:46,076
I'm going mad.

253
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:48,335
I'll drive you mad.

254
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:51,976
It hurts!

255
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:55,952
Please... don't thrust so hard!

256
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,880
It's so good.

257
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,218
Nice fuck!

258
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,664
Hey, Kanzaki!

259
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:14,833
They're trying to stop me. Let's talk.

260
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:21,211
Talk about what?

261
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,270
I'll be straight with you.

262
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,283
You don't deserve to rule the Tower.

263
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:28,184
Why not?!

264
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:32,188
Kanzaki, how many deaths
do you think you've caused?

265
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:38,125
All because you couldn't
handle the Tower's power.

266
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:41,789
But I know the correct way
to use that power.

267
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:46,703
If you truly wanted to save humanity,
you'd join me.

268
00:20:49,941 --> 00:20:52,432
He could be right.

269
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:55,939
Can I risk putting people's lives
on the line again?

270
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,541
Shall we wash your back for you?

271
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:05,354
What should I do?

272
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:07,391
As you please, Master.

273
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,093
With that Neptune
robot running amuck...

274
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:14,528
...the disintegration of
the Pyramids have sped up.

275
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,396
At this rate, there are
just three days left.

276
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,396
Deeper!

277
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:35,244
What's your answer, Kanzaki?

278
00:21:38,356 --> 00:21:39,948
Mutsuki! Your face...!

279
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:41,014
Boo!

280
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:45,257
What the hell are you, anyway?

281
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,060
Just a nice guy, passing through.

282
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:51,058
What the hell is that!

283
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:55,870
Well, if that's your answer,
then I have an idea.

284
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,033
Kuaru!

285
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,706
Wait!

286
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,148
I won't let you pass!

287
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:08,652
You opposing me?

288
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,278
What a joke.

289
00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:15,458
I'll be back after Kanzaki's been brainwashed.

290
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:25,293
We've been warned if that
gets in the wrong hands...!

291
00:22:26,104 --> 00:22:27,935
We have no choice.

292
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,976
She's become like me!

293
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,483
She can repair herself!

294
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:10,676
Well Kanzaki? Last chance.

295
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,984
Will you become my partner,
or be brainwashed like Kuaru?

296
00:23:16,288 --> 00:23:17,721
I'll be your partner.

297
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,517
Master, no!

298
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,687
Are you sure, Kanzaki?

299
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,353
Yeah, I don't care anymore.

300
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:27,354
After all, the world will be destroyed.

301
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:31,595
Master!
I haven't been brainwashed!

302
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,830
What?

303
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:35,270
I was just faking it.

304
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,672
I didn't feel like I belonged!

305
00:23:38,243 --> 00:23:42,077
I'm useless among the servants.

306
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:44,409
I felt so alone.

307
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:45,676
I just wanted to belong!

308
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,184
Make her stop with this nonsense, Mutsuki!

309
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:49,686
There's trouble!

310
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:52,688
A strategic missile is locked
on the Tower!

311
00:23:52,957 --> 00:23:56,154
No! What about the Tower defense system?

312
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,626
No good.

313
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,685
Damn.

314
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:04,030
If only Master would ask me,
I would help him.

315
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:08,900
Karura!

316
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:11,841
You're safe!

317
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,502
Yes, I'm fine.

318
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,569
But we're out of time.

319
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:18,013
No, we still have a chance.

320
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,415
You go rescue Master.

321
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,123
Thank goodness.

322
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:29,922
The underground backup computer
wasn't damaged.

323
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,932
Kanzaki... the Tower!
The Tower of Babel!

324
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,910
This is the end of everything.

325
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:54,541
Twenty seconds to self-destruct.

326
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,087
I'll kill Kanzaki, and die myself.

327
00:24:57,355 --> 00:24:59,482
What?! You going to kill yourself?!

328
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,959
Master!

329
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:23,870
Karura!

330
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,725
Yeah? Who is it?!

331
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,430
A hacker.

332
00:25:47,138 --> 00:25:48,230
What happened?

333
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:50,297
My computer!

334
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:55,212
Someone's tapped into the main
computer, with a phone line.

335
00:25:57,982 --> 00:26:01,679
I have accessed your missile system...

336
00:26:01,753 --> 00:26:05,086
...and will destroy
the world's Pyramids.

337
00:26:06,124 --> 00:26:10,925
No! She's inputting codes
to launch nuclear missiles!

338
00:26:10,995 --> 00:26:12,360
Oh, no!

339
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:16,426
Oh, yeah!
Everything will be annihilated.

340
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:19,627
This woman's insane!

341
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:21,767
That's not our concern.

342
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,007
We've got to contact the other
countries and warn them!

343
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:28,340
There's no time!

344
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:30,505
The missile is launching!

345
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,616
We did it!

346
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:45,554
Congratulations, Master!

347
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,966
The earth is saved, thanks to us!

348
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:00,805
Thank God!

349
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:10,179
Oh, no, it seems like many cities
were destroyed.

350
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,152
As a reward...

351
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:17,888
...I'll give you something big,
fat and hard.

352
00:27:20,465 --> 00:27:21,796
Wow!

353
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:31,839
Oh, yeah!

354
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,106
Come, Master. Hurry.

355
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:48,125
Maybe I'll wait a bit longer
before I tell him the bad news.

356
00:27:54,365 --> 00:27:56,663
You're wonderful, Master!

357
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:58,361
Do it to me, too!

358
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:01,764
Don't worry, I'll look after all of you!

359
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:29,694
I'm getting off too much.

360
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,995
Don't stop now!

361
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,270
Hey, stop! Stop it!

362
00:28:38,142 --> 00:28:42,476
Like fruit falling from a tree branch...

363
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:47,109
...it is both an end
and a new beginning.

364
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,013
My poor Master!

365
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:57,025
As the world continues
to repeat history.

366
00:28:57,495 --> 00:29:00,692
It is power and progress.

367
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:06,293
The present is both the beginning
and the end.

368
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:10,199
And this is where it starts.
