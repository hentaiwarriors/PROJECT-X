1
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:25,066
O arrogant humanity!

2
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:29,737
Not all that exists is
visible to your mortal eyes!

3
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:32,748
Our world consists
of the realm of humans...

4
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:35,979
...the realm of man-beasts,
and the realm of demons.

5
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:40,614
And many of the demons
live in the human world.

6
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:50,590
There is a legend
among the demons.

7
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:57,266
That once, every 3000 years,
the Overfiend revives.

8
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,276
And upon his revival,
the three realms are...

9
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,337
...united to form
an eternal kingdom.

10
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:12,983
O arrogant humanity!

11
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:17,618
Heed well the voices of those
of the demon realm.

12
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:21,027
Humans are not the
supreme rulers of all.

13
00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:26,029
You shall know the truth
when the Overfiend revives.

14
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:33,368
And the promised time
is close at hand!

15
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:15,410
300 years since Amano Jyaku
went into the human world.

16
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:20,086
And not one word
of him since.

17
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:28,364
But I smell it...
Yes, I can smell it!

18
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:34,768
It can only be the stench
of the Overfiend!

19
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,800
UROTSUKIDOJI
Legend of the Overfiend

20
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:47,840
Part One
"Birth of the Overfiend"

21
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:57,750
"Myojin University"

22
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:29,314
So he's the one...

23
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:35,889
He's got the moves, and that
smell that drives women wild.

24
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:50,406
Cut it out!
I've gotta change!

25
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,675
- I was only kidding.
- What are you doing?

26
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,350
Holy...

27
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:08,787
Hi!

28
00:05:08,932 --> 00:05:11,799
- How's it going?
- Not bad.

29
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:14,200
It's Akemi!

30
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:17,896
Better give
it me all today.

31
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:37,048
Akemi...

32
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,291
Who's there?

33
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,762
Oh shit!

34
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,061
"Boys keep out!"

35
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,235
Anyone in here?!

36
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:52,132
Anybody there?

37
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,835
I don't see anyone.

38
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,242
Weird...
I'll bet someone was.

39
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:20,933
Go, Myojin!

40
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:24,564
Definitely not him.

41
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:36,448
Oh, yes...

42
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:47,953
I'm coming again!

43
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:50,793
That was great,
Ozaki!

44
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:57,062
Forget it. But men, someone's
defiling our hallowed gym!

45
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:58,465
Him!

46
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:16,123
What an idiot!

47
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,389
Hey man,
sorry I lost control.

48
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:22,896
I'm okay, Ozaki.

49
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:26,834
What part of Akemi
were you looking at?

50
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,501
All swollen,
aren't you?

51
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:34,509
Well, I, uhh...

52
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:38,002
Not just swollen...

53
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:43,218
I'll use my magic
charm to heal you.

54
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:51,527
See you later, Boner!

55
00:07:53,563 --> 00:07:55,030
Thanks...

56
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,532
Oh god..."Boner!"

57
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:29,223
Goddam Ozaki!
How humiliating!

58
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:34,563
Miss Togami.
She doesn't look too happy.

59
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:38,897
Akemi!

60
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:47,210
Come in.

61
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:48,409
Yes, ma'am.

62
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:55,255
I wonder what she
wants Akemi for.

63
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,956
You wanted to
speak with me...?

64
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:08,095
It's very important.
I'm in a bit of a jam.

65
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:15,076
I'm looking for something,
and I need your strength...

66
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:17,612
No, your body.

67
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:19,578
What are you
looking for?

68
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:23,709
Well now...

69
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:29,725
It's the most wonderful
thing for us, as women.

70
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:30,781
Understand?

71
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,555
- No...
- You don't?

72
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:35,960
Then I'll show you.

73
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:46,931
Wha...
What are you doing?!

74
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:51,813
I haven't seen it yet,
but it's very near.

75
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:53,940
Don't you want
to see it, too?

76
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,493
Stop it!

77
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:18,502
Stop it, please...!

78
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:41,352
Akemi!

79
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,469
I think you'd better
watch a little longer.

80
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,534
You're that new transfer
student, Ama... Ama...

81
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:54,432
Amano.
It's a pleasure.

82
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:11,121
Look at 'em go!

83
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:13,719
You can see
behind the curtain?

84
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,393
I'll give you pleasures
beyond this realm!

85
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:04,880
What the...?

86
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,903
I can't take this!
I'm going in!

87
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:03,666
Don't!

88
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,441
Someone's watching?!

89
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:33,024
I wondered who...
Just some little shit!

90
00:13:33,703 --> 00:13:36,263
And you're a miserable
excuse for a monster!

91
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:39,467
Little shit
with a big mouth!

92
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:43,573
You came all the way
from the demon realm...

93
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:46,206
But you just couldn't resist
a little pussy, could you?

94
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:48,712
You're no human!

95
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:51,315
At least I'm not
a fuckin' monster.

96
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:53,879
You little...!

97
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,061
Who are you?

98
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,067
You don't know me?
You really ARE a loser!

99
00:14:18,414 --> 00:14:22,748
You're Amano Jyaku, the
half-breed of the beast realm!

100
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:28,423
You're after him too, right?
But you'll never get him!

101
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:48,433
Satisfied?
WELL DON'T BE!

102
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,021
I'll tell you, as a favor.
It's Ozaki!

103
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:13,296
Later!

104
00:15:42,765 --> 00:15:44,926
What a day...

105
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:46,500
Boss!

106
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:50,663
It's been too long!

107
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:53,264
You come by
yourself, Kuroko?

108
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:54,502
Hi, big brother!

109
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:58,002
You too, Megumi?

110
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:07,522
Nagumo...
You saved me!

111
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:11,857
Oh, thank you!

112
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:20,468
Bottom of the 8th.
How will Yamaki play it?

113
00:16:20,536 --> 00:16:22,868
The third pitch, and...

114
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:29,671
A hit! Going long!!
Going, going... gone!

115
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:38,550
So Megumi, do you know
who the Overfiend is?

116
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:41,481
- Sure!
- Really?

117
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:45,823
Since you bring it up,
what do YOU think?

118
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:47,889
Come on.

119
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:53,200
The Overfiend, who's been
sleeping for 3000 years?

120
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:54,827
Maybe he doesn't exist.

121
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:58,271
Cut the shit.
You've found him, right?

122
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,506
Hell yes! My nose's
extra-sensitive.

123
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:03,408
Better than yours.

124
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,075
Then let's bet on who
the real Overfiend is.

125
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:10,619
Suit yourself.

126
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:15,249
Good! If I win, we both go
back to the demon realm.

127
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:20,259
He's gotta
be the Overfiend...

128
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:25,597
That bullshit this afternoon'll
bring more demons here...

129
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:46,951
God dammit! Some guys
get all the luck!

130
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:51,217
What a horny bastard!

131
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,795
There you go. Enjoy.
Thanks a lot.

132
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,399
Here.

133
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:01,799
I'm not hungry.
Sorry.

134
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:04,966
Then I'll eat both.

135
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,648
It didn't happen!

136
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:19,978
Miss Togami turning
into that monster...

137
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:24,258
And what it did to me.

138
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:26,988
It didn't happen, right?
Say it wasn't real!

139
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:28,588
It wasn't!

140
00:18:28,664 --> 00:18:31,792
Come on, it was your
imagination or something.

141
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:33,664
Thank you.

142
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:44,008
Let's sit down.

143
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:50,276
Look, Akemi...

144
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:56,357
I've liked you for
a long time now!

145
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:08,362
The smell... The smell!
I'm sure of it!

146
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:11,271
It's that guy, all right.

147
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:15,336
Don't be embarrassed.
I'm glad you told me.

148
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,804
Great.

149
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:23,077
But I'm still afraid
it'll happen again...

150
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:26,383
Even if it was
just my imagination.

151
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:34,059
As long as I'm with you,
Akemi... I'll protect you.

152
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:37,559
You will protect me,
won't you, Nagumo?

153
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:39,396
Of course.

154
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:02,081
Ozaki...

155
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:06,558
Ozaki... Please...

156
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:13,565
You're different tonight,
Ozaki. A lot stronger.

157
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:17,428
I...!! Oh god!

158
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:47,126
What's going on?

159
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:05,747
What's happening?

160
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:08,517
My body...
What's wrong with me?!

161
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:44,515
So you're
the Overfiend, eh?

162
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:08,706
He's the Overfiend,
all right.

163
00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:12,209
But how do I
make him manifest?

164
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:41,208
Here he comes.
Now we'll get a good look.

165
00:23:33,969 --> 00:23:37,530
Boss, he ate
him so easily!

166
00:23:37,606 --> 00:23:40,302
What the...!
I don't get it!

167
00:24:01,463 --> 00:24:02,987
There he goes!

168
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:41,261
I finally found you!

169
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:49,770
Those punks were nothing.
Try me on for size!

170
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:16,597
It's the Overfiend,
all right!

171
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:28,799
I've found you!
At last, I've found you!

172
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,577
The hell...?
What's happening?!

173
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:49,488
No... It can't be!

174
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:25,266
Shit! And I really thought
he was the one!

175
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:31,730
Boss, he must've taken the blood
or semen of the real
Overfiend.

176
00:27:31,807 --> 00:27:35,038
That's why he had the
Overfiend's power.

177
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,841
Blood or semen...
Blood? You said BLOOD?

178
00:27:42,884 --> 00:27:43,851
Holy...

179
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:55,321
That guy's the Overfiend?
Oh, I can't take it anymore!

180
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:58,231
Don't look...

181
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:08,336
Who are you?

182
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:10,903
You don't remember,
after last night?

183
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:12,173
What?!

184
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:14,638
I've never...!

185
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:18,413
You jerk!

186
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:20,080
Akemi!

187
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:22,613
You're the Overfiend,
aren't you?

188
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:30,864
Take your real form, quick!

189
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:34,026
I've been waiting a long time
to get screwed by you!

190
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,431
Hey... Cut it out!

191
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:43,133
What's her problem?

192
00:28:45,513 --> 00:28:48,107
Maybe I should
take her up on it...

193
00:29:04,032 --> 00:29:06,967
No...
He's too far gone.

194
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:11,262
The EEG's flat.
The heartbeat has stopped.

195
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:12,704
"In Surgery"

196
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:15,509
We did all we could...

197
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:30,649
I didn't think
he could die.

198
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:34,151
Guess he wasn't
the Overfiend, either.

199
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,423
There IS no Overfiend!

200
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:39,490
Let's go back to
the demon realm.

201
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,041
What the...!
I sense a demon!

202
00:30:34,222 --> 00:30:35,655
What's wrong?!

203
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:43,253
It's so strong...! I've never
felt anything this strong!

204
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:38,279
Stop it...!

205
00:31:55,637 --> 00:31:59,300
After 3000 years rest,
I awaken!

206
00:32:07,982 --> 00:32:09,882
No! Stop it!

207
00:32:48,356 --> 00:32:52,850
My first in 3000 years!
How very, very sweet...

208
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:59,022
Oh man,
I'd better tell the boss!

209
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:05,999
Boss! I saw him!
Nagumo IS the Overfiend!

210
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,533
What?!

211
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,175
- I'll check this out!
- Wait for me!

212
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:15,580
I'll stay here.

213
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:56,914
Help me...!

214
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:04,125
Megumi!

215
00:35:27,649 --> 00:35:29,014
Well Megumi...

216
00:35:29,651 --> 00:35:32,347
I guess you won the bet...
