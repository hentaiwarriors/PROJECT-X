1
00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:03,971
Grandmother!

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,639
I won't be too long.

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,379
Grandmother!

4
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:14,054
Listen to me very carefully!

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,552
Grandmother!

6
00:00:16,624 --> 00:00:22,460
If Onimaro takes
Dominion over this world...

7
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:26,257
none will be able to survive it.

8
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:31,465
You both saw the hell
the city has become.

9
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,703
And it's only going to get worse
as time goes on.

10
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:43,115
Kijyu brought the Evil Sex Spirit
to force Onimaro to be their King.

11
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:49,619
Where Might is the master,
Justice is the servant.

12
00:00:49,857 --> 00:00:53,418
Do you think we have a chance
to get him back?

13
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:56,326
There's one thing you can do.

14
00:00:56,397 --> 00:00:59,798
But it's no guarantee.

15
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:04,770
Grandmother, does the King still
have memories of Onimaro?

16
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,502
That memory is the only way...

17
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:13,604
to help the world
and Onimaro himself.

18
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:17,378
Speaking to him could
get his memory back?

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,851
It's hard to say.

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:26,452
He has both Kijyu's blood
and our Tenjin's blood.

21
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:28,722
Ai, Mai...

22
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,727
Go back to the Amatsu House...

23
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,234
and find the room
underneath the alter.

24
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:43,039
That room didn't burst into flames.

25
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:47,673
Inside, seek out a pot of
a miracle plum tree.

26
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:53,585
You'll be protected by God
as long as you possess it!

27
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:58,114
Listen! Never give up on
believing in Tenjin!

28
00:01:58,192 --> 00:02:01,923
Believe in the true faith and the
Celestial Raiment of Twin Angels!

29
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:06,831
Both of you must
combine your powers.

30
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:09,335
Please help save Onimaro.

31
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:15,071
You two have already
taken over Tenjin's mission.

32
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,809
Grandmother!

33
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:17,867
Don't leave!

34
00:02:20,548 --> 00:02:25,008
I've got to go.
Please, carry out your tasks!

35
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,155
Grandmother!

36
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:41,327
She must be given her peace.
We have to let her go!

37
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:46,833
I'll crush the Kijyu who've taken
our grandmother's life from us.

38
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:48,665
I will too.

39
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:28,641
See me ride this pony.

40
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:33,614
Oh...oh...yeah...oh, yes!

41
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:41,090
You like it, you horny bitch...

42
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:44,957
Aaaah, so good!

43
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,467
My young Lord, can you hear me?
It's your guardian, Dekunobo.

44
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:10,112
Lord Onimaro.
Have you forgotten my voice?

45
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:12,853
It's Dekunobo, yours truly.

46
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:22,198
Since you were born,
we have done everything together.

47
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,704
Remember the sounds
of the breeze...

48
00:04:24,772 --> 00:04:27,969
that echoed in the forest
where we played...?

49
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:55,394
Lord, you can't drown in the
shallow area. Stand up and see...

50
00:04:58,205 --> 00:05:01,800
Lord, my Lord!
Please wake up!

51
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:12,985
Oh, thank God...

52
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:16,282
I am hungry, Dekunobo.

53
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:21,294
Oh, yes, yes!
Let's grill some fish right now.

54
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,265
Here, Lord.

55
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:38,506
This is good for your little prick.
Eat up!

56
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,630
Lord Onimaro!
Do you remember?

57
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,300
Please remember...

58
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,311
Remember the time
when you almost died?

59
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:16,373
I stayed up all night
at your side.

60
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,192
Dekunobo...

61
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,829
I'm right here, Lord!

62
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:41,875
I thought you went away.

63
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:44,103
Don't be ridiculous, Lord.

64
00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:48,075
Where would I go without you?

65
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,415
As your guardian,
I will never, ever, leave your side.

66
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:54,351
Please relax.

67
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:58,450
Am I...going to...die...?

68
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:01,321
You are NOT going to die.

69
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:06,298
You are the flesh and blood
a direct descendent of Tenjin God.

70
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:11,236
His good will has blessed your soul.
You won't die over a silly flu.

71
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:17,474
God will have to take my life
before yours!

72
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,714
I had the strangest dream.

73
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:28,312
Beasts with scary faces were
trying to take me away.

74
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:29,549
What!?

75
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:34,993
And all of them had horns like me.
They were very nice to me, though.

76
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,051
My Lord!

77
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:45,699
I was wrong to keep you in
exile like this at his tender age.

78
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:49,174
I must take you out of the woods
and provide some female company.

79
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:54,476
The Tenjin nuns will be
happy to take care of you.

80
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:01,816
My Lord, you must remember.

81
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:05,556
Our King!
What is the matter?

82
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,962
You don't look so well...

83
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,934
Is this Orgy Ceremony
wearing off on you?

84
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,301
Who is Onimaro?

85
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:23,176
Who is Dekunobo?

86
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,536
Who AM I?

87
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:34,779
You are the Master who binds all
of Universe with the Indecent Spirits.

88
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:38,382
The one and only
King of Kijyu Demons.

89
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,397
What is the matter, King?

90
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:58,645
I almost forgot!

91
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:03,608
King,

92
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:09,850
how about some mature woman
if you're tried of virgins.

93
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,651
Please get a piece of
this ripe pussy.

94
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,189
There... look.

95
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,769
Nice and juicy on the outside,
smooth and tight on the inside.

96
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,273
I have personally
prepared this one.

97
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,538
Please, have yourself a ball.

98
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:46,557
Sir Tokihira.

99
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,857
Have Ai and Mai shown up yet?

100
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,921
I thought you two were
delivering them yourselves.

101
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:54,126
They got away.

102
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:57,296
Ai...Mai...

103
00:09:57,905 --> 00:09:59,930
Ai? Mai?

104
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,009
Do you recognize the names?

105
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:06,104
Vaguely...

106
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:10,045
That's possible.

107
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:16,380
They are the infamous Tenjin sisters
that have caused us much trouble.

108
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,887
Enemies!

109
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:21,492
Indeed!

110
00:10:21,562 --> 00:10:27,296
I had planned to make a special
sacrifices of them to you, King.

111
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:32,035
Beasts, do not spoil the party!

112
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:37,635
Get that horny professor
over here for the King.

113
00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:39,679
What is the matter?

114
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,244
The King is not himself.

115
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:48,721
If he should regain his past memory,
our ritual will not be consummated!

116
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:49,915
But we have Sutra...

117
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,983
Of course! Sutra!

118
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,749
Such an eager beaver.

119
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:45,344
Queen of Seduction, after all.

120
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:49,348
Kama, mix a bit of Kijyu potion
with the wine...

121
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,884
and give it to our King.

122
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:53,180
As you say.

123
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,715
We must not allow
any more mishap.

124
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:02,617
Oh, did I mention about old Gensyu?
She's quite finished.

125
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,561
Oh, yes?

126
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:07,500
Not Gensyu!

127
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:11,165
Well done, Kama.

128
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:14,469
She must be dead as
a door nail by now.

129
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,738
Here we have the Tenjin nuns,
begging for more.

130
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:21,406
They are a disgrace to Tenjin.

131
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:25,350
True, true. Now we only need to
take care of Ai and Mai.

132
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:31,119
We don't need to look further.
They're bound to show up for revenge.

133
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,756
Curiosity killed the...pussy.

134
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:41,996
We have already laid the traps.
The Raiment is useless against them.

135
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:47,366
The wine!
Bring on the wine!

136
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,200
Be gone, Demons!

137
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:32,519
Here comes Tenjin!

138
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:34,679
Bestow us the power, Lord!

139
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,948
Finally!

140
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:48,198
Show yourselves, Ai, Mai.

141
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,472
Demons that spread
the Evil Orgy Spirit!

142
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,705
We, the Tenjin Twin Angels, will be
the punishing hands of our Lord!!

143
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,111
For the sake of Gensyu!

144
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:02,170
Beware!

145
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,014
Such kidders.

146
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,446
Why don't we reunite you sisters
with your old granny.

147
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:42,783
No escape!

148
00:15:12,753 --> 00:15:14,015
Sister!

149
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:19,117
You just fell into our hands,
Ai, Mai.

150
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:26,362
Take down the sacrifices.

151
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:30,234
I want them! I want them!

152
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:37,371
Tonight's main course,
it's all yours.

153
00:15:40,714 --> 00:15:42,011
You bastard!

154
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:43,716
Damn you!

155
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:54,224
Miss Ai! Miss Mai!

156
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,089
Dekunobo!!

157
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:15,506
Lord Onimaro
no longer remembers...

158
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,416
You mustn't, Lord Onimaro!

159
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:22,850
Get away!

160
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:26,215
No, I will never!

161
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:30,753
What are you going to do to them?
You owe your life to them.

162
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:32,523
Rape them!!

163
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,430
You have lost your mind,
Lord Onimaro.

164
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:38,265
Who? Onimaro? Fuck off!.

165
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:41,904
No, I will not budge!

166
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:47,072
If you want to get to them, then
you'll have to get through me first.

167
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:54,284
Stupid Onimaro!

168
00:16:54,354 --> 00:16:56,549
Dekunobo, just go!

169
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,991
Come on, beasts. Kill him.

170
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,231
Dekunobo!!

171
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:28,145
Lord...no,
you heartless Kijyu King!

172
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,852
I am so...ashamed...

173
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:46,271
Wise old Gensyu,
I am so...sorry...

174
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,934
No!

175
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,381
Onimaro, you idiot!

176
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:17,901
Where are Ai and Mai?
I want them right now.

177
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:23,205
They are not going anywhere.

178
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:26,439
How about a little foreplay,
Master?

179
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:30,210
I'll put on a show for you.

180
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:39,385
That is, those sisters deserve
more than just regular deflowering.

181
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:46,797
We must return all the trouble
they caused us...ten-fold!

182
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:51,426
Beasts, prepare the torture sets.

183
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:03,173
Those are what we call
''cherry eel,'' a Kijyu creature.

184
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:08,586
They can sniff out virgin pussies
and penetrate them...

185
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:14,525
only to tear off their cherries,
if you know what I mean...

186
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:16,590
Bring in the sisters!

187
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,241
Sister!

188
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,043
Oh, what a sight, Ai.

189
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:50,556
Tenjin Angel,
show us your Raiment dance, eh?

190
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,055
How interesting...

191
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:17,248
Sister!

192
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:25,227
Watch closely, my dear.
You're next, Mai!

193
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:27,224
Sister...!

194
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:31,197
Sister...

195
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:19,209
Oh, that tight pussy
has choked them.

196
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:24,046
Sister!!

197
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,651
Kama, get her out of the tank.

198
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:32,391
We're not finished with her, yet.

199
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,964
Oh...no...

200
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:18,910
No...no!!

201
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,678
Sister!

202
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,239
Your Highness, look.

203
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,617
I see you approve...

204
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:48,398
No!

205
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:52,233
Now it's your turn to look.

206
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:54,166
Mai...

207
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:57,634
No...

208
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:00,944
Mai...

209
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,640
Enjoy the ride, Angel.

210
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:11,746
Mai!

211
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:18,029
Sister!

212
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:22,632
Oh, what a lovely view...

213
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:37,983
No!!

214
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:56,629
Such sublime pleasure!

215
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,189
Mai!!

216
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:55,354
I wish that someday I would be
able to look you straight in the eye

217
00:25:57,397 --> 00:26:07,568
Instead, I'm running away,
speeding my bike like a fool

218
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:19,618
''Shall we walk together?''
you said and smiled

219
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,352
Such a coward I am

220
00:26:26,426 --> 00:26:32,661
I couldn't answer your smile
with honesty

221
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:38,330
Good-bye, weak girl
I can only run away and hide

222
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:45,169
The wind against my cheeks
whispers how I fail my heart

223
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:55,785
And with the words of courage,
lifts my fears and regrets

224
00:26:57,156 --> 00:27:02,788
''I'll give you good luck.''
Maybe tomorrow, I say to the wind

225
00:27:02,862 --> 00:27:07,731
Maybe I can open up
and tell him that

226
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:14,569
My actions are really
the opposite of my true feelings

227
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:20,307
That I really, truly, love you

228
00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:45,734
No!

229
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:49,605
Now it's your turn to look.

230
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:51,537
Mai...

231
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,472
No!!

232
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:58,281
Mai!

233
00:27:59,018 --> 00:28:02,010
Ready angel?
Enjoy the ride, Tenjin slut.

234
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:09,826
Mai!

235
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,558
Sister!

236
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,103
Oh, what a lovely view...

237
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:34,146
No...no!!

238
00:28:51,637 --> 00:28:53,901
Such sublime pleasure!

239
00:29:11,824 --> 00:29:14,622
She appears to be
unconscious, my lord.

240
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:20,491
I can't wait any more!
Give me the sisters!

241
00:29:22,568 --> 00:29:27,369
Don't rush, my King.
They are not going anywhere.

242
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:34,003
It's no fun raping those sisters
in their sleep.

243
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,140
We applied some potion
on their pussies...

244
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:41,312
which will burn their inside with
such overwhelming lust that...

245
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:43,878
they'll be begging for it.

246
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:49,861
And once you stick it in, they'll be
wriggling their asses like whores.

247
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:56,664
Ai and Mai will be
wriggling their asses like whores...!

248
00:29:56,736 --> 00:30:00,729
Yes. I just knew
you would like that.

249
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:04,504
But before you eat the cake...

250
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:11,346
we must first proceed with your
Rite of Ascension to the Kingdom!

251
00:30:32,438 --> 00:30:37,375
As the King of Kijyu, you will
reign over the Sex Orgy World.

252
00:30:37,443 --> 00:30:42,904
You shall now command all evil
forces to spread over Universe,

253
00:30:42,982 --> 00:30:48,943
and carry on this mission till we erect
the infinite world of lust and orgy.

254
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:35,232
What is this...?

255
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:37,629
Miss Ai!

256
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:42,432
Dekunobo, you're okay!?

257
00:31:42,508 --> 00:31:44,442
I can't believe it myself.

258
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,172
- Help Mai.
- Certainly.

259
00:31:55,221 --> 00:31:58,247
I am the King of Kijyu!

260
00:31:58,324 --> 00:32:03,455
I shall lead this world
into infinite evil and lust!

261
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,424
Congratulations!

262
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,767
You have been crowned
with the coveted Kijyu throne!

263
00:32:12,838 --> 00:32:16,638
Oh, how long
I have awaited this day!

264
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:21,442
How long we the
Kijyu Clan have waited...

265
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:27,042
I want Ai and Mai, NOW.

266
00:32:27,286 --> 00:32:29,083
Yes!

267
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:31,755
Bring in the sisters!

268
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,155
Yes, Sir.

269
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:41,564
And now my lord, I will gladly
present you the ritual sacrifice!

270
00:32:41,634 --> 00:32:47,630
Do what your wild heart desires,
do those pussies until they rip!

271
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:51,136
What happened?

272
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,576
They're nowhere to be found,
my lord.

273
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:54,977
No!

274
00:32:56,215 --> 00:33:00,777
Search! They couldn't have
gone too far. FI ND THEM!

275
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,351
Get me Ai and Mai!

276
00:33:08,427 --> 00:33:12,261
Y-yes! Search!
Search them out.

277
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,834
Without sacrificing
those Tenjin Angels...

278
00:33:15,901 --> 00:33:18,267
the ceremony is not complete.

279
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:19,429
Indeed!

280
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:38,019
- Women...
- Get lost!

281
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:55,035
Search with your
noses to the ground!

282
00:34:01,947 --> 00:34:04,074
Just a sleeping bum.

283
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:14,416
Miss Ai, Miss Mai,
I have disappointed you both.

284
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:20,929
It is all my fault. If only I had
taken better care of Lord Onimaro.

285
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,596
Please, chin up, Dekunobo.

286
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:28,431
We are grateful that you're alive.

287
00:34:28,507 --> 00:34:33,843
They defiled the poor nuns and...
and now even you sisters...

288
00:34:33,913 --> 00:34:37,474
I let them subject you to such...
such shameful acts.

289
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,214
And now they've killed Gensyu
after all she's done for me...

290
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:48,284
And failing my Lord.
What a pathetic piece of shit I am.

291
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:52,692
But Dekunobo,
we can't give up yet.

292
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:56,000
We have to keep believing
in the miracle of Tenjin.

293
00:34:56,068 --> 00:34:58,969
It will save us
as Grandmother promised.

294
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,736
The miracle of Tenjin...

295
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:07,242
You mean his good will is
still left in this hellish world?

296
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,773
We were filled with thoughts
of revenge, Dekunobo.

297
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:14,615
We had forgotten
Grandmother's last words...

298
00:35:14,687 --> 00:35:16,382
Gensyu's last words...?

299
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:20,184
She mentioned a pot
containing a plum tree...

300
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:23,194
hidden in the burned down alter
at the temple.

301
00:35:23,262 --> 00:35:25,059
Let's look for it together.

302
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:30,091
We still have a chance at restoring
light and peace to the world.

303
00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:32,231
At your service!

304
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:50,412
Sister!

305
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:53,856
There it is.

306
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:57,089
Stand back, I'll get it.

307
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:04,334
We found them!

308
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,651
Dekunobo,
you get the plum pot!

309
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:23,051
- Let us take care of them!
- All right!

310
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,700
Here, Miss Ai, Miss Mai.

311
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:54,749
It's not safe here. Let's go
to the Temple, to grandmother.

312
00:37:13,973 --> 00:37:16,032
What a hellish sight!

313
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:24,238
Sister, we'd better transform.

314
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,447
Right!

315
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:30,917
Here comes Tenjin.

316
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:33,485
Here comes Tenjin.

317
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,120
The Raiment of Twin Angels!

318
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,962
Miss Ai, Miss Mai.

319
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:43,467
Women!

320
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,797
We can't transform...?

321
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,139
We have been so shamed
by the sex demons...

322
00:37:52,211 --> 00:37:55,669
that the Raiment must have
lost its power to transform us.

323
00:37:55,748 --> 00:38:00,617
In that case, we better run as fast
as we can. Follow me this way!

324
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:15,757
There! Don't let them get away!

325
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:54,102
This is pure hell...
the world is in chaos.

326
00:38:58,677 --> 00:39:00,474
It feels...so...good...

327
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:07,347
Oh Gensyu!

328
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:12,585
I am so ashamed!

329
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,019
Grandmother...

330
00:39:15,094 --> 00:39:19,463
after what they did to you,
I almost lost my mind.

331
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:24,730
In the heat of vengeance,
I have exposed Mai to such impurity.

332
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,637
It's not your fault, sister.

333
00:39:27,706 --> 00:39:32,700
I also lost control of my senses
trying to avenge Grandmother's death.

334
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:39,974
- Look! The plum tree!
- It's a miracle!

335
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:48,453
Look, Grandmother is weeping!

336
00:39:48,527 --> 00:39:50,358
Grandmother, are you alive!?

337
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:54,422
- Grandmother!
- Grandmother!!

338
00:39:57,169 --> 00:40:01,697
I am no longer of this world.

339
00:40:02,374 --> 00:40:03,671
Grandmother!

340
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:09,670
Nevertheless, I am always
with you in spirit, Ai and Mai.

341
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:13,377
How could I leave you?

342
00:40:16,722 --> 00:40:22,683
Ai, Mai, you must defeat Kijyu
and restore the world to peace.

343
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:23,785
Don't give up.

344
00:40:24,163 --> 00:40:28,259
But, we have disgraced you...

345
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:33,498
and the holy Raiment
you bestowed upon us.

346
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:37,406
I am sorry...I am so sorry...

347
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,741
We have lost our powers
as Tenjin Angels.

348
00:40:41,513 --> 00:40:44,971
We can't transform
because they...

349
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,382
We are so sorry, Grandmother.

350
00:40:47,686 --> 00:40:49,483
Do not despair.

351
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:54,288
That plum tree will
provide new Raiment.

352
00:41:04,703 --> 00:41:06,694
The heavenly maidens!

353
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:21,582
Those maidens will weave you
the new celestial Raiment.

354
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:23,383
Really?

355
00:41:23,455 --> 00:41:27,391
Wear it and
face those Kijyu demons.

356
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,753
With the blessed Raiment and
the power of Tenjin Enlightenment,

357
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,424
you must restore faith to the world.

358
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,335
- Tenjin Enlightenment...
- Blessed Raiment!

359
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,836
To wear such a sacred gift
from God...

360
00:41:40,906 --> 00:41:44,842
you must first recite the
ancient Tenjin incantations...

361
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,775
passed on in the Amatsu family.

362
00:41:47,112 --> 00:41:49,444
The ancient Tenjin incantations...?

363
00:41:49,515 --> 00:41:51,312
Words of living souls.

364
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:57,344
Once spoken, they release the
souls from the Temple of Tenjin...

365
00:41:57,422 --> 00:42:02,519
who will answer your prayers and
protect you through your mission.

366
00:42:02,594 --> 00:42:05,324
You mean we're not fighting
all alone, Grandmother?

367
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:12,527
Just remember that all of
Heaven is behind you in your battle.

368
00:42:12,871 --> 00:42:17,570
Ai, Mai, as the maidens weave,

369
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:22,371
I shall teach you these holy words.

370
00:42:22,447 --> 00:42:27,510
Repeat them as if they were
the last words you will ever speak!

371
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,883
Yes!

372
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:31,214
Miss Ai, Miss Mai,

373
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:37,286
I will do my best to
not let the demons disturb you.

374
00:42:37,362 --> 00:42:41,025
The fate of our world is
in your hands!

375
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:43,962
So long.

376
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:52,575
We call to the ends of the skies above
upon the heavenly Tenjin mistresses!

377
00:42:52,644 --> 00:42:58,446
And we call upon the army saints,
a hundred-strong, of Tenjin!

378
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:04,053
We call to the ends of the skies above
upon the heavenly Tenjin mistresses!

379
00:43:04,122 --> 00:43:08,786
And we call upon the army saints,
a hundred-strong, of Tenjin!

380
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:20,402
Servants of Tenjin,
such as the master saint of chivalry.

381
00:43:21,373 --> 00:43:25,707
Servants of Tenjin,
such as the master saint of chivalry.

382
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:40,448
Under the spell of the moon,
those who have fallen to earth,

383
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:44,551
Under the spell of the moon,
those who have fallen to earth,

384
00:43:49,434 --> 00:43:52,403
are to be purified by you all,
to be rid of their sins!

385
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,602
are to be purified by you all,
to be rid of their sins!

386
00:43:57,409 --> 00:44:00,435
May you all hear,
the servants of Tenjin!

387
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:03,507
May you all hear,
the servants of Tenjin!

388
00:44:34,246 --> 00:44:35,838
There he is!

389
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:39,242
With one foot in the grave.

390
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:43,177
I, Dekunobo, am here to fight.

391
00:44:43,255 --> 00:44:47,521
But first, I have something to say
to the King of Kijyu.

392
00:44:47,592 --> 00:44:49,253
Let me see him!

393
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:58,860
You don't know when to say when.
Where are Ai and Mai?

394
00:44:58,937 --> 00:45:06,139
Perhaps, you'd like to join
in our festivities, eh?

395
00:45:08,347 --> 00:45:13,512
King of Kijyu! Who was once
my beloved Lord Onimaro!

396
00:45:13,618 --> 00:45:19,614
I claim your life with my own hands,
and you can take mine as well!

397
00:45:20,258 --> 00:45:21,247
What...?

398
00:45:24,363 --> 00:45:29,767
Lord Onimaro, destroy me with
your own flesh and blood if you can!

399
00:45:50,255 --> 00:45:54,521
Don't just stand there!
Kill him! Rip him to pieces!

400
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,830
We will reunite in death.

401
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:10,534
Ai and Mai must be in there!

402
00:46:11,076 --> 00:46:15,012
You demons of Kijyu who have
brought hell upon this earth...

403
00:46:16,548 --> 00:46:22,145
We the sisters of Tenjin Clan will
put an end to your misery.

404
00:46:24,222 --> 00:46:26,213
Oh, how cute.

405
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:31,252
Do you really think the two of
you can conquer our evil empire...

406
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:33,024
with your little trick?

407
00:46:33,098 --> 00:46:35,760
Where are they?

408
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,324
Over there!

409
00:46:42,874 --> 00:46:46,207
Ai Amatsu, before your eyes.

410
00:46:50,048 --> 00:46:52,073
Mai Amatsu, in the flesh.

411
00:46:52,617 --> 00:46:54,448
Attack! Attack!!

412
00:46:54,753 --> 00:46:56,482
Just try it you beasts!

413
00:46:59,524 --> 00:47:00,889
Why, you!

414
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,684
Make my day!

415
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:14,370
How dare you!
I'll whip your ass!

416
00:47:25,317 --> 00:47:26,841
You sluts!

417
00:47:35,594 --> 00:47:37,323
No escape!

418
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,734
Kama!

419
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:02,051
Kama!!

420
00:48:14,966 --> 00:48:16,627
Don't let them get away!

421
00:48:18,837 --> 00:48:21,965
Ai...Mai...!!

422
00:48:28,647 --> 00:48:32,048
Mai, we'll recite
the incantation now, okay?

423
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,448
Yes.

424
00:48:33,652 --> 00:48:38,487
We call to the ends of the skies above
upon the heavenly Tenjin mistresses!

425
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:43,591
And we call upon the army saints,
a hundred-strong, of Tenjin!

426
00:48:44,062 --> 00:48:55,564
Such as the master saints of chivalry,
of exorcism, of Time, and of Space.

427
00:48:56,374 --> 00:48:59,502
All that serve and
follow the teachings of Tenjin.

428
00:48:59,578 --> 00:49:02,547
Crimes committed by demons of Kijyu!

429
00:49:03,481 --> 00:49:07,315
Under the spell of the Tenjin moon,
those who have fallen to earth,

430
00:49:07,385 --> 00:49:10,946
are to be purified by you all,
to be rid of their sins!

431
00:49:17,963 --> 00:49:21,763
Under the spell of the Tenjin moon,
those who have fallen to earth,

432
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:26,403
must be purified by you all,
to be rid of their sins!

433
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,271
Now we cleanse all harm done
against Tenjin.

434
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:40,012
Restore the light on this land
and crush the darkness!!

435
00:49:43,622 --> 00:49:49,356
King! Why, you Tenjin bitches!

436
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:55,192
Gone with Tenjin!
Welcome the Kingdom of Evil!

437
00:50:05,277 --> 00:50:08,576
How's that, Sister?
Go ahead and enjoy it.

438
00:50:13,652 --> 00:50:16,280
Ah...how sweet...

439
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:18,379
Sister...?

440
00:50:21,293 --> 00:50:23,261
I feel...so...good...

441
00:50:25,697 --> 00:50:28,825
Evil be gone!
Here comes Tenjin!!

442
00:50:30,635 --> 00:50:36,631
Don't be fooled by the illusion.
They can't ruin our incantation!

443
00:50:37,108 --> 00:50:39,008
Okay, sister.

444
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,509
Those who sin against Tenjin...

445
00:50:43,148 --> 00:50:45,616
Be cleansed! Be gone!

446
00:50:45,684 --> 00:50:49,745
Tenjin God erect the Column
of Enlightenment.

447
00:50:50,221 --> 00:50:52,621
Evil be gone! Kijyu be gone!

448
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:57,557
Tenjin God erect the Column
of Enlightenment!

449
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:02,766
What is this...?

450
00:51:05,337 --> 00:51:07,202
It's the great light of Tenjin!

451
00:51:15,547 --> 00:51:19,210
The Evil Spirit,
brought on by Kijyu...

452
00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:22,918
Tenjin has shown you the way out:
follow it!

453
00:51:26,157 --> 00:51:29,285
Evil Spirit, this land is ours!

454
00:51:58,423 --> 00:52:00,050
You sisters!

455
00:52:00,425 --> 00:52:01,619
Here comes Tenjin!

456
00:52:01,693 --> 00:52:02,955
Twin Angels!

457
00:52:07,232 --> 00:52:08,790
Of the Blessed Raiment!!

458
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:12,065
- Be gone, Evil Spirit!
- Ready?

459
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:20,243
Be gone, Evil Spirit!!

460
00:52:21,045 --> 00:52:23,775
King, but why?

461
00:52:23,882 --> 00:52:25,110
Why...!

462
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,124
Why!

463
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:07,617
Miss Ai, Miss Mai...
What is happening to our lord?

464
00:53:26,544 --> 00:53:28,068
Miss Ai, Miss Mai!

465
00:53:42,794 --> 00:53:44,659
Lord Onimaro!

466
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,463
It's really you.

467
00:53:48,533 --> 00:53:50,433
Ouch!

468
00:53:51,202 --> 00:53:54,638
Hey Mai! Hey Ai!
Why are you crying?

469
00:53:56,808 --> 00:53:59,743
What a terrible dream I had.

470
00:54:01,513 --> 00:54:02,741
You fool.

471
00:54:04,249 --> 00:54:09,016
Oh, oh, Dekunobo!
I have to pee bad, hurry.

472
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:13,548
Just a second,
hold it in, hold it in...

473
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,987
Um...Dekunobo!

474
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:17,825
Lord!

475
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:19,827
I'm all wet...

476
00:54:20,031 --> 00:54:21,464
Sister.

477
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,502
We did it, Grandmother.

478
00:54:32,377 --> 00:54:34,470
Thank you, Grandmother.

479
00:55:04,776 --> 00:55:14,879
I wish that someday I would be
able to look you straight in the eye

480
00:55:16,721 --> 00:55:27,097
Instead, I'm running away,
speeding my bike like a fool

481
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:38,634
''Shall we walk together?''
you said and smiled

482
00:55:40,078 --> 00:55:45,710
Such a coward I am

483
00:55:45,783 --> 00:55:52,018
I couldn't answer your smile
with honesty

484
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:57,687
Good-bye, weak girl
I can only run away and hide

485
00:55:57,962 --> 00:56:04,526
The wind against my cheeks
whispers how I fail my heart

486
00:56:04,902 --> 00:56:15,142
And with the words of courage,
lifts my fears and regrets

487
00:56:16,514 --> 00:56:22,146
''I'll give you good luck.''
Maybe tomorrow, I say to the wind

488
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:27,089
Maybe I can open up
and tell him that

489
00:56:27,158 --> 00:56:33,654
My actions are really
the opposite of my true feelings

490
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:39,670
That I really, truly, love you
