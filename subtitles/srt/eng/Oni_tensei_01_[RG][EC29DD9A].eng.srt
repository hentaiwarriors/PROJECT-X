1
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,157
Just as I thought...

2
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,531
This is what I've been seeking.

3
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:23,760
Wonderful!

4
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,033
How awful...

5
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,509
Hey, don't step over the dead bodies!

6
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,605
S-Sorry.

7
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,247
Come to think of it, that
was the beginning of it all.

8
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,218
If I didn't work on that case...

9
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,515
...I'd never have quit...

10
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,584
...being a detective.

11
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,854
There are 13 victims.

12
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,826
They're from the same yakuza group.

13
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,791
It's probably a gang war.

14
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,128
Any witnesses?

15
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:15,839
None.

16
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,935
The restaurant's owner
downstairs reported it.

17
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,509
He discovered blood
dripping from the ceiling.

18
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,711
Were they high or something?

19
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:27,574
Why?

20
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,484
It's strange that
there are no witnesses.

21
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,120
And a simple fight
wouldn't be <i>so</i> terrible...

22
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,685
How can you be <i>so</i> calm?

23
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,494
I'm not.

24
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,131
Is Kure here?

25
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:41,765
Yes .

26
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:44,663
Come here.

27
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,070
A girl?

28
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,904
Yes, we found her at
the scene before you two came.

29
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,906
Can you take care of her?

30
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:55,645
Yes .

31
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,727
I'm Reiko Kure, from the Shinjuku precinct.

32
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,895
Thank you very much.

33
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,964
You are safe now.

34
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,737
We're going to the hospital.

35
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,737
Do you feel all right?

36
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,539
I'll get you some new clothes.

37
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,306
Tell me anything.

38
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,748
I'll help you as much as I can.

39
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:41,721
Don't touch me!

40
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,319
I'm sorry, but...

41
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,503
Leave me alone.

42
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,636
Okay, I see...

43
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,371
So, what's her name?

44
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,972
Nozomi Ema...

45
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,638
Mei how private school?

46
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:04,774
Yes .

47
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,915
A private school in Kyoto.

48
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,045
I remember the uniform.

49
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,746
Yes...

50
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:11,946
Yes...

51
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,386
She's about to see a doctor now.

52
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,852
Can you change by yourself?

53
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,300
A female doctor is coming.

54
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,099
Just a moment.

55
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,163
Flo!

56
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:02,668
What's wrong?

57
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,007
W-What are you, no...

58
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:17,887
Flo!

59
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,432
She might've been kept
there for a long time...

60
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,894
I'll keep my eye on her for a while.

61
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,702
Please, someone help!

62
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,303
N-No...

63
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,634
No...

64
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,380
What happened?

65
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,680
Get yourself together!

66
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:46,411
Where is she?

67
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,247
Where is the girl?

68
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,157
Are you okay?

69
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,294
What's the matter?

70
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,810
What are you doing?

71
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,106
Hey...

72
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,346
Stop.

73
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,017
Slop it!

74
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,749
Hey!

75
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,617
Don't disturb me!

76
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,260
Leave me alone!

77
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,235
T-That is...

78
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,491
Hey, stop <i>m</i>

79
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,392
slop it!

80
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:06,762
Let go!

81
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:07,330
Flo!

82
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:07,919
Let go of me!

83
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,796
Are you okay?
Let go of me!

84
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:09,554
Yes...

85
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,865
Please leave me alone!
Yes...

86
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:12,557
Let go of me!

87
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,764
At the time...
Let go of me!

88
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,969
...I was really angry.

89
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:16,505
Hey!

90
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:17,571
Let's go!

91
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,532
But not at Nozomi Ema...

92
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,770
...at whoever had
done this awful thing to her.

93
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,076
That tattoo of an ogre...

94
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,555
I got some information.

95
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,317
Nozomi Ema has been
missing for three months.

96
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,156
<i>So</i> have her parents...

97
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,962
She's been held captive...

98
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,728
...by those yakuza.

99
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,597
Why do you think that?

100
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:45,996
She has...

101
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,996
She has the same eyes that I have.

102
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,671
That's why you care <i>so</i> much.

103
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,208
I' m sorry.

104
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,310
Nozomi Ema was...

105
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,607
"hospitalized because
she might hurt others.

106
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,619
What's your opinion?

107
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,157
Do you think she's dangerous?

108
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,421
Could you talk to her?

109
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,521
Anyway, we're in trouble because she's
the only witness and we can't use her.

110
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,667
Cancel her hospitalization!

111
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:23,768
I think she was nervous
because she had just been rescued.

112
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,209
You want to take responsibility for her?

113
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:27,977
Yes !

114
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,212
Okay-

115
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:34,109
We'll start over from
the tattoo and the yakuza.

116
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,119
Yes .

117
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:50,559
Come on.

118
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,521
I've decided that I'll take
care of you for a while.

119
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:24,098
You don't want to stay
in a cold room, do you?

120
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,397
I want to help you.

121
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,200
It's not just my job.

122
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,504
I want to know about you...

123
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,010
...as a friend.

124
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,513
You' ll regret it.

125
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,874
No, I won't.

126
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,987
Long time no see, Reiko.

127
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,057
I'm sorry, I'm asking for your help again.

128
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,928
No problem.

129
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,328
Are you Nozomi?

130
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,401
Let me introduce you.

131
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,601
She is the head sister, Yasuko Kurisu.

132
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,295
Nice to meet you.

133
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,045
She'll take good care of you.

134
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:10,744
How are you?

135
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,182
It's a 20 year-old man who
lived nearby, he was unemployed.

136
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,920
His roommate identified him.

137
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,657
Two days in a row, this is too much...

138
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,858
The skin on his back...

139
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,501
Yes, actually...

140
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:39,135
I've heard he had a tattoo of
a Japanese demon on his back.

141
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:40,940
Tattoo?

142
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,211
Coincidence?

143
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:57,352
Oh no...

144
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,422
Blackout?

145
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,416
What's wrong?

146
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,086
I'm okay, just leave.

147
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,488
Do you feel all right?

148
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,748
Please, leave me alone!

149
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,190
Don't come close!

150
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,154
Don't be scared.

151
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,361
It's just a blackout.

152
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,128
Flo!

153
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,027
W-What?

154
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,035
N-Nozomi...

155
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,276
Stop it...

156
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:52,578
Oh no!

157
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,823
No...

158
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:48,864
N-No!

159
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:03,817
I'm coming!

160
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,382
I'm coming!

161
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,154
Die!

162
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:20,895
Who are you?

163
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,465
I came to take...

164
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,569
...your Ogre!

165
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,712
R-Run!

166
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,350
Flo!

167
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,119
Get off me!

168
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,056
Nozomi, run!

169
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,091
Run!

170
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,037
Get in!

171
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,345
Hold on!

172
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,290
No, stop it!

173
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:39,844
Don't move!

174
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,589
Shinjuku No. 8 to headquarters...

175
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:52,757
It's Kure.

176
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:53,928
I need backup.

177
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,058
We're in South Oui, Shinagawa.

178
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:00,836
We' re safe now.

179
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,035
Did you get hurt?

180
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:06,504
I'm fine...

181
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:07,435
Show me.

182
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,678
What happened?

183
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,849
That man tried to kill you, didn't he?

184
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,084
Do you know why?

185
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,220
Is that...

186
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,928
...the same man?

187
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,125
No...

188
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,092
What?

189
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:33,833
What's wrong?

190
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,202
No...

191
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,539
No, don't come out...

192
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:41,771
Don't!

193
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,643
No...

194
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,291
No...

195
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:23,437
No...

196
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,506
Flo!

197
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,086
Flo!

198
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,499
No, stop it!

199
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,268
No, stop it!

200
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,608
It's your fault.

201
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,077
He always whispers
in my ear from my back...

202
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,148
"More, I want more."

203
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,521
I usually try to keep him
quiet by touching myself...

204
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:41,516
But...

205
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,286
It's him!

206
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,959
...he gets out of my
body and hurts people.

207
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,260
Yes...

208
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,260
The nurse...

209
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:53,793
...and those yakuza...

210
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,269
They were attacked by my ogre...

211
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,107
Please...

212
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,509
Don't...

213
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,315
Please, stop it!

214
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,360
Flo!

215
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,056
Don't look at me!

216
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,972
It's your fault.

217
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,872
It's your...

218
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,507
N-No, please don't...

219
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,882
It's your...

220
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,612
Don't look...

221
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:45,853
No...

222
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,501
That's why I told you...

223
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,004
...to leave me alone.

224
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,260
I couldn't believe it.

225
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,094
Is it possible?

226
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,302
Can a tattoo be alive?

227
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,105
However...

228
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,708
...my body remembers...

229
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,782
...that the ogre pierced me.

230
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,878
When I think about
her life with the ogre...

231
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,117
...my heart feels...

232
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,087
...such deep sympathy.
