1
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:12,954
Regarding what has happened
at the Swallowtail Inn so far...

2
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:17,864
So many things happened...

3
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:22,065
and the more I remember,
the more I think about it...

4
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:31,512
...the hotter I feel, and the
wetter I become between my legs.

5
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:46,288
Now then, let's move on. What
will become of the Swallowtail Inn?

6
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:54,094
SWALLOWTAIL INN
2nd Night

7
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:14,790
This is my younger
sister, Fuyuka Shiratori.

8
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,789
To tell you the truth, we're sisters-in-law
with a complex relationship.

9
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:23,256
O-Only employees are supposed
to be using the bath now!

10
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:25,834
Never mind that...

11
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:28,371
Listen, what do you want me to do?

12
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:33,137
Fuyuka, what do you think you're doing?

13
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:37,408
I'm offering a special service. Part of
the Swallowtail Inn's secret attraction!

14
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,744
W-Wait, whatare you doing?

15
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,316
Fuyuka, stop it right now!

16
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,988
He's not one of our customers!

17
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:59,259
I know, I said it was a special service!

18
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:22,289
Y-Yuriko!

19
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:23,255
Fuyuka!

20
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:25,756
Hey, what are you doing?

21
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:27,855
This is how it's done!

22
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:50,150
Me, too!

23
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:58,358
This feels good!

24
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,228
Let it out, Kenji!

25
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,604
I want you to let a LOT out!

26
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:14,843
Come!

27
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,003
Come!

28
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:19,913
I'm-I'm gonna come!

29
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,754
Fuyuka works at an office in the city...

30
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:30,355
...she told me she'd heard some
unsavory rumors about the Swallowtail...

31
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:32,753
that as a secret service...

32
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:36,193
The mistress of the inn was
entertaining guests in a risqué manner...

33
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:43,865
I'm going to put it in...

34
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,216
Fuyuka...

35
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:08,228
How's that?

36
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:09,899
You like that, don't you?

37
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,198
Yes, I like it very much.

38
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:13,231
Really?

39
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:13,962
Yes...

40
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,700
Those gyrations right there...

41
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:19,467
I've never experienced
anything like this before...

42
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,344
And you can't beat the visual effects...

43
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:29,013
I'm going to come again!

44
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:30,480
Come!

45
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:32,554
Come as hard as you can!

46
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:34,546
Spray it all over me!

47
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:44,399
How was that?

48
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:50,330
I'm sorry, I jumped to conclusions.

49
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,937
I was sure it was part
of the rumor I heard...

50
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,270
Oh no, that wasn't...

51
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:56,746
By the way, where did you
learn that technique of yours?

52
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:59,042
Well, I'm going to have
to say "no comment"!

53
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:04,547
Fuyuka, you know I'm happy
to have you back here.

54
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:07,082
But I can handle the
entertaining on my own.

55
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:08,449
Why do you say that?

56
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:11,093
If we do it together we'll
make twice as much money.

57
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:13,026
And if word gets out that there's a
pair of gorgeous sisters entertaining...

58
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,722
...they'll be beating down our door!

59
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:15,728
Fuyuka!

60
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:16,355
What?

61
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,497
Entertainment is not
just about the sexual act.

62
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:23,202
You're never going to get anywhere
unless you can provide your customers...

63
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:24,831
...with a high level of expertise.

64
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:28,801
I'll be just fine, thank you!

65
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,211
I'd never met you before until today,
but you didn't have a problem, did you?

66
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,412
I made you feel good, didn't I?

67
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:36,383
Well, as a matter of...

68
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,348
but still!

69
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:39,682
So I don't see why I
can't handle it too!

70
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,620
Fuyuka!

71
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:44,389
You have no idea what I've
gone through until now...

72
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,497
Excuse me, sorry to bother
you at this late hour, but...

73
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,726
when you get the chance, could you
please bring a cucumber to my room?

74
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:56,003
Yes, of course, we'll take
care of that in a moment.

75
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,369
I'm on the first floor, at the very end.

76
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:04,170
Then I guess I'll make the delivery.

77
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,142
Fuyuka doesn't have a clue.

78
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:13,113
Perhaps I can't blame her for that...

79
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:16,856
But I can't let her getaway with
taking the entertainment lightly.

80
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:21,521
That's why I decided to let her
getsome first-hand experience.

81
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:29,004
So this is the madam's younger sister?

82
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,772
These sisters arejust
as beautiful as we heard!

83
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,035
And she's so young.

84
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,340
Her skin's as tightas
these sashimi pieces!

85
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:39,045
All right, then, we
should give her a try...

86
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,384
Hey, you're not supposed to move!

87
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,816
S-Sorry...

88
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:45,043
And no talking!

89
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:29,525
W-What  are you doing?

90
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:30,960
Shut up and lie still!

91
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:36,932
Stop it, no!

92
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,337
Stop it, please!

93
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:39,836
No!

94
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,806
No!

95
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:44,405
I can't do this!

96
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,609
What the hell is this?

97
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,118
She's got no manners!

98
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,749
This is no good! No good at all!

99
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,287
Please forgive me.

100
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,423
Let me take over from here...

101
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,735
Well, if you say so, Madam.

102
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,304
I guess we have no choice...

103
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,770
Let's start over from the beginning.

104
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:15,011
I'm so ashamed! I couldn't do it!

105
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:17,242
Now do you understand what
I was trying to tell you?

106
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:20,544
She's enduring what
they're doing to her...

107
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,750
Yuriko is so determined to
save the Swallowtail Inn that...

108
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,518
...she's willing to
risk her life, you see.

109
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:33,262
That's right...

110
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,257
I see what you mean, my
sister's such a strong person!

111
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:41,895
Forgive me if you found me lacking.

112
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:45,904
No, you really showed us a
good time. Here, take this...

113
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:54,581
Your patronage is appreciated...

114
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,351
Great view!

115
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,869
Perhaps I had been pushing myself...

116
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:17,536
...but even so, I should've
been able to take it...

117
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,137
While I was bedridden...

118
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:26,441
...Fuyuka made the decision to
undergo some entertainment training.

119
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,511
I've got to start entertaining,
we don't have much time!

120
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:31,313
Huh?

121
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:32,914
I know all about it.

122
00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:35,958
Even if we get the outdoor hotspring
fixed, we'll still be losing money.

123
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,152
You don't know when the Sasame-Yuki
dish will be back on the menu, do you?

124
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:43,262
Sasame-Yuki...

125
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,000
Listen up!

126
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:48,000
You know what Sasame-Yuki is?

127
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:51,832
I got the inspiration for this
entreé from a woman's body...

128
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:54,235
As long as you've got this on the menu...

129
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,335
...you're guaranteed to
be deluged with guests.

130
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:58,806
I want you to learn how to make this...

131
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:03,015
Also, never forget the
spirit of hospitality!

132
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:05,516
The spirit of hospitality...

133
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,550
If we don't do something,
there won't be any future...

134
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:11,520
...for the Swallowtail Inn, will there?

135
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,605
More!

136
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:29,775
More!

137
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,538
More!

138
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,219
I'm gonna come!

139
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,952
I can't hold it anymore...

140
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm coming!

141
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:52,096
Now I know what it is
you have to overcome...

142
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:07,482
And so began a series of harsh
training sessions for Fuyuka...

143
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:13,990
All right, straddle this rope.

144
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:14,948
Huh?

145
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:16,090
You mean this?

146
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:20,960
Now go ahead and walk!

147
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:22,524
Okay.

148
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:26,895
Don't say a word!

149
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,011
It's chafing me!

150
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:37,773
It's making me all hot down there...

151
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,484
It's hitting my spot!

152
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:47,288
Feels so good!

153
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:55,364
That's it, that's exactly
what's wrong with you, Fuyuka!

154
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:58,291
Why do you always try
to only come yourself?

155
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,904
There's no spirit of hospitality
in that kind of thinking!

156
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,333
Spirit of hospitality?

157
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:07,140
You're supposed to be
entertaining guests!

158
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,208
But look at you, you're
only enjoying yourself!

159
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,917
That's the reason why you failed
the first time you entertained!

160
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:19,646
I don't want someone like you to be
concerned with the future of this inn!

161
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,619
No! I always finish what I started!
I'm not going to sit around...

162
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,159
...and let my sister
do all the suffering!

163
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,430
Stop concentrating on that one area!

164
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:41,709
I could feel Fuyuka's pain
myself, right in my own groin...

165
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,749
That's good...

166
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:53,953
Feels good scraping against the bumps...

167
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:03,288
I'm gonna come...

168
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,367
I'm gonna come...

169
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:07,398
I'm going to...

170
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,400
I can't hold itany longer!

171
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,280
Are you really going to
fix the outdoor hotspring?

172
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:31,827
Yes, we're going to start the repairs,
it'll be ready in time for winter.

173
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:33,895
Wow, I can't wait!

174
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:35,756
Kenji...

175
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:37,557
Kenji?

176
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,531
Oh, I'm so sorry...

177
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:41,502
Are you all right?

178
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,869
Once in a while I completely space out.

179
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:49,169
I wonder if that means
my memory's coming back...

180
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,446
Kenji will be going
someplace far from here...

181
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:57,987
I know that it's only to be
expected, once he regains his memory...

182
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,849
Ow! It's too strong!

183
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:05,852
S-Stop it!

184
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,394
You still don't understand, do you?

185
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:11,430
That hand shows exactly
what you're feeling inside...

186
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:12,728
You're rejecting your customers!

187
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,002
That's not true!

188
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,338
Do you think your customers will enjoy
themselves if you that's your attitude?

189
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:25,345
There'sjust no way in hell!

190
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:27,984
<i> </i>
You must know the spirit of hospitality...

191
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:30,387
Not my nipples!

00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,013
No, stop it!

195
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:50,537
You need to be more flexible!
Otherwise you can't entertain!

196
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,540
Ouch!

197
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:56,939
Ow! That hurts!

198
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,039
Spirit of hospitality!

199
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:00,979
Oh, come on...

200
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:11,685
We have to do something to
correct your fidgeting, Fuyuka...

201
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:14,222
It's hot!

202
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:16,395
No!

203
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:21,030
No, I can't do this!

204
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,834
No, you must endure this some more,
and let me come now, like this.

205
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:37,544
Please don't make me do this anymore...

206
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:39,485
The spirit of hospitality, Fuyuka!

207
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,351
S-Spirit of hospitality...

208
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:49,763
Spirit of hospitality...

209
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,058

Spirit of hospitality...

215
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:18,421
In order to see if the training helped,
Fuyuka was subjected to one final test...

216
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:22,320
That's it, Fuyuka! Just keep that up!

217
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,601
Come on, Fuyuka!

218
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:44,752
Just a little farther, you can do it!

219
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,131
You did it!

220
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:03,301
You did it!

221
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:05,431
You did a goodjob, Fuyuka!

222
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:13,374
Fuyuka!

223
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,147
Kenji...

224
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:23,556
Fuyuka, you passed the test.

225
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:24,557
Really?

226
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:26,556
Congratulations, Fuyuka!

227
00:17:26,863 --> 00:17:29,889
I'll do even better
during the real thing!

228
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:41,070
This is how Sasame-Yuki should look.
Take a good look and don't forget it!

229
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:42,241
Yes, sir.

230
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:44,107
Sasame-Yuki...

231
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:48,050
It can't be, there's no way...

232
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:32,454
You did it!

233
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,665
Go for it!

234
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:40,030
Go for it!

235
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:41,501
Go for it!

236
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:42,935
Go for it!

237
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,540
She is notgoing to
run away like last time.

238
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:50,169
Please rest assured
and enjoy yourselves.

239
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:55,312
Let's get some fresh sauce on
her while she's still fresh!

240
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:07,126
This is great!

241
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,528
Gotta love the way it's mixed
up with all this sweat, too!

242
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:10,988
Lemme see...

243
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,520
All right then, this one's for you!

244
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,018
Let that cup runneth over, eh?

245
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:44,626
Thank you so much!

246
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,503
You know what Sasame-Yuki is?

247
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,502
I got the inspiration for this
entreé from a woman's body...

248
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,773
The road to sex leads
to the road of cuisine...

249
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:04,686
After all, we can't live
without either of them...

250
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:08,548
And then there's the
spirit of hospitality...

251
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:11,218
Don't ever forget the
spirit of hospitality...

252
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:16,294
This is the ultimate representation
of the Sasame-Yuki entrée

253
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,832
I was trained to make...

254
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:20,126
It's done.

255
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:23,594
It's delicious!

256
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:27,531
This is what had a long time ago!

257
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:29,674
This is it! It's Sasame-Yuki!

258
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,738
Kenji!

259
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:36,551
Well done!

260
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:38,717
If you were able to accomplish that...

261
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,755
...that means you must be on the
brink of regaining your memory!

262
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,688
Kenji...

263
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,684
Excuse me, but who are you?

264
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:48,658
Let me introduce myself to you all...

265
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:51,062
My name is Hibari Akisawa.

266
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:55,298
This is the Head Chef of the
Japanese Cuisine Department...

267
00:20:55,405 --> 00:21:00,138
...of my father's hotel chain,
the Akisawa Tourism Group.

268
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,776
He's also my fiancé, Kenji Minasagi...

269
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:06,742
Fiancé?

270
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,850
Akisawa Tourism Group?

271
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:12,517
You mean the resort developer giant?

272
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:13,450
That's right!

273
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,083
Well? Are you starting
to remember, Kenji?

274
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:26,124
Then do you know why
everyone here calls you Kenji?

275
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:30,400
You used to train under the
former proprietor of this inn.

276
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,634
The master's name was also
Kenji, isn't that right?

277
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:37,244
Why, yes...

278
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,845
The mistress gave you the same
name as her husband, you see?

279
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,584
Try to remember now, Kenji!

280
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:45,345
Kenji...

281
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:48,022
My name is Kenji Minasagi...

282
00:21:48,257 --> 00:21:49,019
Kenji...

283
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,060
My master's name was Kenji Shiratori...

284
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,594
My master's signature
dish was Sasame-Yuki...

285
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:59,296
My master's inn was
named the Swallowtail Inn...

286
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,070
<i> </i>
Letter of Resignation

287
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,503
You can't be serious!
Letter of Resignation

288
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,802
My master's inn is in trouble!

289
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:06,499
I'm going to go there and get
it back on track, no matter what!

290
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:10,308
But you've been chosen to take over
the Akisawa Group after my father!

291
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,903
You're not just going to
throw that away, are you?

292
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,612
That's right.

293
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:17,384
I decided to give up everything, and
made my way to the Swallowtail Inn...

294
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:49,351
The doctors told me
I shouldn't push you...

295
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:54,251
That I shouldn't try to make
you remember everything at once.

296
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:57,718
So I came here as a
guest to wait and see...

297
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:04,462
There's a place that
you have to go back to...

298
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:08,396
Please, come back with me...

299
00:23:14,577 --> 00:23:15,771
I missed this!

300
00:23:17,246 --> 00:23:18,873
I missed everything about you!

301
00:23:21,918 --> 00:23:26,150
I don't want to have to use a
cucumber to comfort myself anymore...

302
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:29,015
I want you to churn!

303
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:32,159
You're hitting my spot!

304
00:23:33,596 --> 00:23:34,255
Yes!

305
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:35,421
Yes!

306
00:23:35,698 --> 00:23:37,461
Better than a cucumber!

307
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:41,236
Please faster!

308
00:23:42,238 --> 00:23:42,795
Faster!

309
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,270
I'm gonna come right now!

310
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,243
Kenji regained his memory in full.

311
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:05,321
So you're leaving tomorrow, aren't you?

312
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:09,120
It seems like it's all
been a dream, you know...

313
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:13,090
Yuriko...

314
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:48,998
Yuriko, I'll never forget
you as long as I live...

315
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:53,903
Now that I've perfected Sasame-Yuki,
you have nothing to worry about.

316
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,705
The Swallowtail Inn will be
just fine with you and Fuyuka...

317
00:24:57,546 --> 00:25:00,640
Kenji, thank you from
the bottom of my heart...

318
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,680
I just don't know how to thank you!

319
00:25:03,986 --> 00:25:06,955
I'll see to it that the
Swallowtail Inn thrives!

320
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,051
It was a bit of a shock to
learn that Kenji had a fiancé...

321
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:14,462
But I guess I shouldn't be
surprised, a man like that!

322
00:25:14,797 --> 00:25:16,424
I'll do my best as an entertainer...

323
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:30,104
I can't believe how well
I've been feeling lately!

324
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:35,243
It's because Kenji made love to me, and
I gota taste of that Sasame-Yuki dish...

325
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:39,920
I owe my life to Kenji.

326
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:41,412
Thank you so much!

327
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:46,656
K-Kenji...

328
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,532
I'm going to come!

329
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:00,700
I'm going to come!

330
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:04,210
Kenji, I'm going to come!

331
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:07,976
I'm going to come!

332
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:12,715
I-Is it all right if I come now?

333
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:15,285
Is it all right if I come now?

334
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,319
I-I'm going to come now, too...

335
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,090
I want you to come, Kenji!

336
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:24,858
Let it all out!

337
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:27,434
I'm coming!

338
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,800
I'm coming now!

339
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:30,871
Yuriko!

340
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:00,468
And so Kenji returned
to where he belonged.

341
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,439
For us, he left behind a
newly reborn Swallowtail Inn...

342
00:27:12,014 --> 00:27:14,346
Spring time has come again.

343
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,479
The season I met Kenji
for the first time...

344
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:20,180
And...

345
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:23,891
One Sasame-Yuki! It's ready!

346
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:26,761
All right! I'm coming!

347
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:31,995
The Swallowtail Inn was acquired
by the Akisawa Tourism Group...

348
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:37,629
and Kenji took over as the
Swallowtail's manager and Head Chef...

349
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:47,344
Just as they say, all's
well that ends well...

350
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:53,612
I really am a blessed woman...
