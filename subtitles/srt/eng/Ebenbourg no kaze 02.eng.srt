1
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:15,293
Promise?

2
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:17,296
I promise.

3
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:18,353
Really?

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,956
I'll promise I will!

5
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:31,174
Wind of Ebenbourg

6
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:35,576
Chapter 2:
The Sea of Treason & Jealousy

7
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,592
I know I was dreaming.

8
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,528
But I can't remember it.

9
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:03,939
Mylene, Mylene!
Why didn't you wake me up?

10
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,746
I'm finally here.

11
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:36,564
Found it!

12
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,022
It looks like he is doing well
as the new Lord of Ronsard.

13
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:00,399
Lord Claude Flavini.

14
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,259
Yes, Grandmother.

15
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:05,768
He is trying to revive the land
that was dilapidated...

16
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,032
by the previous lord, Lord Eric.

17
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:13,876
His efforts to strengthen military forces
through heavy taxing and forced labor.

18
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:22,650
Eric was not a bad lord at all.

19
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:27,949
He worried about this country's future
in his own way...

20
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:31,486
and strengthened the military
and weapons industry.

21
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:35,033
You can say that he tried too hard.

22
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:37,429
But with that military power...

23
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:41,132
he attempted to take over Ebenbourg
with a coup d'etat.

24
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:46,611
Since you caught wind of his plans
beforehand and reported it to the Duke...

25
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:50,342
Ebenbourg is peaceful today.
So thank you, my dear.

26
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,184
How long will that last, Grandmother?

27
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:54,218
You're right.

28
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:56,949
Ebenbourg's state of affairs
with the other kingdoms...

29
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,115
isn't anything to laugh about.

30
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:02,691
Tourism and trade, the establishment
of this country...

31
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:05,263
as a center of commerce
is the key to protecting...

32
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:08,163
the development and independence
of this country.

33
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,465
That is his intentions, Grandmother.

34
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:18,233
Standing around like that,
he looks exactly like his late father, Bernard.

35
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,412
Lord Eric, Lord Eric.

36
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:31,123
Mylene, over here.

37
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:33,549
Did you bring it?

38
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:39,498
You did well in finding this.

39
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,625
So you slept with him for it?

40
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,562
There is no need to do that with him.

41
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:51,442
It seems that he doesn't like
to suspect people.

42
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:56,777
He shows me all the documents
and budget for restoration plan...

43
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:01,354
without regard and even asks
for my opinion.

44
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:02,510
He's a failure.

45
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,690
As a lord.

46
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:21,063
Since Lord Claude has come,
whenever I go out to buy food...

47
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:25,601
there are so many people out,
you'd think that the population has risen.

48
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:30,549
Construction and cultivation.
The work load has increased...

49
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:34,713
and the people must be tired,
yet their expressions are so alive.

50
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,845
Forget it. He's a swindler.

51
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:40,216
They're all being fooled by his façade.

52
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:44,028
It's just a game. That's not real politics.

53
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:45,494
Know what this is?

54
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:49,962
It's a memorandum I sent
to the Empire of Germany.

55
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,807
When I conquer Ebenbourg,
the Empire will sign...

56
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:57,570
this non-aggression treaty
and become an ally.

57
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:01,205
I will have secured the future and safety
of the people of Ebenbourg.

58
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:02,871
That is politics!

59
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:06,108
The Lord is a solitary position, my dear.

60
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:08,520
Lord Eric!

61
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:15,789
No, don't.

62
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:18,022
Please stop it.

63
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,792
No, Lord Eric!

64
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:23,334
Keep going, keep going.

65
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:25,470
I can't!

66
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:30,666
Call me Master! Women like situations
like this, you know?

67
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:35,706
Please stop it, Lord Eric, no!

68
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:37,142
It hurts.

69
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,462
It hurts!

70
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:55,696
Lord Eric.

71
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,967
Call me Master! Master, I say!

72
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,437
Master!

73
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:08,173
No, please!

74
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:11,477
No, I can't. Please don't, no!

75
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:13,846
Doesn't this bring back memories?

76
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:17,514
Back then, when you were full
of desire and passion!

77
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,247
It was incredible.

78
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:44,841
You like it.

79
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:59,188
This is really steep.

80
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:00,933
Better watch my step.

81
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,211
Lord Claude Flavini? Is it you?

82
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:17,315
Yes. Nice to meet you.

83
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:23,113
We've met before.
You probably already forgot.

84
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,557
Are you...

85
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:27,725
Yes?

86
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:31,459
Are you going home already?

87
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:36,432
Yes. I was thinking it's about time
to go to the sewer maintenance assembly...

88
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:38,127
that's being held tonight by the people.

89
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:39,000
Tonight?

90
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:40,328
No, wait!

91
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:42,665
It's lunch time.

92
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:47,070
And here I worked so hard to make you
such a splendid lunch, Lord Claude.

93
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,205
Isn't it?

94
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:54,078
You made this all by yourself?
Just for me?

95
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:57,283
By the way, who are you?

96
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:02,519
Charlotte Verlaine.

97
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:07,493
Under the orders of Mistress Sophie,
I have become a maid for Ronsard Manor.

98
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:12,202
I remember Sophie saying something
about hiring another maid...

99
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:16,741
because Mylene can't handle
the entire mansion by herself.

100
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,783
Starting to feel good, aren't you?

101
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:29,083
Your body can't live without me any more.

102
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:32,954
Stop, it hurts!

103
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,593
No, not yet.

104
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:53,541
No, it hurts!

105
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,872
You sure? You really want me to stop?

106
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,819
Don't stop.

107
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:03,812
You telling me what to do?

108
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:09,393
Then, clean my dick,
covered with your blood.

109
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:11,725
Stick it in your mouth. Come on.

110
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:26,738
All right then, get up.
Turn around and stick your ass out.

111
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,448
No more. Please stop it.

112
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:53,836
No, please stop it.
I can't take it anymore.

113
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:05,147
It hurts!

114
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:06,411
It's a good hurt.

115
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,527
I can't take it!

116
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:58,502
We're just getting going.

117
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,538
No more, please!

118
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:37,674
Mylene, it's not quite over, yet.

119
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:53,547
Good.

120
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:27,158
You like it? It's freshly boiled chicken.

121
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:40,605
The boiled chicken, I thought I put it
somewhere around here.

122
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,776
Lately foods have been
disappearing. So strange.

123
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:46,401
What's wrong, Charlotte?

124
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:51,049
Lord Claude!
I'll prepare your meal right away!

125
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:54,575
It's okay, I have to go
oversee the bridge.

126
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:58,312
The Duke of Ebenbourg is coming
to inspect, so I need to prepare.

127
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:01,723
By the way, have you seen Mylene?
I don't know where she is.

128
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:03,427
Now that you mention it...

129
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:07,626
she was setting the silverware over there.
I wonder where she went.

130
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:11,126
It's okay, I'll look for her.

131
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:14,629
Yesterday's lunch was delicious.

132
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:16,808
I'm looking forward to today's meal.

133
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:18,575
Yes!

134
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:20,344
You can use the carriage today.

135
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:21,702
Okay.

136
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,482
I guess there's no way
he remembers anything...

137
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:30,688
about this town,
or those promises he made back then.

138
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:34,017
Plus, our social status is so different.

139
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:44,295
I'm sorry. This mansion
doesn't allow for me to have pets.

140
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:08,182
Come in.

141
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:14,656
Excuse me.
You were looking for me?

142
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:17,465
I thought I put the design for the bridge...

143
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,935
around here, but I can't find it.

144
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:20,394
Have you seen it?

145
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:22,397
No sir, I haven't.

146
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:26,772
Lord Claude,
I will look for it and bring it to you.

147
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,880
You must leave soon.

148
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:31,683
That's right.

149
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:33,284
Then, could you?

150
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,617
Charlotte is going to bring my lunch,
so you can hand it to her?

151
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:41,090
As you wish.

152
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,631
Come to think of it, Mylene,
your birthday is coming up, isn't it?

153
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:51,226
My birthday is next month.

154
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:57,573
It may be a bit early...

155
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,574
but you've been working so hard
since I came.

156
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,445
So I prepared a present
for you over there.

157
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:09,718
I'm just a maid, I cannot take it!

158
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,024
I need you to take it.

159
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,250
They're perishable.

160
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,656
I'll see you later!

161
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:28,029
Lord Claude.

162
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:32,437
Lord Eric, what should I do?

163
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:39,274
That's enough for today,
you can go home now.

164
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,442
Promise?

165
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:06,904
I promise.

166
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:11,973
I promise I will.

167
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:16,082
Lord Claude.

168
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,318
Charlotte?

169
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:29,267
It looks like I fell asleep.

170
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:33,704
Do you still have time
before the Duke arrives?

171
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:35,707
Yes, I do.

172
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:36,964
Thank goodness.

173
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:42,513
Were you having
a pleasant dream, if I may ask?

174
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:43,837
Why's that?

175
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:47,919
You looked so peaceful
in your sleep.

176
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:49,582
A dream?

177
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,652
I finally remembered my past.

178
00:16:55,361 --> 00:17:01,698
A promise I made here long ago
with someone I loved.

179
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:05,428
To get married the next time we meet.

180
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:09,805
You remembered it. I'm so happy.

181
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:12,307
Charlotte, I didn't recognize you.

182
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:14,812
You've become so lovely.

183
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:17,939
You too, have become so magnificent.

184
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,813
You there! What are you doing?

185
00:17:56,122 --> 00:18:00,058
What are you doing?
This is Ronsard. My land.

186
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,852
We are the Guards of the Duke Ebenbourg.

187
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:06,628
We have come to check the route
the Duke will take ahead of time.

188
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:11,136
And we have found and removed
an explosive from the girder of the bridge!

189
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:15,139
You can't be too careful,
the Duke has had many death threats.

190
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:20,608
An explosive was planted?

191
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,171
What are you...

192
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:27,442
It's almost time.

193
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:34,449
Now all I have to do is wait
for the Duke's arrival.

194
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,339
We will be entering the territory
of Ronsard shortly.

195
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:53,639
I hear the new Lord
is a noble young man.

196
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:54,835
Yes.

197
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:10,956
Unhand him, he is not a villain!

198
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:12,862
Mistress Rosalie!

199
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:14,932
It still is dangerous.

200
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:18,336
Lieutenant, this man is Claude McDonald.

201
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:23,438
He has saved my life once before.
And will become my groom!

202
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:26,270
It has already been decided.

203
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,008
Well, that's not...

204
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:30,705
Lord Claude!

205
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:35,143
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

206
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:38,256
Charlotte, what's going on?

207
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:41,049
The bomb under the girder is a dummy!

208
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:43,252
The real one is somewhere else!

209
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:44,327
What did you say?

210
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:45,686
Lmpossible!

211
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:51,028
Something's going on.

212
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:57,208
Please, stop this nonsense, Lord Eric!

213
00:19:57,743 --> 00:19:59,267
Mylene!

214
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,437
The Duke is here!

215
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:06,279
He's here!

216
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:09,711
Let's run away together!

217
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:13,416
Lord Eric, I love you.

218
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:15,015
Mylene.

219
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:25,126
I'll go warn them!

220
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:27,561
Charlotte!

221
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:32,573
Charlotte, keep them going!

222
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:33,800
Yes!

223
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:43,989
Claude!

224
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,679
It's too late!

225
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:03,598
Keep going straight ahead!

226
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:21,351
Lord Claude.

227
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:26,364
So you are the new Lord of Ronsard.
Pleased to meet you.

228
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:31,364
Please save the introductions.

229
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,211
Milord! Is everyone all right!

230
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:44,345
We made it!

231
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:48,176
All right!

232
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:02,523
This is the memorandum from Germany!

233
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:10,873
Tell that swindler to use this and develop
good international relations.

234
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:14,612
He can make it fall into place.

235
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,307
I'm going to America.

236
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:21,278
I'm going to start again in a new land.

237
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:23,879
Lord Eric.

238
00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:32,494
Lord Eric, I'm coming with you!

239
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,924
Call me Master.

240
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:26,582
It's my first time, I'm scared.

241
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:28,849
There's no need be.

242
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:53,798
Charlotte, Here I go.
Are you ready?

243
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:55,906
I'm ready, Lord Claude!

244
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:05,981
Are you okay?

245
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,503
Death will come to traitors.
