1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:07,830
Magical Twilight 3

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,560
Minori!

3
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,100
How many times do I have to tell you?!
I won't let you run off?

4
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,450
You're just a child!

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,540
I'm an adult! I can take care of myself.

6
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,760
I'm going to be a singer.

7
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,630
Thousands of girls show
up at those casting calls.

8
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,240
Young girls are disposable.

9
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,710
How can I let you go to a place like that?
You're my baby.

10
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,010
You don't really think
I'm important do you?

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,450
You don't think about anything
but this stupid hotel.

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,530
You only care about what other people
think about you, not about me.

13
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,340
Excuse me...

14
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,870
When will breakfest be ready?

15
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,940
Oh yes, it will be ready immediately.

16
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,410
Minori.

17
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,580
Who the hell does she think she is?
I hate my mother.

18
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,080
It's wet...

19
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,480
So wet..

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,500
Ah! Feel so good.

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,830
I'm getting wetter and wetter.

22
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,900
Oh, I'm coming!

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,150
If he's here...

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,510
Please.

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,290
Oh, thank you.

26
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,780
What's the matter?

27
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,770
What? Oh, nothing.

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,570
Hey, those hot spring are making it
impossible for me to ground myself.

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,330
And our plan of sneaking off alone
has been ruined. Let's go home.

30
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,420
No way! Remember what
we did to the bullet train?

31
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,470
We've got to wait a while.

32
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,290
So tell me, how I can keep myself
occupied way out here in the country?

33
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,400
There's a fireworks festival today in the
village at the root of the mountain.

34
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,450
What? In this season?

35
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,710
Yes, out here in the middle of nowhere
almost anything can happen.

36
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,760
By the way, where's Irene?

37
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,640
Your companion's been with a young
gentleman who's also staying here.

38
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,290
She was right!

39
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,740
Hey, Irene!

40
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,830
Hey, let's play UFO Catcher next.

41
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,500
Where in the hell have you been?
We were worried about you.

42
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,380
Hey you! Where do you get off
talking to her like that?

43
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,850
Who are you?

44
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,910
My sweet-heart.

45
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,950
Don't act ignorant, you bastard!
I challenge you to a duel!

46
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,960
What the hell?

47
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,800
Hey, just why do I have to fight you?

48
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,940
Look in your heart for the answer!

49
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,950
Wow! You did it! You did it!

50
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,740
I don't know what's going on here, but I'm a man
and a man has to accept an invitation to fight.

51
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,840
I used to be a member
of the ping pong club!

52
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,480
Shut your mouth and do it!

53
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,090
Okay, there!

54
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,440
I can't stop helping him.

55
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,200
Hey, come on!

56
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,160
Here's my Hurricane Smash!

57
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,070
Watch out!

58
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,630
Revenge of the Hurricane!

59
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,520
Shining Smash!

60
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,010
Galactic Attack!

61
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,220
Genocide Sonic!

62
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:47,940
Best Thunder!

63
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,670
Buring Attack!

64
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,370
Burning Blast!

65
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:49,890
Atomic Smash!

66
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,820
Sonic Boom!

67
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,980
Thunder Pulse!

68
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,390
Burnig Attack!

69
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,590
So how long have you been
so friendly with this guy?

70
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,590
I hope you didn't use magic.

71
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,970
I did.

72
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,380
Uh, you're pretty good at ping pong.

73
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,940
I'm not finished yet!

74
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,340
It's a horrible violation of the rules to
manipulate minds during our practical exams.

75
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,220
You ditz! If I tried something like that.

76
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,950
I would have my ass
extradited in a second.

77
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,730
The charm I used was this nice body.

78
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,830
Of course, if you'll promise
not to tell anybody...

79
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,020
...it would have been a cinch using
"Pon Far" mind manipulation magic.

80
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,920
To manipulate the mind of
others serves no purpose!

81
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,600
The reason we're doing our exams together
is so we can keep an eye on each other.

82
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,070
I won't let you sneak in any magic!

83
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,460
Who do you think you are?

84
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,480
Well, if you break the rules,
I won't forgive you either!

85
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,150
I don't break the rules.

86
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,230
Never!

87
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,000
Oops.

88
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,310
Are you all right, Tsukasa-kun?

89
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,740
I'm fine. This happen all the time.

90
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,200
What a cute pair of watches!

91
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,350
Why don't we buy these?

92
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,210
What's the matter? Don't you like them?

93
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:06,560
Yes I do. Chipple, this is the first time
I've seen you so happy on this trip.

94
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,870
I'm glad.

95
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,080
Hey!

96
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,650
What?

97
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,740
I will buy these watches
and give them to you.

98
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,170
No, no! I'll buy them for you!

99
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,140
Don't worry about it!

100
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,990
I'm enjoying this trip
because you're with me.

101
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,170
I'll buy them. Wait a second.

102
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,620
Pardon me...

103
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,550
Excuse me...

104
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,390
You're...

105
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,350
Can I talk with you for a moment?

106
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,390
Talk to me?

107
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,100
Excuse me... oh, no.

108
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,400
Please.

109
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,120
Have sex with me.

110
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,850
My mother treats me like a little kid.

111
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,450
She wants to keep me locked up
in these boring mountains!

112
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,950
I want to prove to her that I'm an adult
who's capable of taking care of myself!

113
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,950
Please, fuck me!

114
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,940
Free me from my mother.

115
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,910
Wait!

116
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,960
Chipple!

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,410
How come it's Tsukasa-kun
you want to have sex with?

118
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,470
Because...

119
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,900
I don't want to have my first sexual
experience with an unskilled person.

120
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,380
Just what do you mean?

121
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,340
This person and my mother
were together last night.

122
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,020
They were doing it.

123
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,810
Say what?

124
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,360
Tsukasa-kun, tell me this is a lie.

125
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,340
It's not like it was an affair
or an intentional betrayal.

126
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,270
I, uh, just couldn't help...

127
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,580
You couldn't help what?!

128
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,330
Last night I was sick because
of that damn hot spring!

129
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,250
I can't believe you did such
a thing when I was sick!

130
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,060
Minori-san, I'll solve
your problem for you!

131
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,390
You want to escape from
your mother, right?

132
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,850
I'll make your dream come
true with a little magic!

133
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,450
Don't do that!

134
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,660
You can't just manipulate people's
minds by using magic!

135
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,950
You can't just use magic
indiscriminately!

136
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,290
I'm a witch.

137
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,150
Chipple.

138
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,880
No! Don't!

139
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,010
Don't do it, Chipple!

140
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,670
I never meant to get Chipple so upset.

141
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,860
Why do things like this
always happen to me?

142
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,170
How about a human skeleton?

143
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,120
I couldn't find anything except this.

144
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,930
I guess it's okay.

145
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,770
Excuse me, but are you really a witch?

146
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,650
You'll be able to leave here and move to Tokyo
with a clear conscience if you do this now.

147
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,530
It will sever the relationship
between you and your mother.

148
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,300
Are you ready?

149
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,970
Akaira Dohcapi Jiafula Tarde

150
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,940
Akaira Dohcapi Jiafula Tarde

151
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,540
Akaira Dohcapi Jiafula Tarde

152
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,550
Akaira Dohcapi Jiafula Tarde

153
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
That energy wave...

154
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,050
Pon Far!

155
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,570
No! Chipple!

156
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,060
What in the hell?

157
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,020
I manipulated their memories.

158
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,080
I've made it so that Ayako-san and
Minori-san no longer know they're related.

159
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,550
and I've set up some nasty barriers between them.

160
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,880
No way!

161
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,330
You've got no right to do that!

162
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,340
She asked for it.

163
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,090
I can't believe you'd actually
mess with people's minds!

164
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,490
Did you do it to me, too?

165
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,060
Oh, no!

166
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,650
Chipple!

167
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,670
Even though I'm on your side, I can't
ignore what's going on!

168
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,370
Irene!

169
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,130
Anyone who breaks the exam's rules
must be sent back home and

170
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,750
all memories of her have to be erased
from anyone she's been involved with.

171
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,300
You do know that, don't you?

172
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:55,960
Wait!

173
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,970
Oh, what did you do to me?

174
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,690
I'll erase you from Tsukasa's memory.

175
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,320
Nooooo!

176
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,610
I can't help it.

177
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,380
I don't want to do this, but a witch has
to obey the rules of the magical world.

178
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,820
Please... don't!

179
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,530
Tsukasa-kun.

180
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,570
Tsukasa-kun.

181
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,970
Tsukasa-kun.

182
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,080
Who

183
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,690
are you?

184
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,680
Oh, wait!

185
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,870
Chipple...

186
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,150
To Tsukasa, love Chipple.

187
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,080
What's the matter?

188
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,190
Oh, hello.

189
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,810
What are you doing here alone?

190
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,890
I feel starnge, like I'm
missing something.

191
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,690
Me, too

192
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:41,830
I can't forget about last night.
Please say my name again.

193
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,670
Wait a second. I thought that
was the first and last time.

194
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,220
I crave companionship
when I start feeling lonely.

195
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,000
You have Minori-san.

196
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,680
What are you talking about?

197
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,990
She is not related to me at all.

198
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,750
What the hell?

199
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,310
That was strange. Why did
she say something like that?

200
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,160
Minori-chan?

201
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,180
Minori-chan!!

202
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,010
Why did you try to do such a stupid thing?
What's the matter with you?

203
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,450
I had an argument with that woman.

204
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,200
You mean the Landlady?

205
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,340
Even though we are not biologically related,
I thought we were doing fine until now.

206
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,890
But suddenly, I've lost my patience with
her because of some tiny little thing.

207
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,690
When I noticed it, it felt like
I'd lost all reason for living.

208
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,220
I felt so lonely and helpless.

209
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,600
Wait a second. I thought you and she
were mother and daughter.

210
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,380
But now, for some reason,
both of you think you're unrelated.

211
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,440
I feel like I've forgotten
something very important.

212
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,630
But I can't figure out what it is.

213
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,160
Me, too. I feel like there's
a big hole in my heart.

214
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,030
I'm cold.

215
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,520
Minori-chan.

216
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,240
Please, please warm me up.

217
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,480
I'm so embarressed.
My breasts are so small.

218
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,260
No, not at all. You're very cute.

219
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,990
Can I touch you down there?

220
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,020
Tsukasa-kun, oh wow!

221
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,070
I'm going crazy.

222
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,650
No! I'm scared!

223
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,830
It's all right.

224
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,720
I'll do it gently.

225
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,850
There you go. You're
getting wetter and wetter.

226
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,500
No!

227
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,980
How about there?

228
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,920
Your pussy is so beautiful, Minori-chan.

229
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,200
No! Don't stare at it. I'm embarrassed.

230
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,590
Don't feel embarrassed. You
should accept yourself as you are.

231
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,130
Tsukasa-san, I want you. Come to me.

232
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,130
Oh, ouch!

233
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,120
Are you all right?

234
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,080
You'll feel wonderful too soon.

235
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,430
How do you feel?

236
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,520
It's strange. It hurts but it feel good.

237
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,250
Me too.

238
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,220
We'll be able to see the fireworks
better from over there.

239
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,400
I guess so.

240
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,940
I can't spend any more time with Seichi.
I've got things to do.

241
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,420
Is something wrong?

242
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,160
Oh, no. Not at all.

243
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,230
Really?

244
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,930
Seichi-kun, I've got something
very important to tell you.

245
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,780
What?

246
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,220
I've got to go back.

247
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,500
To Tokyo? That's okay, I'll go with you.

248
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,350
No.

249
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,390
I'm part of the crew of a spaceship
on a five year mission.

250
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,240
What was that?

251
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,800
Lieutenant Irene, return
to the ship immediately.

252
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,660
Roger!

253
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,970
It's been fun. I won't forget you.

254
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,670
Transporter room, transport!

255
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,510
Goodbye, Seichi.

256
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,910
Irene!

257
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,990
Irene, I won't be afraid
of women anymore!

258
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,510
Thank you for giving me courage.

259
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,580
I got away with it thanks to this watch.

260
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,680
That's...

261
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,530
Take this and give it to him.

262
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,970
No, it would be too painful
just to see his face.

263
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,420
If your relationship ends like this,
it will be more painful still.

264
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,190
Here!

265
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,550
Here!

266
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,440
Wait a second. How did you become
such a good person all of the sudden?

267
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,940
Good person?

268
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,940
When I get called a good person,
it's the end of the world.

269
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,490
Do your best!

270
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,740
Don't feel regret.

271
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,190
You mean don't do the
things you never do.

272
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,160
Really...

273
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,820
Excuse me.

274
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,970
I'd like to go in there.
Could you move a little?

275
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,230
No!

276
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,650
You don't recognize me do you?

277
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,888
Who is that woman?

278
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,510
Chipple!

279
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,150
Chipple!

280
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,580
Chipple!

281
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,600
Tsukasa-kun!

282
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,680
Planting a spell on that watch was brilliant!

283
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,171
Am I a genius or what?

284
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:06,780
But if I keep doing things like this I will
become a nice person.

285
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,150
That's not good!

286
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,030
Tsukasa-kun.

287
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:40,880
Chipple.

288
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,340
Let me do it.

289
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,250
Tsukasa-kun, you're inside me.

290
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,850
Tsukasa-kun! Tsukasa-kun!

291
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,890
Oh, God!

292
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,950
More, more!

293
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,750
Tsukasa-kun, no!

294
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,810
Tsukasa-kun, please hold me tight!

295
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,620
Don't leave me.

296
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,170
Chipple, Chipple you're so hot inside.

297
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,960
No, give it to me, hurry!

298
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,070
Tsukasa-kun!

299
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,620
Oh, no! I'm going crazy!

300
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,280
Don't torture me.

301
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,150
Hurry, don't make me wait any longer.

302
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,310
Hurry!

303
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,510
Coming! I'm coming!

304
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,270
Oh no, Tsukasa!

305
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,160
Coming! I'm coming!

306
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,910
I certainly understand why witches have to
come to Earth for these practical exams.

307
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,480
I have one thing that I understand too.

308
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,790
What?

309
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,960
Wheather she's a witch or something else,
I love this girl name Chipple.

310
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,790
Tsukasa-kun!
