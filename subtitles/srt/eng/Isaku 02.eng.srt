1
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:19,059
No!

2
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:28,304
Don't!

3
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,509
Stop!

4
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:40,011
Let me go!

5
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:43,514
No!

6
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:45,523
Stop!

7
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:50,957
Isaku, stop!

8
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:52,958
Please stop!

9
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,764
Munemitsu, where's Rika?

10
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:04,667
Where's Rika, let her go, damn it!

11
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:08,503
Munemitsu, why are you doing this?

12
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:10,779
Hey, Rika!

13
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:13,183
Your friend's calling you!

14
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:21,456
Rika!

15
00:01:22,162 --> 00:01:24,096
Rika, are you okay?

16
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:29,164
Rika!

17
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:47,878
Stop, help me!

18
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:51,319
No!

19
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,032
Isaku: Episode 2 "Kotomi"

20
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:54,586
Stop!

21
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:00,417
Don't!

22
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:03,529
Somebody!

23
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:07,259
Please stop!

24
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:10,158
Stop it!

25
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:16,865
Help me!

26
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:21,940
Help me!

27
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:31,280
Please!

28
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:34,961
Kenta, help!

29
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:39,191
What's wrong, Miyuki? You look upset.

30
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:41,595
I'm all right.

31
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:47,432
Really, I'm all right.

32
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,268
Just making sure.

33
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:58,651
The guys are really late.

34
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,583
That's true.

35
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:09,720
How was it, Jinpachi?

36
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:12,890
Were you able to find Mio?

37
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,724
I haven't found her yet.

38
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:20,601
I hope she's okay.

39
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,037
Kenta?

40
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:29,140
Where's Kenta?

41
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:34,487
Where's Kenta and Munemitsu?

42
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,182
We split up, so I don't know.

43
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:43,792
Let's go back to the music room.

44
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,093
This room reminds me...

45
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:50,097
of that stupid video, so let's leave!

46
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,477
Akemi....

47
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:00,206
Hold up, Akemi!

48
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:21,264
Akemi despises me so much.

49
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:22,563
That's why...

50
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:24,801
I don't think so, Ms. Kumi.

51
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,073
Let's hurry back to the music room.

52
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:47,716
Wait!

53
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,293
Where's Miyuki?

54
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:51,156
No!

55
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,093
No!

56
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,065
Not Miyuki, too?

57
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:34,466
Can't be, it's not my fault!

58
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:36,105
It's not my fault!

59
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:37,443
Ms. Kumi!

60
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,742
I didn't do anything!

61
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:42,476
Ms. Kumi, wait!

62
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:52,815
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to barge in!

63
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,356
I heard a noise in here.

64
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:59,088
And....

65
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:01,431
That's fine, just leave, okay?

66
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:02,827
Sorry!

67
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:05,603
Whatever.

68
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,914
Help me, Mommy!

69
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:58,055
Anybody here?

70
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:01,056
Is that Kotomi?

71
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:11,328
I thought that was you.

72
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:13,129
What happened to you?

73
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,770
Miyuki, and Kenta!

74
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:22,175
Kotomi!

75
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:54,173
How are you feeling today,
my little precious princess?

76
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:57,483
I forgot.

77
00:08:57,984 --> 00:09:00,179
You can't answer me, can you?

78
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:06,717
Don't you dare scream
or make a lot of noise, got it?

79
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:14,593
I knew it was you, Isaku!

80
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,199
You sick bastard!

81
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:21,637
I almost forgot.

82
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:25,073
If I remember correctly, you hate me.

83
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:26,609
Maybe...

84
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,806
I can do something special
to make you like me.

85
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,947
Stop, don't touch me!
Please don't!

86
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:38,256
I'm sorry I was mean to you.

87
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:42,761
I'm sorry, I mean it! No!

88
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:46,857
Please, just stop it!

89
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:52,304
No!

90
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:02,241
Damned slut, you sound like
you're having a good time.

91
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,950
No, just let me go!

92
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:13,047
Enough!

93
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:17,662
I said that's enough, Isaku.

94
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:19,553
Munemitsu!

95
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,697
Thank god you're here!

96
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:24,436
Get this bastard away from me.

97
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:25,433
Untie me.

98
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:27,730
I'm really curious.

99
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:33,275
What makes you think I'm here
to help you?

100
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:37,946
What's wrong with you, Munemitsu?

101
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:41,981
A filthy scumbag can make you get wet.

102
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:44,982
You're no different from other women.

103
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:53,656
You'll fuck anything, as long as it's a man.

104
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:57,360
Disgusting bitch!

105
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,266
Now you know...

106
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,841
that deep inside, all women are whores!

107
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:10,708
They pretend to be a prim and proper lady.

108
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:14,283
Remove their mask,
and you see their true colors.

109
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:19,353
Rika, Mio, Kumi, Akemi and Miyuki, too.

110
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:23,929
Even your precious Kotomi.

111
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:25,223
Kotomi....

112
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,996
No!

113
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:35,103
Stop!

114
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:38,837
Stop!

115
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:42,745
Goddamn it!

116
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,340
But Kenta, that tape.

117
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,180
It's not worth watching.

118
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:50,347
It probably shows Mio...

119
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,389
getting raped.

120
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,453
Are we going to be okay?

121
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:07,866
Hey Kenta, let's go!

122
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,067
We'll be next if we stay here.

123
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:13,138
Hold on!

124
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:15,311
We need to find Isaku first.

125
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,806
Well...

126
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:20,776
before he finds us.

127
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:23,218
Just slow down, Miyuki!

128
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:24,989
Wait for us!

129
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,270
Wasn't that a lot of fun, my little princess?

130
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:53,378
I thought you might get a bit chilly.

131
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,892
This should keep you warm.

132
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:06,294
I can't!

133
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:10,060
No more!

134
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:14,565
Kenta?

135
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:16,068
Yeah?

136
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:19,909
About the restroom incident.

137
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:23,476
Just forget what you saw.

138
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:26,677
It was embarrassing.

139
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,088
You promise, right?

140
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:43,465
Wait for me!

141
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:47,169
Don't leave me!

142
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:53,607
Please!

143
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:57,778
We weren't going to leave you.

144
00:13:58,017 --> 00:13:59,712
Good.

145
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:03,916
Let's get going, guys.

146
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:05,255
Sure.

147
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:07,149
Yeah?

148
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:08,885
What happened?

149
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:11,287
Is she okay?

150
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:13,058
It's nothing.

151
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:15,865
So you can't tell me?

152
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:17,993
It's not that.

153
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:19,067
Kenta!

154
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:22,269
Come on, we need to hurry.

155
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:24,939
Yeah, we're coming.

156
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:29,948
It wasn't my fault.

157
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,313
I didn't do anything.

158
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,157
It really wasn't my fault.

159
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:13,650
Shit!

160
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:15,425
It won't budge.

161
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:19,895
Have you tried all the other exits?

162
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,926
How about emergency exits and windows?

163
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:25,731
It's been nailed completely shut.

164
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,433
I doubt it.

165
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:31,966
So that means Isaku's still somewhere
inside this building.

166
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:34,803
I'm scared!

167
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:49,951
No, no more!

168
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,630
Please don't!

169
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:58,667
Do you like me a lot more, sweetheart?

170
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:02,635
I do!

171
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,268
I swear to god I do.

172
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:09,475
Can't take it anymore!

173
00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:11,410
Say it!

174
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,747
Why don't you say it like you really mean it!

175
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:21,192
Bitch, cry!

176
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:30,227
Ms. Kumi!

177
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:37,207
No!

178
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:41,105
Ms. Kumi, I've been waiting
for you to arrive!

179
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:43,405
What's going on?

180
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:45,975
No!

181
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:49,579
Ms. Kumi...

182
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,855
Isaku taught me something.

183
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:53,852
Use force to get what you want.

184
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:57,052
Only then will I know its true value.

185
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,392
No, stop this, Jinpachi.

186
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:02,161
Stop it!

187
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:07,973
No!

188
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,769
Don't touch me!

189
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:11,705
Go away!

190
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,810
Get away from me!

191
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,608
No, not there!

192
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:24,480
Why don't you scream out loud...

193
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,882
just like your sexy teacher over there.

194
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,933
We haven't checked out this office.

195
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:45,804
Let's check it out.

196
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:49,306
It looks like it's empty.

197
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,043
Where the hell could Isaku be hiding?

198
00:17:53,953 --> 00:17:55,147
Wait a minute, Kenta!

199
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:57,016
What, Kotomi?

200
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:58,545
What is it?

201
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:02,321
I need to pee.

202
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:09,595
That's fine, but...

203
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,137
we should all go with you.

204
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:14,301
Come on, let's move on!

205
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,498
Can you wait there for a bit?

206
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:17,707
Sure, that's fine.

207
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,506
I don't think this is the time to be shy.

208
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:25,547
I can't, if Kenta comes.

209
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:27,618
Fine, just do it in here.

210
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:34,883
What's going on?

211
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:37,760
I need to talk to Kotomi in private.

212
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,724
All right?

213
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,764
Okay, that's fine with me.

214
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:47,438
Please don't tell Kenta about this.

215
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:49,001
I know.

216
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:53,177
I don't want him to think I'm the type
to do this...

217
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:54,843
in front of people.

218
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,452
What's wrong, Kenta!

219
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:11,587
Hey, Kenta?

220
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:21,364
Hide!

221
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:22,335
Yes.

222
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:32,682
No, get away from me, and let me go!

223
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:44,556
You know, I was planning on enjoying
you as my final victim.

224
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:47,028
In my original plan...

225
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:49,692
Kotomi was going to be next.

226
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,732
If you tell me where that girl is hiding...

227
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:59,808
I might set you free for the time being.

228
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:02,441
Where is Kenta?

229
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:05,375
What did you do to him,
you fucking psychopath!

230
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:12,252
I guess you decided to protect your friend.

231
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:16,988
No, let me go!

232
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,460
On my way here, I found a neat toy
in the science lab.

233
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:24,626
What is that?

234
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:29,732
I think internal cleansing
will benefit you greatly.

235
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:31,810
That means....

236
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:34,407
No, stop it!

237
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:37,241
Don't you dare, stop it right now!

238
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:43,418
This is much better than living
with the shame of betraying your friend.

239
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,125
It'll be a shame...

240
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:53,790
if I don't film this for Kenta's personal
viewing pleasure, don't you think?

241
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:58,635
No, stop, don't you dare film this!

242
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:00,338
Don't show Kenta!

243
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:04,936
Now you don't have to be shy,
little miss, right?

244
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,644
Please don't tape this!

245
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,008
How about it?

246
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:11,745
So, where is Kotomi hiding?

247
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:13,410
I don't know.

248
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:25,492
Is she there?

249
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:29,063
No, don't, you're wrong!

250
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:31,495
Run now, Kotomi!

251
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:33,928
I knew it.

252
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:36,297
No!

253
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:40,201
Stop, please don't touch Kotomi!

254
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,244
Don't!

255
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,677
An innocent girl wouldn't be wearing
such sexy underwear.

256
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:50,047
It's not about--

257
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:53,952
You reek like the smell of a ripe
and ready woman.

258
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:57,352
Stop, I'm begging you to stop right now!

259
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:00,722
Just stop, Isaku!

260
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:17,746
Why is that kids have no clue about
shameful behavior in public nowadays.

261
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:19,283
I didn't mean to!

262
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:22,479
See, you're soaked in your own piss.

263
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:25,991
I'll clean it up for you.

264
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:29,558
No, please stop, that's really disgusting!

265
00:22:36,068 --> 00:22:36,625
No!

266
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,567
No!

267
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:41,970
No, get away!

268
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:50,478
Kotomi!

269
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:10,066
You taste like milk.

270
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:11,697
Go away!

271
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:16,033
You should blame your so-called friend
for giving you away.

272
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,354
What happened?

273
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:41,226
Where's Kotomi and Miyuki?

274
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:53,710
It's just you and me inside here, little girl.

275
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:59,480
I'm the only person that can see
what's happening.

276
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:15,196
As you promised, you're going to empty
everything out completely for me.

277
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:19,265
Please...

278
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:23,166
promise me, don't say anything to Kenta.

279
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:25,103
I don't want him to know!

280
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:29,080
You should be worrying
about yourself right now.

281
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,781
No!

282
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:38,514
I can't take this!

283
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:45,456
Kotomi!

284
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:54,905
It hurts!

285
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:01,505
No, don't!

286
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:04,615
No!

287
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:12,020
This is just as I've planned.

288
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:16,454
Everything is going perfectly,
like I imagined.

289
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:36,541
Very good.
I love to see the look of shame...

290
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:39,549
on women's faces
while they're getting degraded.

291
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:45,922
No!

292
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:37,459
Previews

293
00:27:58,991 --> 00:28:02,927
