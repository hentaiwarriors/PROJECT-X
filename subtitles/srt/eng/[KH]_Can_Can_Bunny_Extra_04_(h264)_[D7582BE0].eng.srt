1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,680
l'm Kenta Ochiai, a typical college student.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,740
Lately l've scored with seven different women!

3
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,480
Some might say it's just because of Suwatee's magic,

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,680
but there's more to it than that!

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,310
Something about me makes girls crazy!

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,750
l'm a bad boy!

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,360
l've had this girl!

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,430
And this girl! And this girl!

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,090
They're all mine!

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,730
Hey, hey, hey!

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,490
They're mine! Mine! Mine!

12
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,200
He gets lucky for the first time in his life and he goes crazy.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,770
What a loser.

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,230
You guys, give it a rest!

15
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,130
Damn! l can't believe you're running around in this heat!

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,850
How long are you planning to freeload off me, anyway?

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,740
You've been here two weeks already!

18
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,310
Well, what do you think, Suwatee?

19
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,820
Come on, it's alright...

20
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,750
We're all having so much fun.

21
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,520
lt's too hot! Don't come near me!

22
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,220
Hey, Kenta, you in there?

23
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,900
What is it, Saiki?

24
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,260
l need to ask you a favor.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,970
lt's not something weird, is it?

26
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,640
No, it's a sweet deal!

27
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,770
l can't keep my resort hotel job anymore. Do you want it?

28
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,870
You get three meals a day, and there are gorgeous girls everywhere.

29
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,810
Seriously?!

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,490
<i>The only man in a harem!</i>

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,760
<i>l can get laid every day all summer!</i>

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,310
<i>l've got a woody just thinking about it!</i>

33
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
Substitute part-time job?

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,330
There's no one else who can do it.

35
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,670
l can't say no when my buddy asks for help.

36
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,570
What?!

37
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,040
You seem a little too excited to me.

38
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,940
l am not!

39
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,170
Oh, really? Then, l'll tag along with you!

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,720
No! No! l'm not going for fun!

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,080
This is definitely suspicious!

42
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,650
Shuree!

43
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,030
Hey, Taitei! What do you think you're doing?

44
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,990
ls this any way to treat your brand new wife?!

45
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,800
Silence, Shuree!

46
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,970
l know that you used the power of the star to have sex with that man!

47
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,880
Shuree! So you really did!

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,870
You knew how l felt, too!

49
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,570
You traitor!

50
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,450
Like l said, it never happened!

51
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,850
Kenta, tell her!

52
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,290
Don't be embarrassed, Shuree.

53
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,450
l still remember how you cried and confessed,

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,630
''Kenta, don't forget about me!''

55
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,420
There's no way l would say such a stupid thing!

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,100
Shuree, calm down.

57
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:36,610
l am taking away your powers as a goddess for a while.

58
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,940
What did you say?

59
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,810
Suwatee, the same goes for you.

60
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,840
For your punishment, you will both spend a little time as humans.

61
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,790
No way.

62
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,460
Please, wait a minute!

63
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,900
What is this?

64
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,850
How appetizing!

65
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,120
Thanks for the meal!

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,880
Don't get excited!

67
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,020
No!

68
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,520
Wow!

69
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,280
Gorgeous girls everywhere!

70
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,220
Kenta! Slow down and stop drooling.

71
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,120
Fine...

72
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,820
President Hotel, President Hotel...

73
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,730
Oh, that's it!

74
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,440
Welcome! Welcome!

75
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,640
Sweetheart! Come stay with us!

76
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,900
We have good rooms! How about it?

77
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,130
Excuse me.

78
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,510
Sir, are you looking for a hotel?

79
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,180
Uh, no... You're Sanada, right?

80
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,080
l'm Kenta Ochiai, the new guy.

81
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,510
You finally came! l've been waiting, partner!

82
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,190
Who are these girls?

83
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,160
They came along with me.

84
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,700
They want to work part time too.

85
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,260
Can you use them?

86
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,320
Well, it's pretty last-minute.

87
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,460
Please, Mr. Sanada!

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,200
We'll work really hard.

89
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,500
Pretty please.

90
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,900
Well, if you're that desperate...

91
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,910
Alright! l'll find something for both of you!

92
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,640
Thank you, sir!

93
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,020
Okay then, put your stuff in the car.

94
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,190
lt's beautiful here.

95
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,690
lt really is.

96
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,470
ls this the hotel limo?

97
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,850
Wait!

98
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,900
Amazing! This is paradise!

99
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,910
l'm so glad l'm alive! Girls...

100
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,170
Not that one! Ours is over here.

101
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,780
No way!

102
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,890
Saiki, you bastard! You lied!

103
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,150
You set me up!

104
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,490
No! No! No!

105
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,760
lf l give up now, l won't be able to accomplish my goal!

106
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,290
Girls, where are you from?!

107
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,180
Feels so good!

108
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,350
Mr. Sanada, this hotel is really quiet. Where are the customers?

109
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,330
An old miser named Arisugawa put up that huge luxury hotel...

110
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,290
...and stole all my customers.

111
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,270
My business is non-existent, thanks to him.

112
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,930
Hey, sweetie!

113
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,470
Want to go for a swim?

114
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,700
Miss, do you have a moment?

115
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,800
Let's do lunch.

116
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,050
Damn! No luck at all!

117
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,510
What's up with this?

118
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,080
You'll never score without our help!

119
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,840
What did you say, you midget?

120
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,450
Who are you calling a midget, you stupid mortal?!

121
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,650
You wanna fight?

122
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,560
What's with him?

123
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,000
ls he crazy from the heat?

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,260
That idiot...

125
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,150
lce cold juice! Beer! lnner tubes!

126
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,820
lce cold juice! Beer! lnner tubes!

127
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,880
We also give oil massages!

128
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,630
Hey, Mr. Sanada, this is the Sunday Hotel's private beach, isn't it?

129
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,990
We'll get in trouble.

130
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,300
Shut it. lf we get caught, then we get caught.

131
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,960
Stop being so nervous.

132
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,160
But...

133
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,640
So our ''regular'' customer is here.

134
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,940
lce cold juice! Beer! lnner tubes!

135
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,280
This is bad, Kenta! Run for it!

136
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,300
Sanada, you again? Don't you ever learn?

137
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,850
Oh, she knows you, Mr. Sanada?

138
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,250
So hey, what's your name?

139
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,350
No! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

140
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,820
They're security for Sunday Beach.

141
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,980
They're the Amazon Gang.

142
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,820
Oh, l see.

143
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,490
l'm Miyuki Himuro. Nice to meet you.

144
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,330
Nice to meet you.

145
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,850
Kenta.

146
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,750
Hey, Suwatee, what do you think of this?

147
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,620
What is it?

148
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,200
Swimsuit, a swimsuit. We're at the beach, after all!

149
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,160
But...

150
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,030
Hey, get me this swimsuit.

151
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,660
Huh?! But we...

152
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,500
Just shut up and do it!

153
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,660
R-Right...

154
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,100
Here goes!

155
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,920
Wow! This is great!

156
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,680
Hurry up and change too, Suwatee.

157
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,050
Okay...

158
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,190
Kenta might fall for you yet.

159
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,000
You have to at least give it a shot.

160
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,900
Do you think so?

161
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,560
Yeah, go for it! Go for it!

162
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,190
Are you trying to kill us?!

163
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,810
Stop it! Stop!

164
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,620
Stop it, please!

165
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,800
No charge for the towing service!

166
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,060
Kenta, where are you?

167
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,780
H-Help!

168
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,180
Are you okay?

169
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,950
Yes... somehow...

170
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,860
No! This is too embarrassing!

171
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,560
lt's all right, Suwatee! Have some confidence!

172
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,800
You look so cute, Suwatee!

173
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,620
Hey, guys! Welcome to the grand opening of our beach bar!

174
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,070
How about a drink with Shuree and Suwatee?!

175
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,170
Shuree!

176
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,830
Now, Suwatee... Business! Business!

177
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,350
Um... What would you like to drink?

178
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,550
What's your name?

179
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,550
How old are you?

180
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,610
Are you free tonight?

181
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,850
Shuree, do something!

182
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,950
Oh, all right.

183
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,730
Well now, little boys, if you don't behave, l'll close the bar.

184
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,840
So, Mahoko, you're that old miser's...

185
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,040
...l mean, the president's granddaughter?

186
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,750
But really, you guys have a lot of guts to compete against my grandpa.

187
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,590
He can't be that bad.

188
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,360
He's so eccentric and stubborn...

189
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,490
...and l'm totally bored.

190
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,470
Sometimes l sneak out like this.

191
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,100
But now l'll be on your side!

192
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,950
Please do! Please do!

193
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,180
lt'd be great if a cute girl like you were helping us, Mahoko.

194
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,510
Everyone's waiting! Hurry!

195
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,170
Hey, wait a minute, girls!

196
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,210
Where are you going, Mr. President?

197
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,460
lt seems rather lively in front of Sanada's hotel.

198
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,930
What's going on over there?

199
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,260
We've received information that he has hired three part-time workers for the summer.

200
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,860
What a pain in the neck.

201
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,870
l thought l would run him off this summer.

202
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,740
That reminds me, is Mahoko back?

203
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,140
No, she hasn't returned from the beach.

204
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,220
Surfing again?!

205
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,810
lt's all she does, morning to night!

206
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,820
Really? And who was it that first interested her in surfing, Mr. President?

207
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,630
This is definitely what you would call pennies from heaven!

208
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,510
Suwatee and Shuree have saved this hotel!

209
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,220
They must be the Goddesses of Luck come down to Earth!

210
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,350
Oh no, Mr. Sanada! How did you guess our true identities?

211
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,160
ldiot! Shuree, shut up!

212
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,960
Gee, this is fun!

213
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,830
lt's been a while since l've had so much fun! Look, l'm dancing!

214
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,670
l'm a really good dancer!

215
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,370
Hey, Kenta, were you hitting on some girl this afternoon?

216
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,210
See! Watch me!

217
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,640
So did you score?

218
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,010
You sure are a cheap drunk!

219
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,610
l'm Sanada the samurai!

220
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,600
So, maybe you wanna have a go at it with me?

221
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,670
Samurai Sanada!

222
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,080
Hey, Shuree!

223
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,390
Samurai Sanada!

224
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,820
This isn't what you promised!

225
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,620
Why are you two so upset?

226
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,920
And this is really funny!

227
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,670
Good grief! A drunken goddess...

228
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,110
Oh!

229
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,450
She looks so sweet when she's sleeping.

230
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,670
<i>What was that?</i>

231
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,870
<i>lt felt so familiar.</i>

232
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,960
Are you adjusting to life as a human?

233
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,450
lt's probably harder than life in heaven, huh?

234
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,460
No...

235
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:54,800
l always wished l could feel the wind and water like you, Kenta.

236
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,100
l thought about it all the time.

237
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,490
So...

238
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,190
l'm happy that l get to be by your side, like a normal girl.

239
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,040
That's...

240
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,000
Sorry, l...

241
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,100
Here it comes! Here it comes!

242
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,940
Hey, Kenta!

243
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,780
Hurry up and get to the store before it closes!

244
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,610
Yeah! Yeah! l know!

245
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,910
Why does that always happen when it's about to get good?

246
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,190
But you can't be too pushy.

247
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,330
Even though she has a real body now,

248
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,600
Suwatee is still a goddess, you know.

249
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,870
So, tell us the truth.

250
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,740
Do you like Suwatee?

251
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,400
l don't know, this is all very sudden.

252
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,110
Huh?

253
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,310
What's wrong, baby? Too scared to stick up for yourself?

254
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,280
Hey! Keep your filthy hands off me!

255
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,580
You spoiled brat! You making fun of me?

256
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,530
That big hotel of yours is killing our business!

257
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,430
Maybe you need to get off your butts and work a little harder!

258
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,730
Bitch!

259
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,500
Lay off, buddy.

260
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,570
Four guys against one girl...

261
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,180
He really never learns, does he?

262
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,840
Hang on a moment.

263
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,220
Real-life controller!

264
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,790
Go! Go!

265
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,720
What's with this guy?!

266
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,720
Get him!

267
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,900
Damn...

268
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,260
Bastard!

269
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,640
All that time playing video games wasn't a waste!

270
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,780
Are you all right?

271
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,090
l'm okay. Fine!

272
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,270
Thanks a lot. You really bailed me out.

273
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,970
Sometimes it's smarter to just run, you know.

274
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,940
But l shouldn't have to run!

275
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,080
l didn't do anything wrong.

276
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,450
You're feisty, aren't you?

277
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,780
Don't expect me to ignore your activities on the beach because of this!

278
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,120
Do you understand what l'm saying?

279
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,520
Yeah, yeah. l understand.

280
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,850
<i>But l can give you a little ''thank you''.</i>

281
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,510
Are you crazy?! That's dangerous!

282
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,710
S-Stop it!

283
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,680
Wow! You're so wet!

284
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,780
Because... l haven't gotten any in a while.

285
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,910
So good! lt's been too long!

286
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,940
l think l'm going to come!

287
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,350
l can't hold on!

288
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,990
Me either! l'm coming!

289
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,950
Mahoko, wait a minute!

290
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,660
Where are you going?

291
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,460
Your English teacher comes today.

292
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,120
Just out for a walk.

293
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,100
Don't tell such transparent lies!

294
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,160
You've been acting suspicious all summer!

295
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,960
You're grounded! No more games!

296
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,070
Grandpa, that's not fair!

297
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:23,150
Mahoko, someday you will take over the management of this hotel.

298
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:29,280
You need to behave like a young lady so that you can find a husband to help you.

299
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,250
lt's my marriage so l'll find my own husband!

300
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,550
Stay out of my life, Grandpa!

301
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,450
Mahoko!

302
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,500
She gets worse every day.

303
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,670
Hey, Suwatee.

304
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,350
How'd it go last night?

305
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
Not good, l take it.

306
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,150
You've got to make a move...

307
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,930
...before that idiot falls for another woman!

308
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,300
Excuse me!

309
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,600
ls there a Kenta Ochiai here?

310
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,410
Are you a friend of Kenta's?

311
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,410
Morning, everyone!

312
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,970

314
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,320
l came to work with you guys, Kenta!

315
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,010
l want to help out!

316
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,320
Work with us? But it's so sudden...

317
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,190
You don't mind, do you? Please?

318
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,320
Please? Please? Kenta, please! Please?
