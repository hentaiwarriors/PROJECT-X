1
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,400
Here you go.

2
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,600
Thank you, Mom.

3
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,580
You look really good, Asuka.

4
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,240
Isn't it a little revealing?

5
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,320
You only get married once,
show off your beautiful figure.

6
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,060
Hey, look!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,560
Voilà!

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,630
I borrowed one.

9
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,930
You need to find someone good soon.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,800
I will get you a cute wedding dress
as a gift.

11
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,610
<i>It's not been such a long time</i>
<i>since that day.</i>

12
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,210
<i>It's as if everything was but a dream.</i>
<i>Not a trace is left.</i>

13
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,290
<i>Even those who I thought were my friends.</i>

14
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,800
It's time.

15
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,900
Okay.

16
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,340
I've come for you, Asuka.

17
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,350
No more daydreaming.

18
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,190
Was that Aya?

19
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,570
Aya?

20
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,610
What's wrong?

21
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,530
What's wrong, Aya?

22
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,240
You're big now.

23
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,220
Hey.

24
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,480
You're leaving me behind and growing up.

25
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,660
What're you saying?
We'll always be together.

26
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,790
<i>We're friends.</i>

27
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,670
I got their clothes.

28
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,880
Miku, don't spill it.

29
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,460
No more. Help me, Mom.

30
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,490
Sakura, Miku's talking to you.

31
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,570
Help.

32
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,280
Why don't you say something to her?

33
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,140
Because I'm sucking you off.

34
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,420
How can a mother talk like that?

35
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,930
Don' be so mean.

36
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,030
You made me swear
I'd be just another woman to serve you.

37
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,050
Don't do it rough anymore.

38
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,790
How many times do I have to tell you?

39
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,690
A pampered kid like this one
likes it a little rough.

40
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,990
She's my slave. I make the rules.

41
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,560
Yumiko.

42
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,420
We can play your games,
but know your place.

43
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,860
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,170
Behave like a slave.

45
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,970
Please, stop, Asuka.

46
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,090
No!

47
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,920
<i>I want to run away somewhere far away.</i>

48
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,160
I'm home.

49
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,150
Sis?

50
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,660
Asuka?

51
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,920
Mom. Miku.

52
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,730
Aya, if you keep on crying, I can't help you.

53
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,410
If you tell me, maybe I can help.

54
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,940
It's too late. Because of me, Asuka is...

55
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,150
It's all my fault.

56
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,150
What happened to Asuka?

57
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,030
No!

58
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,200
You liked it in the asshole.

59
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,070
Don't!

60
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,600
Sakura made love here
every night and you two were born.

61
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,140
I'm going to do the same thing to you.

62
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,480
Please, don't.

63
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,520
Don't just cry.
Watch your sister become a woman.

64
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,460
Help me, Sis.

65
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,780
Miku...

66
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,560
No!

67
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,990
It hurts!

68
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,960
Miku.

69
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,440
It hurts!

70
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,320
It hurts!

71
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,730
It hurts!

72
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,580
It hurts!

73
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,760
Who are you?

74
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,350
What're you doing?

75
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,440
Who are you?

76
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,430
Are you all right?

77
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,960
You.

78
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,160
Ryosuke.

79
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,030
Yumiko!

80
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,040
What's the commotion downstairs?

81
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,810
I'll go take a look.

82
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,930
Miku.

83
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,410
Yumiko, why?

84
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,970
Watch out!

85
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,010
Ryosuke!

86
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,170
I didn't know.

87
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,870
Now I see why Asuka was acting like that.

88
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,710
It's all my fault.

89
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,210
Let's go.

90
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,980
Where?

91
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,250
We have to save Asuka!

92
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,820
No.

93
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,960
I have no face to show her.

94
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,630
You're scum.

95
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,780
Sis?

96
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,750
You have learned to enjoy men.

97
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,240
Enough, already!

98
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,510
I like tough bitches.

99
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,140
But maybe I'm not just bluffing.

100
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,230
You mustn't. No!

101
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,330
I know. You want more.

102
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,070
Please stop!

103
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,970
We're both women. Don't be embarrassed.

104
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,850
Don't just stare.

105
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,890
No!

106
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,400
- Give me your ass.
- No.

107
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:37,230
I'll push it into your precious hole,
while your boyfriend is watching.

108
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,730
Asuka.

109
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,080
Yumiko, tell them to stop.

110
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,410
It's not clean there.

111
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,380
Don't look. Please.

112
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,460
<i>Someone help me.</i>

113
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,250
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

114
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,130
It feels good.

115
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,350
<i>I'm surprised how you let yourself go.</i>

116
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,460
No wonder your sister is twisted.
You've been her mother.

117
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,920
She sent her friend a threatening letter.

118
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,860
Don't say that.

119
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,980
Asuka is making the same noise now.

120
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,520
Swaying her big boobs.

121
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,960
One day I'll have you all side by side.

122
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,570
Tamami.

123
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,700
You're late.
You have to show up as soon as I call you.

124
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,240
I had to go to practice.

125
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,580
Shit, get naked and join these two.

126
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,490
What, do it now.

127
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,700
Tamami?

128
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,800
Tamami, you killed...

129
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,410
I wanted my brother
to see me run in the race.

130
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,210
You know
he doesn't have much more to live.

131
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,080
I wanted to encourage him anyway I could.

132
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,520
I thought I'd do anything for that.

133
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,730
But I was wrong.

134
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,860
When I saw you,
I thought I was seeing myself.

135
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,940
It made me sick.

136
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,770
I knew I was doing something disgusting.

137
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,430
Tamami...

138
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,280
Aya.

139
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,280
I don't care what happened
between you and Asuka.

140
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,590
But...

141
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,690
Don't do anything you'll be sorry for!

142
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,720
Let's be responsible for
what we each have done.

143
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,540
Stop.

144
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,280
No!

145
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,880
Don't.

146
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,220
Please. Don't move.

147
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,160
No.

148
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,230
A gift from our Master.

149
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,840
Miku and I have sworn to serve them.

150
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,810
You must, too.

151
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,450
Don't be ridiculous.

152
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,520
We'll make sure you will.

153
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,090
You saw me, so this'll make us even.

154
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,160
No, please don't!

155
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,060
It's cold.

156
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,130
No!

157
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,940
It's inside me.

158
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,780
I'm not done with you yet.

159
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,420
No more.

160
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,650
No more. Please. For the love of God!

161
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,590
I can't take it anymore!

162
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,560
Don't move.

163
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,090
<i>I want to go away. I want to run away.</i>

164
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,170
<i>But I have nowhere left...</i>

165
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,710
<i>... to run.</i>

166
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,240
<i>It's so good.</i>

167
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,720
Good old days.

168
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,760
<i>It's so good.</i>

169
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,090
The history of Yumiko growing up.

170
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,530
It sure is.

171
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,200
<i>More! Give me more!</i>

172
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,440
No more. Let me go to the bathroom.

173
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,240
I can't hold it anymore.

174
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,880
You can do it here.

175
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,320
I will wash you thoroughly.

176
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,400
I found your weak spot.

177
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,280
It's about time.

178
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,800
You like to pee, don't you?

179
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,380
I can't hold it.

180
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Look, back here, too.

181
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,920
I can't hold it. Don't look.

182
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,420
Mom, Miku, no more!

183
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,360
What is it?

184
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,570
<i>Yumiko!</i>

185
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,330
I'm sorry.

186
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,240
Your mother's masters.

187
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,450
They're all dead.

188
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,370
But how fragile motherhood is.

189
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,050
We gang-raped her
and gave her an enema and...

190
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,280
...she readily swore
to give up her husband and her family.

191
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,680
She had her husband
and daughters to protect.

192
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,390
The more you have to protect,
the more fragile you become.

193
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,000
I have nothing. So I'm strong.

194
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,640
You're wrong.

195
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,200
What?

196
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,800
I just realized something.

197
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,080
You can be strong
because you have something to protect.

198
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,420
I've always wanted to run...

199
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,720
...but when I realized
there was nowhere to run...

200
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,750
...when I realized I had to protect
my mother and Miku...

201
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,170
...then I had courage. And maybe that's...

202
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,070
Do you know
why I did not rob you of your virginity?

203
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,280
I didn't want you to discover
the pleasure of a woman.

204
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,780
Before I killed you!

205
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,480
Aya?

206
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,250
Aya. You.

207
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,450
Yumiko.

208
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,250
Let's end it.

209
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,420
No! I have to die.

210
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,660
I have to die.
Revenge is not going to bring you back.

211
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,640
Give me back everything I have lost.

212
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,930
Don't worry. Let's go look for it.

213
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,940
This time I'm coming with you.

214
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,440
We'll be together forever.

215
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,340
I'm sorry, Asuka. I'm sorry.

216
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,420
Why are you apologizing, Aya?
I don't understand.

217
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,690
I'm really sorry.

218
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,790
Aya!

219
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,960
<i>That was the last time I talked with Aya.</i>

220
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:05,260
<i>Before everything became public</i>
<i>and the people showed up.</i>

221
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:10,800
<i>Aya and others disappeared and</i>
<i>nobody could find them.</i>

222
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,510
<i>Tamami had to leave school</i>
<i>after her murder of Mr. Miyake.</i>

223
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,810
<i>But Reika's father used his influence...</i>

224
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,550
<i>... to cover up the whole thing.</i>

225
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,850
<i>My life went back to the way it was.</i>

226
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,660
<i>I dated Ryosuke for a while, but...</i>

227
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,230
<i>... I married someone else.</i>

228
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,130
<i>I thought it was all over.</i>

229
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,800
<i>I wanted it to be all over.</i>

230
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,030
She was not in the dressing room.

231
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,500
Where has she gone to?

232
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,360
Asuka, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

233
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,960
Aya.

234
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,500
I promised Tamami I would be responsible.

235
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,700
Asuka.

236
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,440
Long time no see.

237
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,500
What are you doing?

238
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,580
Stop.

239
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,280
No!

240
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,140
I did make you a woman here.

241
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,080
Once you taste it, you'll never forget.

242
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,220
You haven't changed.

243
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,600
Size is the only thing
you've got working for you.

244
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,530
Don't say that.

245
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,140
Aya.

246
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,240
I will love you, Asuka. Forever and ever.

247
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,850
Have a nice day.

248
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,040
Time for your walk.

249
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,170
Yes, Ma'am.
