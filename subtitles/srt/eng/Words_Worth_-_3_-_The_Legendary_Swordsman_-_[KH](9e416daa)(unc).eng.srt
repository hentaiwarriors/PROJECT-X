1
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:19,393
Mystral Window!

2
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,590
Where am l?

3
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:59,363
Who am l?

4
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:30,766
<i>Once again, Light and Shadow were
divided, and 20 years have passed.</i>

5
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:53,122
Wow, he looks like Sir Pollux!
He sure does!

6
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:56,596
Pollux?
Hurry, hurry.

7
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:06,196
<i>He's smiling! Sir Pollux is smiling!</i>

8
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,331
He sure is! He is smiling!

9
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:49,842
<i>I can't remember. Who am I?</i>

10
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:17,136
Beautiful.

11
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:03,246
<i>I never knew I was
such an incredible swordsman.</i>

12
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:06,348
Are you all right?

13
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,258
Yes.

14
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:17,098
Were you hurt?

15
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,670
<i>Oh, yes, no, please....</i>

16
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:22,206
Please, do not get any closer.

17
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:36,218
<i>l haven't even thanked him.</i>

18
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:47,397
This is no place
for a dirty vagrant like you!

19
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:53,867
Go away! Go!

20
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,234
<i>Ouch. You're awfully cruel.</i>

21
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:00,545
Oh, do you want to fight?

22
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:03,242
<i>Let's do it!</i>

23
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:06,279
We have nothing better to do!

24
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:13,718
<i>No, l never meant to....</i>

25
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:21,291
So he struck down
that violent bear with great ease?

26
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:25,634
Yes. l also saw bright light,
as if there was lightning.

27
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:30,104
<i>Mew, maybe you shouldn't
take strolls alone in that forest.</i>

28
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:34,436
Grandpa, you sound just like Mother.

29
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:37,476
Maria said the same thing?

30
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,681
<i>But, Grandpa, it's important to have
many experiences while l'm young.</i>

31
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:45,418
<i>Otherwise l'll have a tough adult life.</i>

32
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,019
You got me there.

33
00:05:57,871 --> 00:05:59,668
Stop, what are you doing?

34
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,070
What a pathetic fellow.

35
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:12,645
<i>That man.... Grandpa, it's him!</i>

36
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:14,385
What?

37
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:23,086
That man?

38
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:30,800
Guards, listen to me!

39
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:35,800
<i>That's Sir Fabris. What does he want?</i>

40
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:40,710
Kill that man!
Surround him now and kill him!

41
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:44,207
Sir Fabris? Sir Fabris gave us an order!

42
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,952
<i>Let's kill him!
Grandpa!</i>

43
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:56,455
<i>What're you doing, Grandpa?
He saved my life!</i>

44
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,091
Just watch.

45
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:33,227
l see. You have no memory.

46
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:39,837
But your face, your build,
and the way you moved...

47
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:43,974
<i>...you're a dead ringer for the man
known amongst the Tribe of Light...</i>

48
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:46,204
...as the best swordsman ever: Pollux!

49
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,769
Pollux?

50
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:52,079
Well, then, until you regain
your lost memories...

51
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:57,588
...why not stay with us at this castle
as Pollux, the Swordsman of Light?

52
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:03,786
After all, you saved the life
of my granddaughter, Mew.

53
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:25,245
Look, Mother, how cute.
lndeed.

54
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,620
<i>That man....</i>

55
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,357
Oh, Sir Pollux!

56
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,614
l have to hurry.

57
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:07,052
l hate this so much.

58
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:47,856
Without a doubt,
a fragment of the Words Worth Tablet!

59
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:53,972
Very good of you to have found it.

60
00:09:54,407 --> 00:10:00,004
Sir Wartoshika, will
the Tribe of Light attack us again?

61
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:03,508
They will. They surely will.

62
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,450
To take back
this Words Worth Tablet fragment!

63
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:13,750
<i>lt's 20 years since the passage
was sealed between Light and Shadows.</i>

64
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:16,692
They have not made a move.

65
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:18,993
We must not lower our guard!

66
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:24,196
The fact is, we are so close
to completing the Words Worth Tablet.

67
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:28,598
<i>What's wrong, Tessio?
No, no.</i>

68
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,802
Dear Sir Wartoshika.

69
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,377
Finally our wish is coming true.

70
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:41,476
Sir Astral would be so glad
if he were still alive.

71
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:43,249
<i>Astral isn't....</i>

72
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:47,054
l mean, Sir Astral
has never been confirmed dead.

73
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:50,426
<i>You can't talk like that.</i>

74
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:53,930
<i>Sharon. lt's all right.
Yes, sir.</i>

75
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:57,565
Listen, all of you!

76
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:03,234
<i>Stay on tactical alert
so we're ready whenever they attack us!</i>

77
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:05,835
You hear me?
Yes, sir!

78
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:22,923
<i>l'm so bored.</i>

79
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:25,594
<i>Can't there be some excitement?</i>

80
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:31,830
l have to hurry.

81
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:36,331
Or the Words Worth Tablet
may get resurrected.

82
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:45,105
<i>That's Tessio. What's the hurry?</i>

83
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,386
Could that be damn Menza?

84
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:54,950
What was that light?

85
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,592
l hope nobody saw that.

86
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:03,158
Sounds interesting.

87
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,365
<i>l think l'll check it out.</i>

88
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,799
What brought you here, Menza?

89
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:16,607
Nice way to welcome your partner!

90
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,109
<i>l've suffered so much to come over here.</i>

91
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,225
<i>You're making me sick, too.</i>

92
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:30,792
Well, you did save me
the trouble of going over there...

93
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:32,793
<i>...so l shouldn't complain.</i>

94
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:35,493
<i>You've got business to discuss with me?</i>

95
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:39,469
<i>Why would l bother to come over
here if l didn't have a business to discuss?</i>

96
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,006
That is so true.

97
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:45,443
Who would imagine a secret
rendezvous between the two of us?

98
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:50,979
The Commanders of Light and Shadows.

99
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:56,917
The Commander of the Tribe of Light?

100
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:14,836
You.

101
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:18,638
Thank you so much for before.

102
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:21,077
<i>You're welcome.</i>

103
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:24,044
My grandfather told me...

104
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:28,611
...you were going to the Gold Mine
to find the passage to the Shadow World...

105
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:32,385
...and find out about
the Words Worth Tablet fragments.

106
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,757
l found this in the forest.

107
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:39,261
A tablet fragment.

108
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,367
What? ls it true?

109
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:47,505
l have a similar piece. Look, here it is.

110
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:51,504
Really? Sir Pollux, where did you find it?

111
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:54,704
<i>l don't know. l've always had it.</i>

112
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,078
Probably since
even before l lost my memory.

113
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,585
The two pieces became one!

114
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:12,789
Damn!

115
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:31,272
How bizarre!

116
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:00,642
Watch out!

117
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,389
<i>l guess it's over now.</i>

118
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,790
<i>l'm scared.</i>

119
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:22,561
<i>There may be terrifying force
we know nothing about....</i>

120
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:27,236
Please help me stop trembling.

121
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:31,874
Mew.

122
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,402
<i>l'm afraid.</i>

123
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,708
Please hold me so l can forget this horror.

124
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:41,978
Miss Mew.

125
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:15,846
<i>What's wrong, Menza?</i>

126
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:21,088
<i>l've sent out my double
to locate the Tablet fragments, but...</i>

127
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:23,354
...it seems someone destroyed it!

128
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:26,956
What? Who could do that?

129
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:29,399
lt must be him.

130
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:32,004
The very reason why l came over.

131
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:37,333
The Legendary Swordsman?
Probably.

132
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:40,975
We have to get rid of him quickly.

133
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,215
<i>Sir Pollux. l'm so embarrassed.</i>

134
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,961
<i>Miss Mew, you're beautiful.</i>

135
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:01,088
<i>No, don't look at me like that.</i>

136
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:05,669
<i>l'm hot, l'm going crazy.</i>

137
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:33,625
Sir Pollux. l need it.

138
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:38,428
<i>But l'm a vagrant with no past,
are you okay with that?</i>

139
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:41,830
Sir Pollux.

140
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:44,202
Here it is.

141
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:01,950
Oh, something is in here.

142
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:09,020
<i>lt's a crystal key.
My mother wants you to take it.</i>

143
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:12,522
lt will surely be of use.

144
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:15,757
<i>Thank you. Then....</i>

145
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, yes.

146
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:22,166
See you later.
Take care of yourself.

147
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:24,735
Thank you.

148
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:36,646
Please, come back!

149
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:47,563
The Legendary Swordsman Pollux.

150
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,568
Somehow we have to kill him.

151
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:55,539
And locate the tablet Wartoshika
has been secretly rebuilding.

152
00:19:56,308 --> 00:20:01,336
<i>And destroy it again.
Otherwise we won't survive.</i>

153
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:06,115
Destroy the Words Worth Tablet again?

154
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:08,218
<i>What's with them?</i>

155
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:12,251
This looks bad, l should get out.

156
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:19,095
<i>Who's there?
Damn!</i>

157
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:20,693
Menza!

158
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:45,053
l made it

159
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,220
No!

160
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:08,872
The passage between Light and Shadows
is somewhere in that mountain.

161
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:14,780
The crystal key?

162
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:24,090
There?

163
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:26,359
No!

164
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:32,196
What a nice view.

165
00:21:32,404 --> 00:21:35,396
<i>Let me go! What're you
going to do to me, you monsters?</i>

166
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:41,177
You have no business calling us monsters!

167
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,276
<i>This is what we're going to do to you!</i>

168
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:22,718
You will pant and moan
in the valley of pleasure and be our slave!

169
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:39,853
Say, will there be a war?

170
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,598
Why, Ariadonne?

171
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:48,606
l saw many swordsmen gathering
at the castle early this morning.

172
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,241
Did you?

173
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:53,406
<i>A war again....</i>

174
00:23:58,117 --> 00:23:59,846
<i>Sir Astral....</i>

175
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:03,749
<i>Look, that lady over there
looks like she's sick.</i>

176
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:12,464
Are you all right?
Lady, are you all right?

177
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,699
<i>l can't remember anything.</i>

178
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,070
<i>l just can't remember.</i>

179
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:25,968
Lady, look out!

180
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:37,415
You have crossed Light and Shadows?

181
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:44,662
She flew away.

182
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:47,995
She was mumbling something.

183
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:50,967
She looked fine. Good for her.

184
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:58,372
That mother and her daughter?

185
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:06,016
So this is the cave that leads to
the passage between Light and Shadows...

186
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:08,985
...that was sealed
during the war 20 years ago.

187
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:39,116
Must be this way.

188
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:56,059
The passage is sealed. This must be it.

189
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,828
The crystal key.

190
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:02,602
<i>What's going on?</i>

191
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:23,025
<i>Who was that girl? She looked like Mew.</i>

192
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:26,261
<i>What happened in my past?</i>

193
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:29,564
<i>Who's there?</i>
