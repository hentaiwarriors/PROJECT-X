1
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,580
Go back!
We have to save Kayo!

2
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,250
- Just calm down!
- But, Kayo will be...

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,120
What do you think you
can do in that situation?

4
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,250
But...

5
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,560
If they're just interested in acting
like an average sex cult...

6
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,890
then we may be all right.

7
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,020
What?

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,900
But we have to worry
if the god they were...

9
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,700
worshipping turns out
to be the Demon Beast.

10
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,600
What? The Demon Beast?

11
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,890
What are you doing?

12
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,560
To be expected, Holy Mother.

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,570
You have no idea of the limits
of your love spring.

14
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,110
But, you see, it's still not quite enough.

15
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:37,010
We'll need a great deal more
to call forth the Great Savior.

16
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,310
Stop it!

17
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,940
"Do it!" she said, and in it slipped.

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,910
Now, how many more
can we fit in there?

19
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,850
But we have to save Kayo!

20
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,520
They're waiting for the moon.

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,720
Huh?

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,930
Kayo should be safe until
the moon crosses the meridian.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,300
Until then, we have to prepare.

24
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,630
Prepare?

25
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,300
I only came down here
to Earth by chance.

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,570
You mean...

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,600
Yes. It was only by chance
that I was there to save you.

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,740
I'd broken into the shrine...

29
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,980
while tracing a weak
Demon Beast life signal.

30
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,180
The fact they were worshipping
the Demon Beast there...

31
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,350
my meeting you
and losing all my agents...

32
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,400
and having to face the Demon Beast
alone; all of it was by chance.

33
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,900
Though I certainly wish I could take
credit for a well thought out plan.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,270
This may be my karma.

35
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,970
Well, I guess you're not alone.
You have me.

36
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,410
Oh?

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,070
Yes, you're right.

38
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,540
Sorry! I forgot how cold it was
to a regular human body.

39
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,910
Come in here.

40
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,880
Huh? Whoa!

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,320
You'll be perfectly warm in here.
Just don't get any funny ideas.

42
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,360
Oh?

43
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,000
That'll be kinda hard,
seeing as how I'm hanging onto...

44
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,090
a beautiful woman like you, Captain.

45
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,330
Muneto! What are you doing?

46
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,740
Stop it!

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,430
Huh?

48
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,090
You're awake?

49
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,370
What am I?

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,910
Oh, God! I'm sorry! I...

51
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,570
Yes, I know. This was to blame.

52
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,540
Look.

53
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,480
What is it?

54
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,450
I found something mixed in
with the fluids from your penis.

55
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,180
An unknown substance...

56
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,910
along with the secretions of
several normal human women.

57
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,850
DNA?

58
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,720
Yes, but not from any Earthly organism.

59
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,280
The Demon Beast's?

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,090
The things you've been fighting
up until now have just been tools...

61
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,120
made by the Demon Beast by joining
its DNA with Earth life forms.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,470
Then, you mean?

63
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,300
That ceremony is calling
the real Demon Beast down...

64
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,340
from the Sea of Dimensions.

65
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,470
To do what?

66
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,040
Destroy everything.
Its vengeance against all life.

67
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,920
And Kayo is?

68
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,150
Just another tool it needs to reach
the next level of its existence.

69
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,980
Even Miyuki?

70
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,690
Yet another tool.

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,430
Although she seems very easily
possessed by the Demon Beast.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,490
There may be a deeper connection there.

73
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,080
Wait, that's the Soma fruit
I ate before.

74
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,440
I see.

75
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,500
Huh?

76
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,010
Tha- That's the Demon
Beast's DNA again!

77
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,610
This species of plant supposedly
became extinct long ago.

78
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,450
- I didn't think it still existed.
- Huh? But...

79
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,790
The Interplanetary
Mutual Observation Agency...

80
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,920
managed to save a small
number of people from...

81
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,490
the so-called continent of Mu
before it sank 12,000 years ago.

82
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,620
What?

83
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,660
But, considering that the Mu
queen's bloodline survived...

84
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,940
her descendents must have
preserved the fruit as well.

85
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,210
Our records show that
the queen resettled in Japan.

86
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,550
Stop it, please!
I can't take anymore!

87
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,990
Good! Let's try to put in
as many as we can.

88
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,390
No! They won't fit!

89
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,290
Oh, I doubt that.

90
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,560
No.

91
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,900
Please.

92
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,830
We've only gotten 16 in.

93
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,810
I expected you'd be able
to hold at least 50!

94
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,750
We won't stop until
we've put all these inside.

95
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,180
Stop it!

96
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,580
You're going to rip it apart!

97
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,920
Look! I got another one in!

98
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,600
No use.

99
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,270
Can't hold it anymore.

100
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,070
They're coming out!

101
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,240
No!

102
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,620
No! No! No!

103
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,860
Oh, Kayo, whatever shall
we do with you?

104
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,830
To think the Holy Mother
would be built so small.

105
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,640
We'll just have to do something
about squeezing the ones inside you.

106
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,510
Please, stop it!

107
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,640
Turn back to normal.
Miyuki, please!

108
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,350
Miyuki?

109
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,320
Miyuki, you're...
The Demon Beast has you again?

110
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,650
Toh, the Great Savior has made it clear
that he needs me.

111
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,570
Now, he wants me to squeeze
the Soma fruit inside of you.

112
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,570
With this.

113
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,270
Stop it! Miyuki, please!

114
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,000
Can't you see that you are being totally
controlled by the Demon Beast?

115
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,440
Not at all. I work for the
Great Savior because I want to.

116
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,980
I have spent my whole life
working with the great savior...

117
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,850
to achieve what I have
desired because I wanted to.

118
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,690
Here we go, Kayo.

119
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,820
No! No!

120
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,730
Stop it!

121
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
Oh, Kayo! You're wonderful!

122
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,630
Even tighter than I thought you were.

123
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,030
My tool's getting numb!

124
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,270
The Soma fruit is being
properly crushed inside of you.

125
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,370
Soon, Kayo. Soon,
you will know the Soma fruit's power.

126
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,650
How does it feel, Kayo? Doesn't the
Soma fruit make you feel wonderful?

127
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,290
Oh! Yes! Wonderful! Wonderful!
It feels incredible! Oh, yes!

128
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,200
Well then, I'll make you
feel even better.

129
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,000
This is the power of the Great Savior.

130
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,090
He loves your womb so much...

131
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,730
that he has given us the power
to love each other.

132
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,070
Look, Kayo. Your love juices
are flowing nicely, now.

133
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,680
You're soaking. And your little
clit's gotten so big, too.

134
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,950
What a dirty little slut you are!

135
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,080
No, not there!

136
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,790
Oh, God!

137
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,630
No. Oh, God!
It's incredible! Oh! Oh!

138
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,970
Oh, God! I'm coming!
I'm coming! I'm going to...

139
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,280
We have enough
of the holy juices!

140
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,300
The Holy Mother's love juices are
calling out to the Great Savior!

141
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,770
Igu-na-ii! Igu-na-ii!
Sufuru-skuun!

142
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,640
He who was, still is.
He who is, shall be.

143
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,800
The master of the world,
the Great Savior!

144
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,410
Travel no more in the sea
of primeval dimensions!

145
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,750
Come to this dimension we know!

146
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,080
To the dimension of the lost continent,
sealed beneath the ocean.

147
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,990
Let the dimensional doorway
be opened and answer my prayers!

148
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,490
Lord Beast, arise once more!

149
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,020
I am reborn!

150
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,490
I am reborn!

151
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,460
You've done it, La Ru!

152
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,520
I am made manifest!
I am made manifest!

153
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,430
When he destroys the Earth,
only my bloodline will survive.

154
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,200
And then my long dreamed
of ambitions will be realized.

155
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,340
And now, revive our lost continent!
Revive the glory we lost!

156
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,140
Cr out, all of you!

157
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,210
Let the Lord Beast hear
your cries of ecstasy!

158
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,300
The moans of joy!

159
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,570
Seek out your happiness!
Cr out loud!

160
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,240
Let all your carnal happiness be
carried up to the Lord Beast!

161
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,650
Oh, Lord Beast!
Answer our calls to you!

162
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,190
That should work against the
effects of the Soma material.

163
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,330
You should have no more flashbacks.

164
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,500
Whew! Great!

165
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,010
Wouldn't want to try
and jump you again, Captain.

166
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,170
What the hell?

167
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,240
The Demon Beast has appeared!

168
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,440
- What?
- Don't panic.

169
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,750
We still have some time
before he reaches Earth.

170
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,190
Now, let's go save Kayo.

171
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,520
- Let's go!
- Roger.

172
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,620
Mother! Mother!

173
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,720
Wait for me! Mother!

174
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,080
Now, let the final ceremony begin!

175
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,490
It's all over for you, Kayo.

176
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,020
Between the smell of your
womb and the love juices...

177
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,660
we've released with the Soma fruit,
we know the Great Savior will come.

178
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,430
Come for you.

179
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,860
And then Muneto will be mine alone.

180
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,450
Kayo!

181
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,340
Muneto!

182
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,250
Huh... Muneto?

183
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,460
Muneto!

184
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,410
Is Miyuki...

185
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,140
Yes. Forget about her.

186
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,610
But it looks like we've stopped
the Demon Beast's resurrection.

187
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,050
Look!

188
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,820
The moon's back to normal.

189
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,170
Damn it all! Damn it all!

190
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,840
Everything's been burned to ashes.

191
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,910
It would have worked.

192
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,640
I know in my heart,
it really would have worked!

193
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,910
Damn it! But I won't give up!

194
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,180
I still have some
of Kayo's love juice.

195
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,120
With this... With this, I will
call the Great Savior once more!

196
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,540
My 12,000-year dream...
it will come true with me!

197
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,370
What's happening?

198
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,150
The dimensional portal
is obviously open again!

199
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,780
Somehow we didn't stop
its rebirth after all!

200
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,790
Dammit! And after we
managed to save her...

201
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,220
He'll come after her again!

202
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,230
We won't let him have her.

203
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,490
Help me, Muneto.

204
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,060
What are you...

205
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,570
I'm going to transplant
her secretion gland into me.

206
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,830
The Demon Beast chases her
because of the pheromones she emits.

207
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,140
If I transplant the gland,
we'll be able to hide her from it.

208
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,240
But then you...

209
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,070
I don't think you understand, Muneto.
It's my duty.

210
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,810
I have to do this, if only for all
the friends it took away from me!

211
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,880
Please, help me.

212
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,080
All right.

213
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,580
Lord!

214
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,410
Lord Beast...

215
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,750
Lord, I've been waiting for you!

216
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,890
Ah, La Ru. My corrupt queen.

217
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,160
Think back! To that day,
12,000 years ago.

218
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,970
Am I La Ru?

219
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,540
Father?

220
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:25,180
You remember. With that dagger
you killed your father, King La Mu.

221
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,260
You were a shrine maiden,
forbidden contact with men.

222
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,600
And for that you hated your father!

223
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,260
And then your destiny was foretold.

224
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,670
The man you were fated to
carnally know was your own brother!

225
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,080
I have decided to grant you your wish.

226
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,440
It's no use!

227
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,950
My father has unjustly
imprisoned my brother...

228
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,950
in the turbulent Sea of Dimensions!

229
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,990
I'll never see him again!

230
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,620
Nothing is impossible for me!

231
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,920
I will search the thousands of
alternate dimensions to find him.

232
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,290
Will you do that for me?

233
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,320
I swear. However, you must give me
your mother in exchange!

234
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,270
My mother?

235
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,900
Eons ago, your mother was
once my mother as well.

236
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,380
She gave me life.
A holy karmic duty for her.

237
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,410
Very well! And in return
you will give me my brother!

238
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,380
Now, give him to me!

239
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,920
Have you forgotten?

240
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,660
What?

241
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,320
Think back!

242
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,860
You never gave me the queen
because she killed herself!

243
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,300
Give me my reborn mother!

244
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,670
What is?

245
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,740
So long as I don't have my mother,
you will never see your brother!

246
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,070
- Are you all right, Captain O?
- Yes.

247
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,700
We have to finish off
the Demon Beast...

248
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,960
while he still can't find Kayo.

249
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,640
But, before that, you must
give me all your true power.

250
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:33,380
But, in order to fight the Demon Beast,
I must be allowed to make love to you.

251
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,610
But... I mean...

252
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:40,450
Please don't worry. She won't
be waking up for a little while.

253
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,960
All right, Captain O.

254
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,160
Please, that's such an impersonal name.

255
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,930
Call me Olga.

256
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,970
Olga?

257
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,400
A real woman's name.

258
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:12,050
Olga, what I tried to do to you before
was because of the Soma fruit.

259
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,560
This time I'll do it to you
from my heart.

260
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,760
Don't be silly, Muneto!
What about Kayo?

261
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,800
Just...

262
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,340
Just make love to me
the way you should.

263
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,400
Sorry.

264
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,460
It's all right. Do it.

265
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,840
Here we go.

266
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,570
Olga...

267
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,770
Muneto...

268
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,840
Olga...

269
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,070
Mu... ne... to!

270
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,680
MUNETO!

271
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:09,290
No! No! They aren't
like Mother's juices!

272
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:14,600
The scent, the flow...
All wrong! I need Mother!

273
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,330
Without Mother, it won't work!

274
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,170
That smell!

275
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,970
What is this? It's her scent.

276
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,570
My body trembles.
Such delicious captivation!

277
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,380
Mother! The scent of Mother!

278
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,940
This time! This time!

279
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,680
I will have my way!

280
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,450
Mother! Where are you going?
Mother!

281
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,360
Olga.

282
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,560
Brother!

283
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,080
Miyuki?

284
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,370
What the...

285
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,570
Brother!

286
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,740
Miyuki!

287
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,180
Brother! Brother! Take me!

288
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,120
Take me, my brother!
I've waited so long to have you again.

289
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,390
I'm not your brother!

290
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,050
Have you forgotten, my brother?

291
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,530
When you learned of my corruption...

292
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,260
you refused to love me...

293
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:54,200
despite how much my body
burned for your loving touch.

294
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,930
Again? Karma from
ANOTHER past life?

295
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,340
I can see it in your eyes.

296
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,440
Since you refused to love me
that time before...

297
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,540
if you don't love me now...

298
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,980
then I will die!

299
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,950
Stop it! Don't let your karma
from a past life control you!

300
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,990
I killed my father,
and knowingly doomed my mother...

301
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,750
by promising her to another.
I may as well die!

302
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,620
Stop this!

303
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,590
Brother!

304
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,790
La Ru... I will return your love.

305
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,600
We must stop this
endless cycle of hatred!

306
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,460
Brother!

307
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,830
Are you ready, La Ru?

308
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,520
Yes.

309
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,190
The moon's back to normal.
The cycle has been broken.

310
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,460
Om Ma Ire-yasu Sowaka!

311
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:37,470
Om Ma Ire-yasu Sowaka!

312
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,120
Mother!

313
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,380
Mother!

314
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,900
Now I will have my way!

315
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,240
Is this really my karma?

316
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,810
Come, let us both return
to the ends of space and time.

317
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
No!

318
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,830
This bodes ill.

319
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,230
I tried to use the mystic arts...

320
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,940
to peer across the galaxy, but failed.

321
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,540
Have the Demon Beast and Captain O...

322
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,950
both vanished into
the Sea of Dimensions?

323
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,610
Or else?

324
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,950
Muneto!

325
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,990
Muneto! Muneto!

326
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,970
Muneto!

327
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,970
Muneto, speak to me! Muneto!

328
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,410
Muneto!

329
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,470
Kayo.

330
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,520
You're all right. Thank God.

331
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,980
It's over. Everything.

332
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,990
Just as long as you're okay.

333
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,350
Where's Miyuki?

334
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,330
I can't find her.

335
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,670
I see.
