1
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,070
Time flies. Has it been a year already?

2
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,310
Sorry for being late.

3
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,630
This doll will make you feel less lonely.

4
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,830
I can't believe you put his doll on the grave. It's in bad taste.

5
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,510
You came here as well.

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,350
I-I was just passing by.

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,550
N-Nothing more.

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,550
Wh-Why are you smiling!?

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,310
Got something to say!?

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,190
No, not really.

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,790
Even if you're just passing by, would you like to pray?

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,390
Okay.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,990
<i>I don't want to admit that this was fate.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,270
<i>Still, I wonder if you were happy.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,030
<i>Did you ever feel happiness?

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,270
Flutter of Birds
Wings of Angels

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,350
Part 1: Reminiscence

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,550
One Year Ago

19
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,990
Excuse me. This is the last stop.

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,790
The last stop.

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,950
I see. You're from Mitsuru-san's household.

22
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,110
My name is Shinya Sinclair.

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,830
I know. You're the son of her sister, aren't you?

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,550
My name is Yukiyanagi Yuzu.

25
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,990
Yuzu is written in hiragana.

26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,430
So, how much farther to the church?

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,270
There's still a long way to go.

28
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,590
I see.

29
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,110
Do you find the scenery strange?

30
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,470
No, not really, but...

31
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,750
This country is where my mother was born,

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,430
and where she met my father and fell in love with him.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,990
I used to wonder a lot about what it might be like,

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,190
and what the people here were like.

35
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,390
Wondering if I could sense my mother here.

36
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,270
Wh-What's wrong?

37
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,190
Shinya, you're wonderful.

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,990
What?

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,790
You're wonderful.

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,870
Thank you.

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,470
No way, a bear? In the middle of winter?

42
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,630
Run!

43
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,070
Ouch!

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,750
Shinya!

45
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,430
Shinya.

46
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,270
Don't worry about me. Hurry up and run!

47
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,590
But...

48
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,150
Oh, there you are!

49
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,470
You were taking so long I was becoming worried.

50
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,030
You're Shinya-kun, right?

51
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,110
I'm Mizueda Mitsuru. Nice to meet you.

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,070
Oh, yeah, nice to meet you.

53
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,350
My foot...

54
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,750
Ouch!

55
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,110
It hurts!

56
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,590
You've sprained it.

57
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,590
It will take about two weeks to heal,

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,270
so you'll be staying in the hospital for now.

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,750
What? I just got here!

60
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,830
Now, now, look on the bright side.

61
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,710
At least you didn't break anything.

62
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,350
Hey...

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,790
Shinya, I'm sorry!

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,710
Huh? Why are you apologizing?

65
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,550
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

66
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,830
It's fine.

67
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,990
Right?

68
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,910
Yes.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,190
Well, I'll go fetch your luggage.

70
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,830
Take care, Sinclayer-kun.

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,430
Um, would you mind using the standard pronunciation?

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,630
I thought I did.

73
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,070
I'd say it was quite original.

74
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,870
I see. I'll work on it, Sinclayer-kun.

75
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,190
Yeah...

76
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,470
I'll see you two later. Have fun!

77
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,150
M-Mitsuru!

78
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,190
Umm...

79
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,830
Yes?

80
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,070
Huh? Wh-What is that!?

81
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,870
I'm Doll-Yuzu! I'll speak on Yuzu's behalf!

82
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,790
Wh-Why are you laughing?

83
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,670
I-I'm sorry. So, what do you want to talk about?

84
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,350
Well, you see, this hospital has a nice cafeteria.

85
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,110
Would you like to go there with me?

86
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,390
Sure, let's go.

87
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,910
Great!

88
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,550
Umm...

89
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,550
You looked, didn't you?

90
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,350
Well, they showed, so...

91
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,310
You saw it!

92
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,830
I can't believe you did that!

93
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,310
I'm sorry. I didn't bump into you on purpose!

94
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,270
Shut your mouth!

95
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,270
From now on, you're my slave. Got it?

96
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,310
Slave?

97
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,430
Do something like that again, and you'll be sorry.

98
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,190
Got it, slave?

99
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,270
Her name is Kayaba Kazura-chan.

100
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,470
It seems she's from a really wealthy family.

101
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,510
I see. That explains it.

102
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,070
Her lungs are weak, so she came to Kuramachi to convalesce.

103
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,870
Hard to tell from the way she acts.

104
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,070
We can't judge her illness just by appearances.

105
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,670
We're not doctors, you know?

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,830
You're right.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,910
Um, Shinya?

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,870
I'm back!

109
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,870
Welcome back. Did they have coffee beans in stock?

110
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,070
Yes, I bought everything you asked for,

111
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,110
but it started snowing on the way back.

112
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,230
We might get a blizzard tonight.

113
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,950
I-I'm sorry!

114
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,590
Sh-Shinya!

115
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,790
Oh, I can't believe this!

116
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,630
Sheesh, Akane-san.

117
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,030
I'm very sorry. Are you okay?

118
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,670
Y-Yes, I'm okay... or not!

119
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,830
Shinya, hang in there. Shinya!

120
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,390
This feels great.

121
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,070
Yuzu, let's wash each other!

122
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,470
I couldn't tell him.

123
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,870
Have you fallen for him?

124
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,070
If you have, then make sure you're prepared.

125
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,430
Eh? Prepared for what?

126
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,430
You know, man and woman: in it goes!

127
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,230
Don't blush.

128
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,590
Now then, I wonder how much you've grown.

129
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,990
Stop it.

130
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,910
Oh, now you've done it! Take this!

131
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,630
No!

132
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,430
No!

133
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,670
<i>Yuzu hasn't come by yet today.

134
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,910
Slave! What are you doing here?

135
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,830
It'll take much more than that for me to forgive you, understood?

136
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,910
Yes, I understand.

137
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,910
Very well then.

138
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,670
You've done it not just once, but twice!

139
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,150
This time I will not forgive you!

140
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,510
Hey, slaves are not supposed to run away!

141
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,110
Wait up! Wait up!

142
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,630
— Where are you?

143
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,190
— I'm saved.
— Where are you?

144
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,510
She's a nightmare.

145
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,230
Penguins are birds.

146
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,790
What? Hey, you...

147
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,190
Oh no, an eel got up my nose.

148
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,110
Good morning.

149
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,230
I wish we could have met under better circumstances.

150
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,430
Narahara Narumi... The same name as this clinic?

151
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,150
Narahara Nao is my father.

152
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,230
Here you go.

153
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,550
Thank you.

154
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,550
You're welcome.

155
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,470
Only Kazura-chan comes to visit me, so I'm happy you stopped in.

156
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,390
K-Kazura-chan comes here often?

157
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,830
Yes, she comes here to talk...

158
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,830
but she hasn't been by today.

159
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,030
I-I see.

160
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,110
If Kazura-chan didn't come, I'd always be alone.

161
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,190
I read books and rest in the sunlight, but I'm still lonely.

162
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,350
You... You really do have a lot of books here.

163
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,350
Have you read them all?

164
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,470
Yes, I love books!

165
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,550
Even though I'm stuck inside,
reading takes me on many adventures.

166
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,750
The only thing I can do is spend time.

167
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,390
Huh? Don't you ever go outside?

168
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,870
I was born with a weak body,

169
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,230
so this room and the books my mother left me are all I have.

170
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,310
I'm like... a bird in a cage.

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,190
It's not uncomfortable, though.

172
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,350
I've gone on many adventures through these books.

173
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,390
I've visited distant countries or gone to old Japan.

174
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,230
I've played with fairies and strange creatures.

175
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,070
I do this every day, so I'm not bored.

176
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,510
I think that's strange.

177
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,030
It's difficult to say this, but the worlds inside books are fiction.

178
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,350
They're not real adventures, are they?

179
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,950
But I don't know what else to do.

180
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,030
That's easy.

181
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,350
You just have to look at a bigger world. Like this!

182
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,550
There are people and animals out there, too.

183
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,590
Adventures just waiting to happen!

184
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,390
It would be a waste to just stay inside.

185
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,310
Shinya-san...

186
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,390
You have to look forward.

187
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,270
If you do, your dreams are sure to come true, right?

188
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,870
Narumi, look at the beautiful flowers I brought you.

189
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,110
Slave! What are you doing here!?

190
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,870
Well, this is...

191
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,590
Oh, so Shinya-san's last name is "Slave"?

192
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,110
N-No! Kazura-chan decided that on her own!

193
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,110
You bastard!

194
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,030
When you refer to me, address me properly!

195
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,670
Besides, you were about to make a pass at my best friend, weren't you?

196
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,110
Jeez, I won't forgive you!

197
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,830
H-Hold on! I wasn't getting close to anyone!

198
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,910
Shut up! I don't believe you!

199
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,470
Don't run away, slave!

200
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,430
Hey! Not again!

201
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,470
Stop it, would you?

202
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,310
— Wait up, you monster!

203
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,270
— I'm a patient in recovery!
— Wait up, you monster!

204
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,950
<i>The outside world.

205
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,070
...and then it started snowing heavily,

206
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,550
and I ended up looking like a snowman.

207
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,510
Are you listening?

208
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,470
I-I'm sorry!

209
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,790
You were talking about the fish, right?

210
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,950
No, I wasn't! What's wrong with you today?

211
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,110
You're spacing out.

212
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,950
Hey, Kazura-chan...

213
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,630
What?

214
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,550
Should we go outside?

215
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,390
Here.

216
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,550
What have you done to Narumi?

217
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,710
I haven't done anything.

218
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,950
Don't act innocent!

219
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,470
Narumi has never wanted to go outside before,

220
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,950
but now all of a sudden she wants to!

221
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,870
Narumi-chan?

222
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,470
Shinya-san!

223
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,270
I decided to go on a little adventure!

224
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,310
Narumi-chan!

225
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,470
What have you done to her?

226
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,430
I haven't done anything, just...

227
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,910
Just what?

228
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,310
I just opened her window.

229
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,030
Her window?

230
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,310
Hello!

231
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,430
Tomorrow I'll go on another adventure.

232
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,790
Not yet...

233
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,430
I don't want this to end.

234
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,630
My dream is just about to start.

235
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,230
Hey!

236
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,110
I haven't done anything today!

237
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,550
What are you talking about?

238
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,470
I just wanted to say thanks, for Narumi.

239
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,350
What?

240
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,750
D-Don't misunderstand.

241
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,710
I still consider you my slave.

242
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,830
Don't get any strange ideas.

243
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,470
Narumi-chan?

244
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,870
It's Shinya.

245
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,310
I'm coming in.

246
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,550
Narumi-chan?

247
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,630
I wonder where she went.

248
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,790
S-Sinclayer-kun!

249
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,510
Please pronounce it correctly.

250
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,230
Have you seen Narumi?

251
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,390
No, she wasn't in her room.

252
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,150
Has something happened to her?

253
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,590
I can't find her anywhere.

254
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,390
What?

255
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,950
I've been looking for her, but she isn't in the hospital.

256
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,830
She knows her limits and shouldn't be walking around.

257
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,150
Maybe... I think she's outside!

258
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,430
What!?

259
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,310
— Narumi! Answer me, please!

260
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,350
— Narumi!
— Narumi! Answer me, please!

261
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,790
Kazura-chan, you'd better go back.

262
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,310
No, I'll help look. Narumi is my best friend.

263
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,990
Narumi!

264
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,670
Narumi-chan!

265
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,790
She's not here.

266
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,230
Let's look somewhere else.

267
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,070
Narumi-chan!

268
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,430
Where could she be?

269
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,630
Dammit, this is all my fault.

270
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,270
These footprints...

271
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,910
No way. A real bear?

272
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,470
Oh, no!

273
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,310
Wait! It's me.

274
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,510
That voice is...

275
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,710
N-Narumi-chan?

276
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,950
Yes, I'm Narumi the bear.

277
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,230
Thank God.

278
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,870
With this leg, I wouldn't be able to run from a real bear.

279
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,470
Why are you out here?

280
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,150
After listening to you, I wanted to see more of the world outside.

281
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,270
This bear costume keeps me from getting cold.

282
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,990
B-But that's...

283
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:28,910
Just like you said, going outside is really fun!

284
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,910
This is what a real adventure is like!

285
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,910
Adventure?

286
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,350
Yes! An adventure, an adventure!

287
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,630
<i>That's right.

288
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,070
<i>For her this is a huge adventure.

289
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,070
Let's have a snowball fight.

290
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,910
Okay.

291
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,590
Take that!

292
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,270
Take that!

293
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,630
That was fun. I've never enjoyed myself so much.

294
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,710
I see.

295
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,510
But from now on, you shouldn't go outside on your own.

296
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,630
Okay.

297
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,510
Um...

298
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,470
Um, I want to tell you something.

299
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,430
What is it, Narumi-chan?

300
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,230
Well, you see... I... I...

301
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,710
Are you okay, Narumi-chan?

302
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,950
Are you all right?

303
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,390
Y-Yes.

304
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,790
I'm sorry. I... I...

305
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,230
Don't say anything else. Let's hurry back!

306
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,390
Everything is your fault! She is... Narumi is...

307
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,790
How is she doing now?

308
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,270
The doctor said the next few days will be critical.

309
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,790
What?

310
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,670
I'm sorry. I went out without telling you.

311
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,910
Don't worry. Did you have fun?

312
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,950
Yeah.

313
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,070
I see.

314
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,030
[No Visitors]

315
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,790
I can leave?

316
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,790
Your foot has healed.

317
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,750
You should be able to leave.

318
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,710
I see.

319
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,150
Don't worry about Narumi.

320
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,350
I'm grateful for what you've done.

321
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,350
This hospital had always been like a cage to my daughter,

322
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,590
but you took her outside of it.

323
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,990
As her father, nothing could make happier.

324
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,270
Thank you very much, Sinclair-kun.

325
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,910
You're welcome.

326
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,270
This is it.

327
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,710
Shinya-san...

328
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,350
It's been a while.

329
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,310
Are you feeling better?

330
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,990
Yes! I'm feeling a lot better.

331
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,750
Good. I feel relieved.

332
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,390
Um, I couldn't tell you this before. Will you listen?

333
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,390
Sure.

334
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,270
I'm sorry for making you worry.

335
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,870
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

336
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,590
I played with you, even though I knew you were sick.

337
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,910
This isn't your fault!

338
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,750
I did it of my own free will!

339
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,790
So, you're no to blame, Shinya-san!

340
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,150
Besides, I had a really wonderful time.

341
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,870
I became a bear and had an adventure in the forest.

342
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,990
For anyone else, it would just be a walk,

343
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,790
but for me it was very special,
because it was the first adventure in my life.

344
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,550
Narumi-chan...

345
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,430
Please, listen to me and promise not to laugh.

346
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,150
In this room, I've dreamed of the future and many other things.

347
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,590
Dreamed about the kind of person I want to be,

348
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,030
what kind of job I'd like to have,

349
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,950
and even what kind of person I'd want to marry.

350
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,550
Strange, isn't it? I may not even have a future...

351
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,750
Don't say that! Everyone is entitled to dream!

352
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,590
"Future" is the word all my dreams lead to.

353
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,710
That one day, I'll run outside,

354
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,310
and live happily with the person I love!

355
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,670
That's my dream!

356
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,670
That's the future i want myself to have!

357
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,270
Shinya-san, I want to make this dream come true with you.

358
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,390
I want a future where you and I are together!

359
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,590
Narumi-chan...

360
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,230
Shinya-san!

361
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,990
You're beautiful, Narumi-chan.

362
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,550
Don't. I'm embarrassed.

363
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,550
Don't say that. Let me see you.

364
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,470
Oh, Shinya-san, you're a bad boy.

365
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,710
If you call me a bad boy, then that's what I'll have to be.

366
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,990
Do you like it?

367
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,070
I'm not sure how to explain it to you, but my body is...

368
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,950
Don't... Don't do that, Shinya-san! If you do that...

369
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,510
Are you okay?

370
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,390
Yes, I felt something through my body just now.

371
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,270
It's because you're feeling good. You're so cute.

372
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,830
This is...

373
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,470
This... This feeling is wonderful.

374
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,590
Wow, you're very wet.

375
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,470
Shinya-san, I... I...

376
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,670
I'll make you feel much better now.

377
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,550
No, don't look at me.

378
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,990
Nope. I want to see all of your body.

379
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,350
No. You can't lick a place like that.

380
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,710
No!

381
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,470
Narumi-chan, I'm going in.

382
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,470
Okay.

383
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,390
Does it hurt?

384
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,230
I'm fine. Please keep going.

385
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,150
Okay.

386
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,110
You shouldn't push yourself.

387
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,270
I'm fine! I want to feel you inside me.

388
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,950
I want you to fill me up!

389
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,350
I feel strange. What is... What is this?

390
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,510
Are you feeling it?

391
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,110
I'm not sure, but...

392
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,270
the depths of my body are getting hot!

393
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,790
I love this! It's all the way in!

394
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,270
Narumi-chan.

395
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,870
If you do that, I'm going to feel weird!

396
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,990
Narumi-chan, I'm going to...

397
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,350
Shinya-san, me too! Me too!

398
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,990
Aren't you cold?

399
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,910
No, I'm quite warm.

400
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,510
Narumi-chan...

401
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,510
I've finally become a normal girl.

402
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,550
Hello?

403
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,790
No one's here.

404
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,910
Hello, Suzuka-chan and Akane-san.

405
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,310
Kazura-chan!

406
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,350
What's the point of you coming now!?

407
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,990
No. That can't be...

408
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,830
It's not true! It can't be real, right?

409
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,870
Say something, Narumi-chan! Narumi-chan!

410
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,950
Narumi-chan!!
