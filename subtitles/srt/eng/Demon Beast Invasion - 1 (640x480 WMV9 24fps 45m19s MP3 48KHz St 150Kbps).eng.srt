1
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:46,445
Yet another
unsuitable woman...

2
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:52,293
- What?!
- I've found you, demon!

3
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:06,735
Come back here!

4
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:33,092
Shinichi Kasu. So, the failed
teacher has become an agent.

5
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:37,971
Under the Interplanetary Mutual
Observation Treaty...

6
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:39,832
...I sentence you to death!

7
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:44,973
Just try it... if you can!

8
00:05:54,757 --> 00:05:55,655
Stop!

9
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:00,728
You won't get away!

10
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,813
Are you okay?

11
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:23,751
Muneto... What the
hell are you doing?!

12
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:28,087
Kasu...
What happened to your face?

13
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:30,822
YOU happened to my face!

14
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:33,996
Don't just stand there,
after him!

15
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:35,087
Yes, sir!

16
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:41,003
Idiot!

17
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:46,439
And who's supposed to
drive me after you?

18
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:07,789
I called you and called you!
What the hell were you doing?

19
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:11,557
Well, I was sorta
occupied with a lady.

20
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:15,529
You were WHAT?!
I'm out here risking my ass...

21
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:18,500
...while you're dipping
your wick with some woman?!

22
00:07:18,808 --> 00:07:21,572
Hey, she wasn't
just "some woman!"

23
00:07:21,644 --> 00:07:26,707
If I wasn't doing this I'd
be a lot happier, believe me!

24
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:30,684
You expect to defend the peace
of Earth like that, you dipshit?!

25
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,448
Look out! Watch it!

26
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:31,172
Kasu...

27
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:38,652
Kasu!

28
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:44,953
Damn it!

29
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,991
Kasu! Kasu!

30
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:15,782
You will never capture me!

31
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:17,376
Today's the day,
right Kayo?

32
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,859
Stop it, Tsutomu.
Somebody's coming!

33
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:28,294
No one'll be coming at
this time of the day!

34
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:34,301
No!

35
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,066
It's that time
of the month for me.

36
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:40,836
Again?! I've never heard of
"that time of the month"...

37
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,105
...being 30 days long!

38
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:46,706
Don't you understand?
I can't wait any more!

39
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,055
Give a guy an
irresponsible boss...

40
00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:57,592
...and you get a helper
with lots of problems.

41
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:04,624
Muneto... He knows
what I look like, now.

42
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:08,768
You'll have to look
for him by yourself...

43
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:11,329
Take 'im out...
Got it?

44
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:27,720
Hold it!

45
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,519
What's your problem?!

46
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:36,127
Sorry about all this.

47
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:38,624
Wait!

48
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:39,690
What?

49
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:50,136
I was right... It's Muneto!

50
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:52,414
Muneto?

51
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,077
Kayo...?

52
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:00,485
Tsutomu?!

53
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:15,497
Jeez, this is really something.

54
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:18,404
It's been four... No,
FIVE years since you left.

55
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:22,475
It really is something.
You and Kayo at the same school!

56
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:25,938
Guess God wanted
us together again.

57
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:53,938
Did you tell her?

58
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:58,139
Kayo loves you, man!

59
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,611
And you love her, right?

60
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:08,646
So tell her how you feel!

61
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:09,989
But...

62
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:11,758
You have to!

63
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,489
Go and tell her. Okay?

64
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,961
I just don't know...

65
00:13:21,737 --> 00:13:26,504
I don't know if I can still
love her when we're apart.

66
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:30,277
Tsutomu, I want you to
take care of her!

67
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,912
What's with you?

68
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:34,405
You love her too,
don't you?

69
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:37,176
But... Well...

70
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:41,516
You'll take care of her.

71
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,861
Gotcha, buddy!

72
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:14,017
Hey, come on!

73
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:22,330
That promise is still
in effect, you know.

74
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:24,593
I don't want to hear
about you wanting her back.

75
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:25,964
Gotcha!

76
00:14:26,402 --> 00:14:28,666
Man, she's even
more beautiful now.

77
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:33,840
Bet you're jealous.

78
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:38,139
Shoulda had more foresight.
Damn right I'm jealous!

79
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:58,799
I'm back in one piece!

80
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:15,810
You dipshit!

81
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:21,579
Cutting out in the middle
of a case to go partying!

82
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:25,526
Come on, I've got
a life of my own!

83
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:28,155
Heroes don't have lives!

84
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:30,656
Listen.

85
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:34,495
We defend the
peace of the Earth.

86
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:41,606
Day and night, that's all
we should ever live for.

87
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:45,913
That's what real
heroes are made of!

88
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:49,149
Tiny little apartments.

89
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:52,517
Instant ramen meals.

90
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:57,789
No sex to speak of.

91
00:15:57,893 --> 00:16:02,227
Real heroes never
complain about any of that!

92
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:06,165
Real heroism
equals real poverty!

93
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:11,070
Muneto!

94
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,505
You just have
to remember this:

95
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:17,243
I hate scallion and
fermented bean curd!

96
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:23,244
My nose is more sensitive
than most people's.

97
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:27,354
So strong-smelling
food is right out!

98
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:28,818
Right, right...

99
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:32,483
Let's run through
this one more time.

100
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:38,066
There are two reasons why the Demon
Beasts are taking over human bodies.

101
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:46,531
The first is because they
just can't take Earth's atmosphere.

102
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:52,445
The second is the most important.

103
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:58,343
They're trying to cross-breed
with humans to adapt to the Earth...

104
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,514
...so that they can
conquer the planet!

105
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,114
You got that?

106
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,050
Yeah, but still...

107
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:07,519
YOU GOT THAT?!

108
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:08,989
Yeah...

109
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:21,643
So we gotta be suspicious
of anyone who's just...

110
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,111
...suddenly started
hitting on women big time.

111
00:17:26,215 --> 00:17:29,776
Gotta check 'em out!

112
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:32,119
You've gotta be kidding.

113
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,518
Understand, Muneto?

114
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:39,357
We're heroes who fight
for the peace of all space!

115
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:40,989
So get with it!

116
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,228
Oh boy...

117
00:18:19,468 --> 00:18:21,698
Being a hero sucks.

118
00:18:41,523 --> 00:18:45,983
I know how serious
Tsutomu was before...

119
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:57,499
But if I do it with anyone,
it'll have to be Tsutomu...

120
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:00,038
Coming.

121
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,748
Muneto!

122
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:13,954
A lady-killer?

123
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:17,114
Just if you might
know anyone like that.

124
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:21,327
Anybody who just suddenly
started really chasing women.

125
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:24,592
Well...

126
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,527
Oh yeah. There's a guy named
Maeda in my class like that.

127
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,432
It's like something's
come over him lately.

128
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:34,066
He's tried to pick up
lots of women already.

129
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:35,302
What's he look like?

130
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,809
I've got a class photo from
the beginning of the year.

131
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:41,807
Now, where did I put it...?

132
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:48,814
Okay... Hmmm...
Hold on!

133
00:19:49,992 --> 00:19:52,483
Kayo

134
00:19:57,432 --> 00:19:58,330
Don't!

135
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:01,759
You really love Tsutomu,
don't you?

136
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:04,235
I'm sorry.

137
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:19,353
Thanks for everything.

138
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:23,748
And you. It's really
great to see you again.

139
00:20:24,393 --> 00:20:26,953
- See you later, then.
- Later.

140
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,800
That son of a...!

141
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:09,165
So, that's Maeda...

142
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:08,652
- Tsutomu?
- Come on!

143
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:12,923
What's your problem,
Tsutomu?!

144
00:22:13,268 --> 00:22:15,532
Don't play dumb!
How could you, Muneto?!

145
00:22:15,604 --> 00:22:17,128
What?!

146
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:20,766
I know where
you were last night!

147
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:27,442
I love Kayo! I'm not just
going to let you take her!

148
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:31,683
Calm down.
I'm not trying to.

149
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:35,249
We were just talking
about old times last night.

150
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:36,221
Really?

151
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,454
You always did
jump to conclusions.

152
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:43,864
Not to say I wouldn't
like another shot at her...

153
00:22:43,932 --> 00:22:45,957
But hey, I can control myself.

154
00:22:47,903 --> 00:22:49,871
I hear you.

155
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,967
That was Kayo!

156
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:56,640
Police!
Call the police!

157
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:59,644
Somebody call an ambulance!

158
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,017
Excuse me. What's happened?

159
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:16,929
Kayo...

160
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:19,264
Tsutomu...!

161
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:36,946
I blew it.

162
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:39,076
...and that's what happened.

163
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:44,853
You dipshit! You had
him and let him get away!

164
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:47,284
But...

165
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:51,963
Okay, we're gonna pay a call
on Mr. Maeda tonight. Got it?!

166
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:05,739
Say...

167
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:08,681
You're one of Kayo Asakura's
friends, aren't you?

168
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:10,908
Yeah...?

169
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:38,936
Idiot!

170
00:24:39,781 --> 00:24:41,942
- Kasu!
- What?

171
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:48,946
We're too late.

172
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,621
Coming!

173
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:54,585
Tsutomu!

174
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:55,721
Hi.

175
00:24:55,797 --> 00:24:57,856
What're you
doing here so late?

176
00:24:57,932 --> 00:24:59,923
Thought I'd take
you for a drive.

177
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:04,061
Kasu! Look at this!

178
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:19,819
Looks like she's the next one.

179
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:22,252
Kayo...

180
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:38,194
Kayo!

181
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:53,214
We're too late!
Kayo...

182
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:56,048
Don't give up so fast.

183
00:25:56,725 --> 00:26:00,718
I said I had an
outstanding nose, didn't I?

184
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:06,735
She's got good
taste in perfume.

185
00:26:06,735 --> 00:26:09,101
I may be able
to find her.

186
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:10,367
Kasu!

187
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,672
I think Tokyo looks
best from here at night.

188
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:24,648
Really...

189
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:33,424
Kayo... I really want
this to be the night.

190
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:35,253
Tsutomu...

191
00:26:35,697 --> 00:26:39,030
Ever since we were kids,
I've only had eyes for you.

192
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:40,733
I love you.

193
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:42,702
I love you, too.

194
00:27:46,768 --> 00:27:48,099
Tsutomu...

195
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:55,776
Go ahead.

196
00:28:03,718 --> 00:28:04,742
I'm doing it.

197
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:54,733
Yes... Yes!

198
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:03,573
This time...
This time I go all the way!

199
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:27,723
Kayo!

200
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:45,818
KAYO!

201
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:54,922
Muneto...?

202
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:58,163
What a sorry couple of agents!

203
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,630
Kayo!

204
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,537
Die, demon!

205
00:30:11,112 --> 00:30:12,374
Shit...

206
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:24,390
Kasu!

207
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:30,731
Shit!

208
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:34,332
No!

209
00:30:34,802 --> 00:30:36,167
Kayo, let go!

210
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:38,634
That's Tsutomu!

211
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:40,239
What?

212
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:51,415
Tsutomu!

213
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:22,840
Please tell me.
What's happened to Tsutomu?

214
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,381
That thing...

215
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:36,391
That thing's an alien
from quasar PHL-5200.

216
00:31:51,012 --> 00:31:54,243
We call them Demon Beasts.

217
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:56,411
Demon Beasts...?

218
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:03,012
Their ultimate goal is the
conquest of the Earth.

219
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:07,856
But the atmosphere now isn't
suitable to support them.

220
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:23,367
That's why they have to take
over peoples' bodies. Use them...

221
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:25,709
No...

222
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,848
Muneto and I
are agents of the...

223
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,717
...lnterplanetary Mutual
Observation Agency.

224
00:32:36,324 --> 00:32:41,990
It was created to oppose any
illegal planetary incursions.

225
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:46,590
The people of the Earth still
don't know we even exist.

226
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:50,226
I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you, Kayo.

227
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:52,729
So then...

228
00:32:54,342 --> 00:32:57,743
What about Tsutomu?
Can you save him?

229
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:10,055
I'm sorry. Once a Demon
Beast takes someone over...

230
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:43,384
Tsutomu... I really thought
I could let you have Kayo...

231
00:34:07,014 --> 00:34:09,005
Now, of all times...

232
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:13,010
Why does my body...

233
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:20,355
That thing... disguised
as Tsutomu... was so...

234
00:34:27,368 --> 00:34:29,029
It felt so good...

235
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:36,370
Oh no...!

236
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:39,111
Tsutomu!

237
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:51,151
Hello...?

238
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:52,615
Kayo?

239
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:54,388
Tsutomu?

240
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:09,674
Kayo's on the move.

241
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:13,437
Just as I expected, the Demon
Beast's still after her.

242
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,481
Stop her, please!

243
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:17,710
The only way we'll ever
track this thing down...

244
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:19,479
...is to use her as a decoy.

245
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:21,452
How can you do
that to her?!

246
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:23,217
Link up with me ASAP!

247
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:26,722
Kasu...!
That scheming old...!

248
00:35:48,316 --> 00:35:49,476
Kayo!

249
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,211
Tsutomu...

250
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:53,082
You came, after all...

251
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:08,093
Let me give you
a taste of paradise!

252
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:30,988
Demon!

253
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:32,321
Muneto!

254
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,223
How dare you to that to them...
To Kayo... To my friend!

255
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:37,889
How dare you!

256
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:41,895
Just when things
were getting good!

257
00:36:50,845 --> 00:36:53,313
That toy can't hurt me!
It barely tickles!

258
00:36:58,919 --> 00:36:59,851
Damned invader!

259
00:37:00,488 --> 00:37:03,582
- Invader? Hardly!
- What?

260
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:09,195
One hundred million years ago,
our ancestors left this world...

261
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:13,063
...when an accident changed
the planet's environment.

262
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:16,068
We were the first
inhabitants of the Earth!

263
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,830
Bullshit!

264
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:26,244
Muneto!

265
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:29,539
Whatever happened in the past,
the Earth belongs to humans now!

266
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:32,420
They're invaders,
no matter what they say!

267
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,048
Demon Beasts who stole
your friend's body!

268
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:40,118
Muneto, the guns are useless!

269
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:41,458
Right!

270
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:45,254
How dare you use my friend!
Use Tsutomu...!

271
00:37:58,612 --> 00:37:59,909
Die!

272
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:04,909
Tsutomu...

273
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:12,257
Muneto!

274
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:27,932
Now to put you
out of my misery!

275
00:38:34,915 --> 00:38:37,179
Stop it!

276
00:38:37,952 --> 00:38:41,911
You're still Tsutomu!
Try to remember!

277
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:44,521
The man is dead!

278
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:49,495
Tsutomu, I love you!

279
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:54,230
It... It can't be!

280
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:55,962
Tsutomu!

281
00:38:58,272 --> 00:39:00,172
Ka... yo...!!!

282
00:39:00,274 --> 00:39:01,298
Tsutomu!

283
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:06,910
Now!

284
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:13,352
Muneto, shoot!

285
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,787
KASU!

286
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:27,027
Muneto, forget me!
SHOOT!

287
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,959
Muneto... I'm sorry
I used Kayo as a decoy.

288
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:01,458
It's up to you now.

289
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:13,572
Muneto... Finish him
off with your Blade!

290
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:16,447
Muneto...!

291
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:17,645
Tsutomu!

292
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:22,188
Muneto, finish him off!

293
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:24,247
Do it, Muneto!

294
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:49,906
Tsutomu... Kasu...!

295
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:13,495
Muneto...

296
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:15,906
Tsutomu!

297
00:41:18,112 --> 00:41:22,515
Muneto...
Take care of Kayo...

298
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:46,564
Goodbye, Kasu...

299
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,240
Tsutomu...

300
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:31,049
Thought you'd be here.

301
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:41,027
Cheer up! You're a hero,
who saved the Earth.

302
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:42,827
Kayo...

303
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:46,491
If you're down all the time,
you'll never get anywhere.

304
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,398
You're pretty tough.

305
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:51,898
Women have to be tough.

306
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:57,237
If you aren't,
you can't live...
