1
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,722
I have to run away!

2
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,954
I'm not going to feel
any pleasure from him!

3
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,528
Not from him!

4
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,163
A boat...

5
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,705
If I get on it...

6
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:56,052
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you on the boat.

7
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,758
I'm impressed that you carried it
all this way without dropping it.

8
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,822
I'll give you a reward for that...

9
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:09,498
...but first, I have to punish
you for trying to run away from me.

10
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,269
What's that look?

11
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,768
I guess you still have to
learn to be a slave, huh?

12
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,144
It seems like all that
training was not enough.

13
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:30,783
If you disobey me, I'll give
you a very harsh punishment...

14
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:37,224
You are not allowed to even breathe...

15
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,626
...without my permission.

16
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:50,268
Please someone help me...

17
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,742
...before I lose myself...

18
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:59,008
...before I break...

19
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:05,921
Chapter Two: Shoko Iyanagi

20
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,329
Damn, what is this? I can't
even scratch the surface.

21
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,869
What's going on?

22
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,770
Who is she?

23
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,639
This is a thermometer...

24
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,580
It looks like the inside of this
is filled with liquid nitrogen.

25
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,612
So she's been frozen and preserved?

26
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:37,880
Preserved?

27
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:38,512
Ryuichi...

28
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,255
What should we do, Mr. Oishi?

29
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,224
Well, I really don't know...

30
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,526
Come on young man, you're the
tour conductor, aren't you?

31
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,601
But we've never had a
situation like this before...

32
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,728
Of course! This is the craziest
thing I've experienced in my life!

33
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,702
I demand a cancellation of this tour!

34
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,833
I don't want to be on
this creepy island anymore!

35
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,468
Call the boat to pick us up right now!

36
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,375
Okay, okay, we'll consider
canceling the tour, so...

37
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,574
Please wait!

38
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,742
I'm sorry to inform you, but...

39
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,787
...the radio is out of
order at the moment, so...

40
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,786
...we have no way of
contacting the outside world.

41
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,350
What?

42
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:19,691
In short, we have to wait for
the boat to pick us up tomorrow.

43
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,857
How could you do this to us?

44
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,398
Hey, stop it!

45
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,804
Are you saying that you're
scared of a woman in a capsule?

46
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,007
What?

47
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:34,702
Do you really think that
frozen lady can hurt us?

48
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,544
She's not going to hurt us.

49
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,150
It's impossible.

50
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,413
Damn!

51
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,248
I understand this is an
unexpected incident...

52
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,724
...but we'll make
sure that you are safe.

53
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,796
So we would like you to continue
the tour. Is it okay with everybody?

54
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,226
I guess we don't have
any other choice...

55
00:33:55,833 --> 00:34:00,202
But I can't believe I have to spend
a night with a hot-headed jerk.

56
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,999
What did you say?

57
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,669
Cut it out! Now is
not the time to fight!

58
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,868
You better thank him.

59
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,273
We appreciate everyone's cooperation.

60
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,816
Also, don't come back to this
hospital until the police arrive.

61
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,229
Emi...

62
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,903
Is something wrong?

63
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,168
Oh no, nothing...

64
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,936
By the way, how did you find this place?

65
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:46,372
I don't know if you'll believe me,
but I felt like I was being called...

66
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,077
I felt like this girl was calling me.

67
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,187
I see...

68
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,714
I don't know why...

69
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,885
Why did I feel like she was calling me?

70
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:02,161
This is the first visit to this
island for you and Wakaba, right?

71
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,301
Yes, but what does that
have to do with anything?

72
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:08,696
No meaning. I was just curious.

73
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,847
What are you doing here?

74
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,540
Everybody is waiting for you outside!

75
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,550
Sorry, I'm coming...

76
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,964
Is something wrong, Shoko?

77
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,697
Um...

78
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,702
Can I walk with you?

79
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,537
Yes, sure...

80
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:46,975
Thank you.

81
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,377
Ryuichi, what should we do next?

82
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,044
Oh...

83
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,084
Of course, we'll look
for the rest, right?

84
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:59,155
Wakaba, let's look for more chapters on
the beach before it gets dark.

85
00:35:59,290 --> 00:35:59,779
Yeah!

86
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,490
Ryuichi...

87
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:08,495
Since I saw that naked woman in
there, I've been feeling horny...

88
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:12,993
Will you punish me like before?

89
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:16,263
Okay, I'll punish you
as much as you want.

90
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,536
I found it!

91
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,072
Where is Ryuichi?

92
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,727
Is my dick tasty, Hiromi?

93
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:48,371
Yes, your dick tastes so good.

94
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:52,602
Then why don't you suck
it until milk comes out?

95
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:58,873
Yes, please let me
taste your come, Ryuichi.

96
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,417
I'm coming, Hiromi...

97
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:21,997
You're so good at sucking,
you deserve a reward.

98
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:26,902
I want your dick inside of me.

99
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:31,843
Okay, I'll let your
pussy taste my dick, then.

100
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:40,620
If you scream like that,
Shoko and Takashi will hear us.

101
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,089
But I can't help it.

102
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,219
So I'd better pull
my dick out then, huh?

103
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,194
No!

104
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:51,700
I want you to fuck
me as hard as you can!

105
00:37:55,172 --> 00:38:00,269
Please harder! I'll go crazy!

106
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:15,188
Ryuichi, please, can I come?

107
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,318
Not yet, Hiromi...

108
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,086
Oh please...

109
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,638
I can't hold anymore...

110
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,110
I'm coming...

111
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,647
I'm coming!

112
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,959
Hiromi, you came without my
permission.

113
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,061
You are a bad girl.

114
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,997
You need to be punished harder.

115
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,227
Yes, please, I need more punishment...

116
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,634
Your pussy is so tight, Hiromi!

117
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:16,650
Yes, Ryuichi, please fuck me hard!

118
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,488
Ryuichi, I'm coming again...

119
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,594
No Hiromi, not yet...

120
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,525
But I can't hold it, I'm coming...

121
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,458
I'm coming!

122
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,673
It was your fault that they found here.

123
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,840
I'll have to punish you for that.

124
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,584
Ryuichi!

125
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,919
Where have you been?

126
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,318
I've been looking for
the rest of the chapters.

127
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,092
Oh, sorry.

128
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,958
It looks like you really believe that
your wish will come true when you...

129
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:06,330
...collect the 1 5 chapters and
offer them to Kotodama shrine, huh?

130
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,530
That's right! My wish
will really come true!

131
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,205
Did you hear that?

132
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,366
What is your wish, Shoko?

133
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,145
Me? Well...

134
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,109
What? What's your wish?

135
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,350
Wakaba! You don't need to know!

136
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,249
Umm!

137
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:32,053
I wish there were more flowers
or trees on this island...

138
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,122
That's true.

139
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,535
That's building 1 8,
where you used to live...

140
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:47,740
We may have passed by
each other 8 years ago.

141
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:48,936
Yeah.

142
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,844
I'm sure I've seen
this building before...

143
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,147
...but where?

144
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,152
Ryuichi.

145
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:02,624
Why are we standing
here? Let's go inside!

146
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,087
Okay, but don't jump on me like that!

147
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,388
Wakaba, you're always so cheerful.

148
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,333
Maybe Takashi likes a
cheerful girl like her.

149
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,441
This is the room I used to live in...

150
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:24,975
And the author of the story, Yutaka
Mizuhara, used to live next door.

151
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,443
What happened, Wakaba?

152
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,984
Look!

153
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,583
We finally found a plant on this island!

154
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,782
And this is really big!

155
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:35,686
What's this?

156
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,986
This is Ron.

157
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,420
It's aloe, isn't it?

158
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,531
This aloe plant is named Ron!

159
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,997
Aloe named Ron?

160
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,767
This is actually aloe.

161
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,961
It's pretty big, too.

162
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,929
But how can it grow so well
without anyone taking care of it?

163
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:54,135
I'll bring some water for Ron.

164
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,571
Hey, Wakaba!

165
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,781
It's getting dark! Be careful!

166
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,446
What is she thinking?

167
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:01,977
Hey, we found another one.

168
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:02,949
All right!

169
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,351
We just have one more to go.

170
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,686
Wakaba will be glad, too.

171
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:11,918
By the way, what kind of
person was Yutaka Mizuhara?

172
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,031
I don't remember that much
because I was little, but...

173
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,258
...he used to play with
me. He was a nice person.

174
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,861
What do you think his wish was?

175
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:26,398
I think he wanted to protect
who was precious to him...

176
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,542
How do you know?

177
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,275
I don't know...

178
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:36,510
It's funny, you talk as if you
knew somebody you never met.

179
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:38,883
Yeah, it's funny...

180
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:45,587
Okay then, let's do our best to
get the last chapter for Wakaba!

181
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:46,727
Yes.

182
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,024
I'll go look for Wakaba.

183
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,934
Come on, Tomoko.

184
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,503
Please stop, Mr. Ito...

185
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,638
Is that Ito and Tomoko?

186
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,536
I'll bet Ito is trying to pick
a fight with Shinohara again.

187
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:06,408
It's kind of cold to call
me Mr. Ito, don't you think?

188
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:11,385
I guess I should expect it from
someone who dumped me for money.

189
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:15,016
Don't say it like that, Hiroki...

190
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:18,889
After my parents died,
I had no choice...

191
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:21,658
I had to pay off the debt...

192
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,999
Tomoko and Ito used to be engaged?

193
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,959
I don't want any excuses!

194
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,498
Suck my dick.

195
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,835
You used to love this...

196
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:42,412
For 8 years, I've been waiting
for the chance to see you alone.

197
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:44,788
Good...

198
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:48,221
The way you use your
tongue hasn't changed yet...

199
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,592
I'm coming, Tomoko!

200
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:56,130
You still swallow it
until the very last drop.

201
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,570
You know that you're still mine...

202
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,869
Your body wants me!

203
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:05,506
That's not true...

204
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:11,438
You can't live without having
something in your pussy.

205
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,781
Please, Hiroki...

206
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:18,982
If Shinohara caught us here...

207
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,414
Shut up!

208
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,958
You are mine!

209
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,607
I'll take you back from Shinohara!

210
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,870
Even if it means I have
to kill him, I will...

211
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,513
Water, water!

212
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:04,998
You called him too, didn't you?

213
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:06,291
Wakaba!

214
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,461
Wakaba!

215
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,971
Maybe she went back
to the hospital room...

216
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,511
Wakaba, I thought you came here.

217
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,113
Ryuichi...

218
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,389
Let's go. Everyone will get worried.

219
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,388
Okay.

220
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,563
That flashback again...

221
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,698
Who are you?

222
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,231
Do you know me?

223
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,008
My name is...

224
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,544
Akari Mitsuhashi...

225
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,439
Why do I know her name?

226
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,642
Ryuichi...

227
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,950
Hey Shoko, where is everyone?

228
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,589
They're still waiting
in Takashi's room...

229
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,626
I have something I want to tell you...

230
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,528
Wakaba, go back to Takashi's room
first!

231
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:10,998
Why?

232
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,831
You have to water Ron, right?

233
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,233
Boooo!

234
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,936
This must be about Takashi, right?

235
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,442
How did you know?

236
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,113
I can tell just by looking at you.

237
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:25,981
Oh yeah?

238
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,380
I'd never been in love my whole life...

239
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:36,019
Takashi was so kind and sweet to me.

240
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,420
And my heart starts
pounding when I'm with him...

241
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,698
I've never felt this way before...

242
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,694
I don't know what to do...

243
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,636
Why don't you confess
your feeling to Takashi?

244
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,401
I can't!

245
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:55,342
Hiromi said the same thing to
me, but I don't think I can...

246
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,208
I see. So you'll hide
behind Hiromi, huh?

247
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:03,143
I think all you need
is to have courage...

248
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,015
Ryuichi...

249
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,789
If you just sit and wait,
you'll never get anything...

250
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:08,955
Ryuichi...

251
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,485
I'm kidding!

252
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:14,162
As far as I know, he doesn't
have a girlfriend right now.

253
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:17,259
If you tell him how you feel,
he'll definitely accept it.

254
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:18,694
You think?

255
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:21,999
You just need a little courage.

256
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:22,503
Thank you...

257
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:51,096
It's your fault that
they found my doll...

258
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,740
You dropped it...

259
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:01,973
She didn't drop it when I
did the same thing to her.

260
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,305
Please let me try again!

261
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,821
Move on to the next step as we planned.

262
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,790
Kill anybody who is in our way.

263
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,520
Do you hear me?

264
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,161
You have to try again.

265
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,793
We'll do this until you can hold it in.

266
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,443
We did what we could do.
It's all up to Shoko now...

267
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,776
What are they doing?

268
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,077
Hey, tell me
what they're--

269
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,221
It's none of your business!

270
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,114
Takashi...

271
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:52,159
Well, I wanted to tell
you that I like you!

272
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,591
Thank you Shoko, I like you too.

273
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,401
But I can't be your boyfriend.

274
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:05,598
There is a girl that I like...

275
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,237
It's one-sided love, but I
just can't give her up, so...

276
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,146
I'm sorry...

277
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,707
I see...

278
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,278
I understand...

279
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,383
Forget about what I said!

280
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:23,585
Shoko!

281
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:29,588
You guys told me to confess my
feelings and look what happened.

282
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:33,361
You all knew this would happen, right?

283
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,628
That's not true, Shoko!

284
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:39,330
We really care about
you, and that's why...

285
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,669
I don't want to hear it!

286
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:42,704
Shoko!

287
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:43,642
Shoko...

288
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,874
Maybe I hurt Shoko...

289
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,015
What's wrong, Emi?

290
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:00,153
Tomoko told me that she couldn't
find her husband, Mr. Shinohara.

291
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,425
So I was looking around and...

292
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,098
I'm scared!

293
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,867
Was he killed?

294
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:15,506
Probably...

295
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:17,539
Oh my god...

296
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,443
Serves him right!

297
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,147
That's not something you
say about someone who's dead!

298
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,911
This is terrible...

299
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,253
Who would do such a thing?

300
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,325
Let's untie him first...

301
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:35,258
Emi, what happened to your hand?

302
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,066
Oh this...

303
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,199
I fell and got injured earlier...

304
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,138
Let me untie him, then.

305
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:47,906
His skin is burnt...

306
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:52,107
It looks like a murderer
is loose on the island.

307
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,743
I don't know who could it be, but...

308
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,718
It's not me!

309
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,117
Do you have any proof?

310
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:03,349
Let's try to stick together from now on.

311
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:06,291
Oh my God, Shoko is alone now.

312
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:08,988
I'll look for her!

313
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,325
You all go back to our building.

314
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:25,373
I'm glad that I found you, Shoko...

315
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:26,947
Shoko?

316
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,415
Don't come here!

317
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:31,511
If you come closer, I'll jump!

318
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,815
How could you say such a thing?

319
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:40,027
I'm not cute like Hiromi
or cheerful like Wakaba...

320
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:44,600
I don't have the right to be in
love with someone or even live...

321
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,760
That's why Takashi doesn't like me!

322
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:49,695
But you are cute, Shoko...

323
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,807
Don't tell me lies!

324
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,473
I'm telling you the truth...

325
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:55,200
You don't know yourself...

326
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:59,146
Then Ryuichi, will
you have sex with me?

327
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:04,080
If you think I'm cute, you
can sleep with me, right?

328
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,686
Shoko...

329
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,789
Okay, I'll have sex with you.

330
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,018
But we'll do it my way.

331
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,462
No, I can't do this...

332
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,392
This is what you wanted for, right?

333
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:20,828
But I didn't know you
would tie me up like this...

334
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,733
A bad girl like you deserves
punishment!

335
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,809
This is for making everyone worried...

336
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:32,179
This is for thinking you're not cute...

337
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,680
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

338
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:42,321
Do you feel good when I spank you?

339
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,655
No, that's not true...

340
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,254
Don't lie to me. See?

341
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,229
Please, donit touch those...

342
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:56,163
Your nipples are already hard.
You must feel good, right? Shoko?

343
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,700
I can't tell you...

344
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:02,768
Okay, I have to spank you again, then.

345
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:08,047
I'll tell you, so please don't spank me.

346
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,482
I'll ask you again. Do you feel good?

347
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,047
Yes, I feel good...

348
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,418
I'll make you feel better.

349
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,526
Oh, please...

350
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:25,396
Please don't touch down there...

351
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,803
I can stop right now if you want me to.

352
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,072
Oh no...

353
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,173
What do you want me to do?

354
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:36,143
Please, touch it more...

355
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,110
Where do you want me to touch?

356
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:39,337
I can't say it.

357
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:45,352
Please touch my pussy.

358
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,319
Good...

359
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,252
Your pussy says that
you're feeling good...

360
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:55,024
You're a cute girl who can
be so sensual like this...

361
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,463
I am a cute girl...

362
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:00,800
Do you want to feel more?

363
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,730
I can't say such a thing...

364
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,642
Be honest, otherwise I'll stop it.

365
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:14,607
Please make me feel better.

366
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:22,147
I can feel you inside of me.

367
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,655
Shoko, I'm going to move, okay?

368
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,897
Please be gentle.

369
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:35,204
If you do it that hard,
my pussy will break...

370
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,438
Your dick is hitting my spot...

371
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:46,871
Ryuichi...

372
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:48,612
Ryuichi...

373
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,719
I can't take it anymore...

374
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,152
I'm...

375
00:54:56,226 --> 00:55:01,926
You're such a pretty girl who
can please a man like this...

376
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,859
So, be more confident, okay?

377
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,966
Thank you, Ryuichi...

378
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,739
There's a murder?

379
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:15,173
Let's hurry back. Everyone
must be worried about us.

380
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:16,436
Ryuichi!

381
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,270
Wakaba! What are you doing here?

382
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:21,509
You didn't come back, so
I came to look for you.

383
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,683
I told you not to go out alone!

384
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,118
I wasn't alone!

385
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,382
I was with Emi, but I lost her and...

386
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:29,683
Emi?

387
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:32,458
Is that Hiromi?

388
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,274
Shoko! I'm glad that you're okay!

389
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,601
Hiromi, I'm sorry to have worried you.

390
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:50,508
But what happened, Hiromi?

391
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,986
Tomoko and Oishi...

392
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,322
Are they...

393
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,987
Yes, they both are dead...

394
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,858
They were killed like Mr. Shinohara...

395
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:11,965
No...

396
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:15,896
Tomoko, why did you leave me?

397
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,006
Who could be doing this?

398
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:32,615
To be continued...
