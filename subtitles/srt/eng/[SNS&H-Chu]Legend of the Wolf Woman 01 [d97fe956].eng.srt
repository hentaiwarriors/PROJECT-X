1
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,298
Where is the hostage?

2
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,463
Good job.

3
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:22,462
Captain.

4
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:24,925
Don't say anything.

5
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:28,869
Nobody cares if a pedophile dies...

6
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,070
I heard that she was the
only child to her mother.

7
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,770
Oh, and she had a puppy.

8
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:40,239
Looks like C.S. I has arrived.

9
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:42,908
Linda!

10
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:48,717
Mary!

11
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,920
Mary's team is on this case, huh?

12
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,629
Take her to the scene.

13
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:54,229
Yes, sir.

14
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,133
I can't stand this!

15
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:02,362
Yeah, her mother seemed very upset.

16
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:06,575
Of course, her only child was murdered
because she wasn't watching her.

17
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:07,939
It's terrible.

18
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:10,811
What is this dog?

19
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:11,243
Oh...

20
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:14,116
It's the victim's dog.

21
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:17,119
The pervert used the
dog to trick the girl.

22
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:26,827
Shoot!

23
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,826
Oh no...

24
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:43,147
Legend of the Wolf Woman

25
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:45,115
Legend of the Wolf Woman
Part One

26
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:40,402
The Health Department announced
that...

27
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:43,405
...fifteen cases of the
dreadful disease were found...

28
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:45,270
...during the last week.

29
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:48,502
Vaccination is the most effective
way of preventing rabies.

30
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,447
All dog owners, please be aware.

31
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:53,482
Now, to the song...

32
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:02,190
Okay!

33
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,590
Are you ready, Mary?

34
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:07,186
Not yet, I need a couple more minutes!

35
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,764
Come on, we're just
going out for a drink.

36
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:13,702
What are you expecting?

37
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:15,666
It's not that simple for me.

38
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,971
You can say that because
you already have Brian...

39
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:22,743
...but what about me?

40
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:26,846
Okay, okay, take your time, Princess...

41
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:31,181
You always make fun of me like that!

42
00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:58,474
Hey Linda.

43
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:01,714
Brian!

44
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:04,447
I saw the news, I'm sorry...

45
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,218
Me, too.

46
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:13,592
The captain was bummed even
more, he thinks it was his fault.

47
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,263
Tough job, I guess.

48
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:18,797
But we need you in this town.

49
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:19,697
Cheer up!

50
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,934
You're right, I've got to move on.

51
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,539
That's the spirit.

52
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,709
My princess...

53
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:36,878
Master, please give
another drink to Mary.

54
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:39,550
Kata!

55
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,884
What's up? You're done for tonight?

56
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,325
Yeah, I had an early shift today.

57
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:48,927
Then why don't you join us?

58
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:50,463
Sure.

59
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:51,795
Well, then Linda...

60
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:58,164
Oh, forget about Linda.

61
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:00,936
We're going to party
until the sun comes up!

62
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,511
Hey Mary, you're hurting me!

63
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:06,948
We'll drink until the morning!

64
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:13,755
What are you doing?

65
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:15,049
Stop it!

66
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,726
Please be more gentle!

67
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:29,198
What a great view!

68
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:45,750
Hey!

69
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,758
Ouch!

70
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,520
H-Hey...

71
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:03,301
Please stop this, I'm serious!

72
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:08,171
I'll arrest you if you continue...

73
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:14,276
Brian, do you know what you're doing?

74
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,688
Do it by yourself...

75
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,914
You're already so wet...

76
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,554
You're lying!

77
00:07:58,128 --> 00:07:59,425
I'm not lying...

78
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:02,590
You're moving your ass on your own.

79
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,166
Because...

80
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:10,902
Now I'm going to use...

81
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,243
This one!

82
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,327
Hey, it hurts...

83
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:41,932
Don't lie!

84
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:45,464
Look how wet you are!

85
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:51,712
It's going in too deep...

86
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,019
No, you're kidding, right?

87
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,954
Please, no...

88
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:11,299
Bang!

89
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:16,270
The egg exploded after
she put it in the microwave.

90
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,102
Okay, okay, now you sit down...

91
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,411
Master, give her a glass of milk.

92
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:26,880
Sure...

93
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:30,383
Hm? Where is the milk?

94
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:44,022
Hey, the condom broke
because you were so rough.

95
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:48,593
You spilled milk all over the place.

96
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,629
Stop it!

97
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,046
Linda...

98
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:04,815
Look what you did to my uniform...

99
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:08,618
You like playing dress-up, huh?

100
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:10,859
No way!

101
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:14,927
Don't make it sound like
I'm some kind of pervert.

102
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,664
I just love you in uniform.

103
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,564
You look so cool and tough
in your SWAT uniform...

104
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:26,199
We're always together...

105
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:31,538
Master, give me another one!

106
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,748
Mary, you've had enough!

107
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,443
Linda will be worried about you!

108
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:41,047
Ha, Linda always treats me like a baby...

109
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:45,484
I bet she is having freaky
sex with Brian right now!

110
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,625
You too, Kata...

111
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:53,193
Me?

112
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:59,773
You have such a great
body, I'm so jealous of you.

113
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:03,635
What happened to you?

114
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:07,212
Oh, could you check the cut for me?

115
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,374
Sure.

116
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:10,486
I got bitten by a puppy.

117
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:11,678
Bitten by a puppy?

118
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,152
Did you go to the hospital?

119
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,120
No...

120
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:21,623
The doctors around here don't care
about someone like me anyway...

121
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:28,271
Let me see, I might have something...

122
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,971
Wow! Are they all medicines?

123
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:36,268
Yeah, I carry this bag with me all the
time, because of my job...

124
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:37,445
I see...

125
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:42,951
But it's not normal, right?

126
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:48,590
Well, maybe a little strange...

127
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:04,533
Look at the time! I have to take
Linda home, we've got work tomorrow!

128
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:44,004
Linda...

129
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,346
Mary...

130
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:56,087
Dad, Mom, everyone...

131
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,221
I feel hot...

132
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:40,162
Case!

133
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:42,265
What is it?

134
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,237
Are you sure this is from the
subject who was affected with rabies?

135
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:48,909
That's right.

136
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:52,209
It's a sample from the crazy
Chihuahua that bit a baby two days ago.

137
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:56,246
It became violent suddenly
and attacked the baby.

138
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,180
People had a hard time
separating it from the baby.

139
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:02,056
They ended up kicking
the dog to death...

140
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,486
...right on the spot...

141
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:05,594
I see...

142
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:07,788
So this is definitely from the dog...

143
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,399
What's wrong?

144
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,734
I don't know what to say...

145
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,097
This is not the lyssa virus.

146
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:16,938
What?

147
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,102
This is the official
sample of the lyssa virus...

148
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,745
It's from our database.

149
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:25,077
Right.

150
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:30,781
And this sample is from the poor
Chihuahua, taken right after its death...

151
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,016
They look similar...

152
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:34,145
Yeah...

153
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:37,087
Here is the third one.

154
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:41,652
It keeps changing form rapidly.

155
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:43,096
Exactly.

156
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,065
The symptoms are similar but the
third one is a totally different virus.

157
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:51,596
I've never seen a virus like this.

158
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:53,504
Me, neither...

159
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,272
Lady, is everything all right?

160
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:02,484
Did you get a cold? You're trembling.

161
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,382
It's hot...

162
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,817
I feel so hot...

163
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:10,420
Huh?

164
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:19,863
I don't have any money,
are you okay with that?

165
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,463
Come with me. I know a good spot...

166
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:37,253
You look damn delicious...

167
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,784
Take it easy, girl.

168
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:43,722
Come on now, I can't wait...

169
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,296
You're so impatient.

170
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:09,709
Yes! Yes!

171
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,557
I'm coming!

172
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:04,597
What is going on?

173
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:25,850
What the...

174
00:18:57,954 --> 00:19:01,014
I know that you're already
off the clock for today...

175
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:03,588
...but we have an emergency situation.

176
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:05,988
I need you to change back
to your uniforms again.

177
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:12,962
It happened about 3 o'clock yesterday
morning, and there are no witnesses.

178
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:19,041
The only clue so far is the way the
dogs and their owner were killed...

179
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:23,044
We will form several teams and
wait for further instructions.

180
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:25,376
Please stand by.

181
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:26,573
Dismissed!

182
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:36,552
Thanks for tonight.

183
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,989
I'll see you tomorrow, then...

184
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:51,538
What happened to you today, Kata?

185
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:55,906
Hey, why aren't you saying anything?

186
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:02,348
Manager, please sleep with me.

187
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:06,482
Why would I want to sleep
with a slut like you?

188
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,316
Stop it...

189
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:09,684
I said stop it!

190
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,426
Please, Manager...

191
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,599
I said stop!

192
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,494
Shit, now I'm wet...

193
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:40,247
Hey, if you really want me
to screw you, do what I say.

194
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:43,825
I'll let you have as
much fun as you want...

195
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:54,194
Hello.

196
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,794
Linda?

197
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:57,805
Me too...

198
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,808
I found something
strange about the sample.

199
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:04,071
You too?

200
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:08,779
I'm at the scene where
the incident took place...

201
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,710
Wow! It's so cool!

202
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,386
Cool, a real one!

203
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,855
Would you take a picture with us?

204
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:19,890
How did you get in here?

205
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,428
You shouldn't be here.

206
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:24,589
Isn't he dandy or what?

207
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,031
Yeah, totally!

208
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:27,926
Take pictures!

209
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:33,265
Would you take a picture with us,
Mister?

210
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:34,398
Yes!

211
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:35,511
Take a picture!

212
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,411
What's going on, Linda?

213
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,477
Linda? Hello?

214
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,512
Oh, I'm sorry, so what are you saying?

215
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:53,857
I said that we probably can't
make it to Tiger Eye tonight...

216
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,261
Oh, you must miss Kata.

217
00:21:58,668 --> 00:22:00,863
That's not true.

218
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:03,965
Don't treat me like I'm baby.

219
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:05,902
I'm sure Kata is...

220
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:10,006
Hello?

221
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,045
Is something wrong?

222
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:15,979
Linda, I'll call you back!

223
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:22,491
Klutz.

224
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,024
Man, this is incredible,
the rumors were true.

225
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,933
I've always wanted to try this.

226
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:10,067
It's so tight.

227
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,173
Please, give me more...

228
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:19,342
Sure baby. I'll give you more.

229
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:43,399
It's so tight!

230
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:34,654
It can't be...

231
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:50,001
I said, I want you to find Kata.

232
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:52,231
Calm down first...

233
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:53,908
I don't get it!

234
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,646
Kata is in serious trouble!

235
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,648
Please Linda!

236
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,211
I need to find Kata anyway, right?

237
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:09,291
Hurry! She's infected by the virus!

238
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:40,947
Damn it, what's going on?

239
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,905
Damn it, Kata...

240
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:08,947
She freaking bit me, that bitch!
