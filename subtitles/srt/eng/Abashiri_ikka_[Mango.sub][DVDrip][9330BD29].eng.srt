Hurry up and clean up the dead bodies.

93

What the hell?

95
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,160
That's right. The second son of the Abashiri Family is Naojiro.

96
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,030
His body is the ultimate armored cyborg, except for his brain.

97

Look at him! See his power!

98

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,620
It's too early to be surprised.

102

Next is the youngest son of the Abashiri Family, Kichiza.

103

My turn at last.

104
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,820
When Kichiza Abashiri takes off his mask...

105
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,720
somebody dies.

106
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,320
Shut up!

107
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,450
A genius with explosives, Kichiza Abashiri wears special clothes made of gunpowder-based fabric.

108
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,020
That means his clothes really are dynamite.

109
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,950
Freeze! If you move, you explode.

110
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,890
Money! Money! This is money!

111
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,400
Well, those three were just the opening act.

112
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:46,270
The sole heir to the Abashiri Death Attack, Kikunosuke Abashiri is the main event!

113
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,320
The power, the shape...

114
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,530
A single blow is lethal with this technique from the Eight Gods martial arts school...

115
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,830
the Seven-Headed God-Dragon!

116
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:15,100
Kikunosuke is the master of this ultimate martial art, which originated in Vishupulana, India.

117
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:25,740
In addition, for 18 generations, only males have been born to the Abashiri Family.

118
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,220
Now, the 18th generation has born our first female, Kikunosuke!

119
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,180
What?!

120
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,580
Kikunosuke is...?

121
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,720
Fe...fe...female?

122
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,650
Did you say female?

123
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,420
You know, dad. I thought something was funny.

124
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,190
You've been giving Kikunosuke a lot of special treatment.

125
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,530
Like, Kikunosuke's getting his own bedroom and shower...

126
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,460
We're half-brothers. We all have different origins.

127
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,400
But we always swore our bond would be stronger than iron. Why?

128
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,070
You tricked me for a long time.

129
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,510
Shut up! That was the rule!

130
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,150
The greatest secret of the Abashiri Family, kept hidden for 16 years...

131
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:05,250
Today, Kikunosuke's 16th birthday, is the day we shall break the seals.

132
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:11,560
That's right. Our family has committed far too many crimes.

133
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,630
The first Abashiri, Sword Killer Choujuro, killed and murdered over a million people.

134
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,100
Perhaps the curse on our family comes from their ghosts.

135
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,400
We have enduredm yet no female was been born into the Abashiris.

136
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,440
Now, in our 18th generation, a daughter, Kikunosuke, was born.

137
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:30,210
I don't know why I was born with this Abashiri birth mark on my back...

138
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,010
but it means I shall be the Abashiri's next master, with our family's fate in my hands.

139
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,490
As the rules stated, I pretended to be male until my breasts grew, and I've done a lot of evil.

140
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,720
But it's over, as of today.

141
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,960
On this day, having been released from the curse of an all male family, the Absashiri Family is normal at last!

142
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,800
That's what I'd like to say. However, as evil is everywhere in our society, and since we need money...

143
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,940
It's nothing personal, but I have to kill you.

144
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,810
I won't let you live just because you're a girl.

145
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,850
A beautiful woman is better than gold.

146
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,630
You're strong. That excites me.

147
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:35,140
A murdere like you belongs in the Abashiri Family. Girl's shouldn't have blood on their hands.

148
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,480
No!

149
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,910
Just because I was born an Abashiri, I was born a criminal with a reward on my head.

150
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:47,920
Evil, greedy men stalk me constantly. If I didn't kill them, they'd kill me.

151
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,420
It's a rotten world and it's going downhill.

152
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,930
I'd prefer to have been born a pretty young girl.

153
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,300
What bull shit.

154
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,610
That's right. Murder's no job for a pretty young girl...

155
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,740
but once she's 16, she must become a woman.

156
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,310
That was the will of her dear, dead mother.

157
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,650
Hear me, Kikunosuke! You, alone, must end this curse!

158
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,900
It's the last crime of the infamous
Abashiri Family, feared everywhere for their wickedness and cruelty!

159
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,030
Now the family's fate rest on this single bank robbery... but this is no simple hold up!

160
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,540
An army of police have surrounded the Abashiris...

161
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,240
and in the center of the battle, an earth-shaking revelation!

162
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,880
Who suspected that Kikunosuke was a girl? the secret was so well kept that even her own family didn't know!

163
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,620
But while God may be forgiving, people aren't.

164
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,750
Is there a future for the Abashiri Family?

165
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,660
If you touch it, even a little bit, it will explode.

166
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,360
Kikunosuke's the main performer here! You boys stay out of it!

167
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,030
Oh, man! I never realized Kikunosuke was a girl.

168
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,200
I feel it. I feel it.

169
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,040
A pretty girl should be kept naked and used as a pedestal.

170
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,870
Never seen a woman before, you bastard?

171
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,380
I see women all the time.

172
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,910
But I'm not familiar with pretty girls.

173
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,590
Oh, you have grown up breasts!

174
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,060
What are you looking at? Don't get so excited! You bastard!!

175
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:47,270
I've finally caught you, little mouse! How shall I cook you?

176
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,210
Bastard!

177
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,110
Don't even think about getting involved. He's already dug his own grave!

178
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,750
Having lived as a boy for so long...

179
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:00,550
Kikunosuke's female side has been pushed into the deepest part of her heart.

180
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,990
If somebody touches those long suppressed feelings...

181
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:11,900
the incredible energy unique to the female Abashiris will be released.

182
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,130
I really don't like men looking at me like this...

183
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,570
at all!

184
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,310
You're annoying me!

185
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,880
The final attack! An Abashiri 8 God attack! Fire God!!

186
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,600
Fight's over!

187
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,560
Goemon!

188
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,570
Yes, sir!

189
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,970
The prize is ours. Now let's escape!

190
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,070
There!

191
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:43,090
Listen carefully, Abashiri Family! you're already surrounded by our most powerful troops!

192
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,230
Cease struggling and surrender now.

193
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,460
Shoot!

194
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:18,420
Our power is stronger than yours. Stop this senseless struggling and die.

195
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:28,400
The strongest weapon in the world isn't an arrow, a gun, or a missile. It's money.

196
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,440
Money...

197
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,840
Don't touch it! All mine!

198
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,390
Do you want more?

199
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,800
We always do this and we never get rich. Damn!

200
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,850
[ I'm BAD! ]
They're not worth being afraid of!

201
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,250
They're not worth being afraid of!

202
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,780
This is the true face of the National Force troops.

203
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:32,680
<i>Hell! Paradice School</i>

204
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,680
And I put the flowers like this...

205
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,680
Yes! All finished! it looks delicious!

206
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,920
Wake up, everybody! A delicious breakfast is ready!

207
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,760
Hurry up or the lovely meal will become cold.

208
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,030
Hurry up and get ready, you shit heads!

209
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,930
I've got a feeling...

210
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,390
[ Gallantly ]

211
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,910
Beautiful breasts, the size of my paws. A beautiful butt, so nicely shaped!

212
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,870
Really!

213
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,440
Ah, what a waste!

214
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,350
Oh, you don't need to hide them...

215
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:30,590
Oh, first, she wears a shirt and what next?! What?

216
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,860
What the hell are you doing in there?

217
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,490
What? Well...

218
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,260
you over there, too.

219
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,000
What are you guys doing?

220
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,900
What were we doing? Nothing...

221
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,640
Oh, that was a sight for sore eyes! What a beauty!

222
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,950
He's right. it's tragedy to hide your beautiful breasts with that cloth...

223
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,390
and you can trust me to supply the lingerie!

224
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,420
Your breat size is... A cup and 70 centimeters. I've got that size.

225
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,630
Choose whichever you like!

226
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,530
Enough of this!

227
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,530
I'll never wear girl's underwear.

228
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,030
If you don't like women's underwear, how about swimsuits?

229
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,270
Exercise shorts are the best.

230
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,140
Negligees, too!

231
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,670
Stop that!

232
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,380
Biys! I envy you for having spied on your sister changing.

233
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,150
After all, I'm her father and I haven't done that yet!

234
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,210
What did you say?

235
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,880
B..Breakfast is ready, everybody!

236
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,090
Now everyone, there's a reason for bringing you together today to share a meal.

237
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:47,460
According to the new rules, we will now be a normal family and contribute to our world and its people.

238
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,860
Therefore, I shall tell you how to do this.

239
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,470
But first, a question before my announcement.

240
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,840
How do we get money?

241
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,570
Pilfer...

242
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,170
Swipe.

243
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,340
Steal.

244
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,070
There's no way except to kill someone and take it.

245
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:06,620
Idiots! I guess you don't understand, but once people used to work hard to earn money.

246
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:11,490
To do normal work, I think you need to go to school and improve you mind...

247
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,060
What I have just described is the right way to do things.

248
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,990
First of all, Kikunosuke! Go to school!

249
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,500
Go to school and learn to become a polished young lady.

250
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,930
I don't want to be polished.

251
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,600
I've already finished the entire application process for a school.

252
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,270
Kikunosuke's not a suitable name for a girl, so I enrolled you under the name "Reiko Shiratori". Try this on.

253
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,770
Wow, a school uniform!

254
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,680
Looks cute!

255
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,980
Show me my sweet daughter, Kikunosuke.

256
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,980
Female clothes don't look good on me...

257
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:47,060
I'm 16 years old and I've already killed 160 people.

258
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,990
My hands are too bloody to become a pretty girl!

259
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,660
If you don't kill, you'd be killed. That's the world's fault, not yours.

260
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,660
No way!

261
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,470
Idiot! Can't you listen to me?!

262
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,200
I think this looks good on you.

263
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,940
I'm happy if my sister becomes pretty. Aren't you guys?

264
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,510
Kiku, try it on.

265
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,480
Don't make fun of me.

266
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,630
You let Kikunosuke go to school, but what about us?

267
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,830
Biys and girls have the same rights.

268
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,100
You guys will do fine, somehow.

269
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,540
But Kiku... Kikunosuke is different from you.

270
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:55,620
Honey, I wonder how many people this baby, Kikunosuke, will have to kill to live her life...

271
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:03,230
I suppose it's all right to Abashiri men to kill, it's our way of life.

272
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,270
But a female can not live like a man.

273
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,170
The Abashiri family should never have had a daughter...

274
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:15,810
What a fate! I pity this child.

275
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,300
Bullshit! Dad decided school because he's got a thing for the uniforms!

276
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,350
Well, shit happens. I'm doing this for dad.

277
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,910
I guess I can play a high school girl for a while.

278
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,980
What?

279
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,950
A hidden microphone?!

280
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,790
I heard you, I heard you!!

281
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,230
In the Abashiri Family, if you say it once, you have to do it.

282
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,190
Do you promise?

283
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,970
I'm happy you said so.

284
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,570
I'm so happy you've promised.

285
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,570
The burden on my shoulders will vanish when you become a nice, normal girl.

286
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,810
I'll be able to meet my third dead wife in heaven without hesitation...

287
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:30,820
I'll tell her that Kiku grew up and became a beautiful girl who looked just like her.

288
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,220
Papa...

289
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:40,100
Well, Kikunosuke, let me get another good look.

290
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,130
Like this?

291
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,130
Like this?

292
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Oh, a chance!

293
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,640
There!!

294
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,140
Great chance! Oh, beautiful.

295
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,380
Excellent, I can trust you. You passed.

296
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,180
What do you mean?

297
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,590
I was wondering if you still had a little female left in your mind or not.

298
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,590
Liar! You're a pervert, Papa!

299
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:17,430
The motto of St. Paradice School is that an all-dormitory education focuses the growth of a well-behaved student.

300
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:26,210
Here, students are separated from the world's decay. With God's grace, we will nurture love, trust and intelligence.

301
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,040
That's our school policy.

302
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:35,520
Your name's Reiko Shiratori, right? I can see there are some blank columns on this application.

303
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:43,260
We decided it was all right. You'll start your dormitory life today.

304
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,160
Excuse me, but I've got to ask you something, Principal.

305
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,430
Maybe it's my imagination, but I smell blood from you.

306
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:59,340
Vice President, please take Miss Shiratori to the Ladies dormitory.

307
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,850
Oh, what a happy day!

308
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,650
The Paradice School is the best, a most famous school.

309
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,320
There's an old saying, "Among the crimson, things become red."

310
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,560
I'm sure that Kikunosuke will be a gorgeous woman when she graduates.

311
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,790
What's the matter? Drink more, drink, drink!!

312
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:23,030
I won't see Kikunosuke for three years... My heart hurts.

313
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:28,200
Are you in love with Kikunosuke? Well, I guess I could let you marry her.

314
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,040
Really?

315
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,770
Fuck no!

316
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,490
This is a new student, Miss Shiratori.

317
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,090
She'll be your roommate, so teach her everything.

318
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,190
Everything.

319
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,290
Yes, teacher.

320
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,930
It's nice to meet you. My name is Yukiko Shirane.

321
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,500
The outside world is dangerous so I'm locking the gate now.

322
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:07,010
Oh, I have to tell you that we get up at 6 am. Don't be late!

323
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,980
[ Teacher's Room ]

324
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,720
Did you see her? The new student's pretty cute.

325
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,450
But she looks like she was a hard case.

326
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,560
We have to help her get used to the atmosphere of Paradice High.

327
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,190
Now we'll have more fun...

328
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,330
Damn, what a cheap room! Just like home.

329
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,800
The girl's dormitories are all like this.

330
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,470
Are you really a girl?

331
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,940
Why? Do I look like a boy?

332
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,810
Oh, I'm sorry.

333
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,010
But, you introduced yourself like a guy. It's strange.

334
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,680
Unfortunately, I've been raised in a rather low-class family.

335
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,350
Iron bars on the window, too...

336
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:54,660
I guess you really are suitable for this school.

337
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:04,400
No, no, please. Help me!

338
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,870
In accordance with school rule #4...

339
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,110
the execution will now begin.

340
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,640
- Help me!
- Do you have any last words?

341
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,170
- Do you have any last words?

342
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,310
Mother, I wanted to go to a normal school!

343
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,590
Somebody was just killed. Damn! My nerves are shot.

344
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:37,570
Oh, no! No, I've had enough! Stop it!

345
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,940
Shit! A Special Meeting! They did this without any advance notice.

346
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,910
Hey, wake up, hurry! Special Meeting!

347
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,880
Miss Shiratori! Wake up! Hurry!

348
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,920
Shiratori? My name's Abashiri...

349
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,220
Miss Shiratori!

350
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,090
You'll be in really big trouble if you don't wake up!

351
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,620
Are all the students here, A-building?

352
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,430
I'm really sorry, but room #5, Miss Shiratori isn't here yet.

353
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,030
What? Did you say Shiratori?

354
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,330
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

355
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,270
You understand what will happen to you, right?

356
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:21,610
Which do you prefer, being beaten or raped?

357
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,180
Cut it out, old man.

358
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,550
What?!

359
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:30,590
If you do any more to her, I won't stand by quietly.

360
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,020
Who the hell is she?

361
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,220
She'll be killed!

362
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,390
Of course...

363
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,790
You're new, aren't you?

364
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,960
I guess you don't understand what kind of place this is.

365
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,970
You've said too much already, pervert.

366
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,600
What?!

367
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,870
You don't know who I am, do you? I'm Chidoro, they call me Bull-killer.

368
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,140
I'm a teacher here.

369
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:55,380
That's ridiculous! How can a psycho be a teacher here?

370
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,010
Bitch, I won't let you live any longer.

371
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,380
Don't contradict a teacher or you'll be killed!

372
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,580
Shut up! It's too late.

373
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,190
You'll pay for this! You die!!

374
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,690
Gain wealth by killing people! A bloody world!

375
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,860
There are many cruel criminals, but the Abashiri Family is the most fearsome of them all.

376
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:35,800
A beautiful girl named Kikunosuke is a miraculous flower of womanhood blossoming in this family of men.

377
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,670
To gain a pardon from God she has entered the prestigious St. Paradice academy.

378
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:46,640
But is God dead? Where is Buddha? A storm of violence envelops Kikunosuke once more.

379
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,810
Doesn Kikunosuke even have a future?

380
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,550
You've said too much already, pervert.

381
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,450
What?!

382
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,790
You don't know who I am, do you? I'm Chidoro, they call me Bull-killer.

383
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,060
I'm a teacher here.

384
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,560
That's ridiculous! How can a psycho be a teacher here?

385
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,830
Bitch, I won't let you live any longer.

386
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,900
Don't contradict a teacher...

387
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,400
You'll pay for this!

388
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:22,180
You escaped my deadly straight punch! I guess you're not like other girls.

389
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:27,120
You call that a deadly punch? It was so slow that a fly on your fist could die of boredom.

390
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,350
Bullshit!

391
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,690
Keep your elbow closer to your body, or you'll be leaving yourself open, old man.

392
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,530
What's the matteerm old man? The fight's just started.

393
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,430
You bitch!!

394
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,970
I'll kill you!

395
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,070
Can't you fight without grabbing some silly weapon?

396
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,370
Shut the fuck up!

397
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,610
She's found Chidoro's blind spot. Who is that girl?

398
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,020
What's wrng, old man? Is the fight over already?

399
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,060
Oops, don't move!

400
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,390
That's not a good angle to be looking at me from.

401
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:19,700
I can't believe she beat Chidoro!

402
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,840
She'll be in big trouble after this.

403
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,140
Now she's done it! Run!!

404
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,580
What? What's wrong with everybody?

405
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,690
There's an old saying, "If you know nothing, you get nothing."

406
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:42,090
Well, try to live long, new friend.

407
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:52,680
<i>Riot! A storm in the Paradice</i>

408
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:28,230
[ I'll be killed. Mother, I don't want to die. I want to go home. This place is like hell. ]

409
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:47,050
I'll kill her, I'll kill her! That bitch!

410
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,520
I was watching the fight, Professor Chidoro.

411
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,350
I can't believe you lost to a student.

412
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,620
Wait a second!

413
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,190
Please, please don't tell anyone about this! Please!!

414
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,090
No!

415
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,790
It's time for a faculty meeting.

416
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,000
Shut up and wait for the results of the meeting.

417
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,830
No, please don't.

418
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:13,110
Forget it! As a teacher you're supposed to be a model for our students, but you shamed yourself by losing a fight.

419
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:17,310
I doubt whether you can remain a teacher of Paradice High.

420
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,280
[ Study Hall ]

421
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,610
What you did was crazy!

422
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,180
We'll all be killed.

423
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,590
You'll bring us nothing but trouble!

424
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:32,760
What's wrong with this place? Are all the teachers crazy and all the students worthless?

425
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:39,260
You can say what you want, but you shouldn't have done anything, even if Yukiko was raped.

426
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,630
If you hadn't done something, we wouldn't be involved.

427
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,300
You bastard...

428
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,010
Wait a second. I don't want to fight against you. You're too strong.

429
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:57,550
But if you listen to the truth about Saint Paradice, you'll understand why we're all so scared.

430
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,820
Please...

431
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,830
Please, help me!! I won't fail again!

432
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:11,400
The assembled faculty has already decided.

433
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,070
You'd better start running, as fast as you can, okay? Or else you'll die right here.

434
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,710
Please, please.

435
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,480
Shut up!

436
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,910
Help me!

437
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,820
Who'll kill him?

438
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,080
I will!

439
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:41,390
This is no normal school. It may look like a proper school from the outside...

440
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:46,230
but once you enter this place, you'll never be able to leave again, just like in a prison.

441
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,270
And that's not all! We have two curricula: Cultural and Technical.

442
00:38:53,110 --> 00:39:01,410
Cultural is the same as you learn on other schools, but Technical is some really scary and bizarre stuff.

443
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:08,690
It's Murder 101, all different ways to kill people. This is a school for murderers.

444
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:17,730
Hundreds of new students are enrolled every spring, but only two or three graduate. Do you understand?

445
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,670
Everybody dies! The teachers are monsters.

446
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,540
I'll escape... escape!!

447
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,520
You're so close. You could have gotten away if you'd tried just a little harder.

448
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:54,630
Yes, all of the students arer killed. Students with low grades are used for target practice.

449
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:01,440
That means we're forced to kill our friends, using the techniques we're taught.

450
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,810
Stop it!

451
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:09,280
On top of that, some students are killed by teachers for disobedience, or for trying to escape this place.

452
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,950
Stop it!!

453
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,450
This place should be named Hell, not Paradice.

454
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,730
You did well, Professor Hitokui!

455
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,370
I couldn't let him live after his mistake.

456
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,340
This girl Shiratori, who won the fight with Chidoro...

457
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,640
seems to have a backbone.

458
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,870
It will be well worth killing her.

459
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,440
Yes, slowly and thoroughly...

460
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,520
The teacher you beat up was the weakest of them. I know they won't leave you alone.

461
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,260
New student and freshman scum Shiratori!

462
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,760
Report to the room of inner reflection immediately! Repeat, immediately!

463
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,100
We have nothing to do with this!!

464
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,930
No, don't go! This time you'll be killed!

465
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,910
Out of my way. I don't know what sort of monsters they are, but I can handle it.

466
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,820
[ Room of Inner Reflection ]

467
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:47,710
Good work! You're strong, but you're too impolite for a new student. I'd like you to reflect on yourslef.

468
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,650
Forget the reflection part, this place should be called the torture chamber.

469
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,290
We call it that, too.

470
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,590
You lice! I'll take you all out at once.

471
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,870
You're numb and you can't even talk, can you?

472
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,780
This point on your neck is called the "Bon no kubo", where all of your nerves meet.

473
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:22,280
When a needle is inserted there, anybody will be taken down, even a great big man.

474
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,890
Now you can't do anything. Well, well, you are a good looking girl.

475
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,830
It would be a waste to just hurt her.

476
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:47,270
Tastes good. Well, shall we start?

477
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,290
Your roommate's back.

478
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,830
Don't worry. She's still alive.

479
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:16,870
Tell her she should pray long and hard... and to be prepared to die at any moment.

480
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,870
Miss Shiratori!

481
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:33,490
Brother...

482
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,650
Wow!

483
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,690
Come to me, hurry!

484
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,530
Shut the hell up! You're too noisy, talking in your sleep.

485
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,130
I knew that was only a dream.

486
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:50,200
Mmmm... smells like squid...

487
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,270
I'm dreaming of her even when I'm awake...

488
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,880
I guess I fell on love with Kikunosuke!

489
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:01,180
I'd like to smell her, at least...

490
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,720
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale...

491
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,390
I said shut the fuck up, you bastard!!

492
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,470
My heart's full of pain, too much pain. I can't wait any more.

493
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,700
Kikunosuke, wait for me! Why don't you marry your loving brother?

494
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,640
It would be a waste just to hurt her...

495
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,250
Ouch!!

496
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:45,960
No, don't move. I wish I had some
sort of medicine. All I can do is to cool down the scar.

497
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:54,400
That guy stole my lips. That was my first kiss.

498
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,400
Shit! Ouch, ouch...

499
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,040
What? Why am I crying?

500
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,780
What?

501
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:12,780
Miss Shiratori, I was afraid when I first met you.

502
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:16,520
You were a strong fighter and I felt you were looking for blood...

503
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:22,360
But now I feel relieved. You're a normal girl.

504
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:31,940
That's he only good part of being normal. The feeling of wanting your first kiss to be with someone you love.

505
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:39,140
That's something special about being a girl. It's the only nice thing in this whole stupid world...

506
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,520
A charm of purifying impurity.

507
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,960
A charm of purifying impurity...

508
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,560
Miss Shiratori!

509
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:27,830
What are you doing?

510
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,660
No! You haven't gotten well yet.

511
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,470
Please, please get out of here, somehow.

512
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,000
I saw a teacher spying on this room.

513
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,610
They're competing to see who gets to kill you first.

514
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,340
I guess it's okay to be killed someday.

515
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,350
You know these teachers are professional killers.

516
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,550
Maybe, maybe not.

517
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,850
Then why?

518
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,320
It's my nature.

519
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,120
Miss Shiratori!

520
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,920
No, don't die! I love you, Miss Shiratori!

521
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,490
It's strange, us both being girls, but it's true.

522
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:05,400
Please, please don't die!

523
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,270
How...?

524
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:23,520
How did you know? I changed
my voice, I changed my body right down to my skeleton.

525
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,420
I know my disguise was perfect. How...?

526
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:35,360
Smell! Yukiko smells like beautiful flowers. You stink like a dirty feral dog.

527
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:36,660
Die!

528
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:51,980
I've seen this martial art before. It's the most evil in the world, the Abashiri 8 God attack!

529
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:57,650
Only one person uses this attack... I see!

530
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:03,020
What a surprise! I didn't know Kikunosuke Abashiri was a girl.

531
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,190
You're worthy of being feared. You're a natural born killer!

532
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,300
Yukiko! Where's Yukiko!?

533
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:25,340
This is the reason I can't quit this school.

534
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,050
What a perk!

535
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:36,750
Shirane, with your lousy grades! Shiratori, who tried to protect you, is now writhing in her own blood.

536
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,490
She'll die believing you killed her, hating you from beyond the grave!

537
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,730
You can explain once you meet her on the other side...

538
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:50,270
but first, we have a few more things to do with you!

539
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,140
Hey!

540
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,800
No!

541
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,340
Bad news! He's dead! Professor Biniku's been killed!

542
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,010
What the hell?

543
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,780
It's true. And what's more, I discovered something even crazier!

544
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,650
What's that?

545
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:08,490
That new student, Shiratori, is really the arch-murderer Kikunosuke Abashiri!

546
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:11,290
Biniku wrote a message with his own blood on the floor.

547
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,590
If that's true, we can't take her lightly.

548
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:20,030
Now that we know she's Kikunosuke, it's all over.

549
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,240
Yukiko Shirane? I don't know.

550
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,850
I'd guess she's being assaulted by the teachers.

551
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,020
Shit! I can win if I fight them one by one...

552
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,360
but I don't know about a mass attack.

553
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:54,430
That's it, collect an army! They're students but they've learned the techniques of killing.

554
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,400
With an army, we can win.

555
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:05,110
Please. If we all fight together, we can defeat a group of less than 30 teachers.

556
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:10,750
You're full of it! You beat a teacher, but just one. Don't get too full of yourself.

557
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:13,220
Give up and go back to your room.

558
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,620
Women should just quiver in fear in a corner.

559
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,120
And I'm a woman, huh? Well I say you're male piece of crap.

560
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,860
Anyone who hasn't got the guts to help their companions is nothing but shit!

561
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,430
What did you say?

562
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,570
Bitch! What gives you the right to talk to us like that?

563
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:33,100
Wait! Wait a second. While we're wasting time like this, Yuki will be...

564
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:47,220
It's not that we don't like doing things like this... Are you ready?

565
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:48,720
Wait!

566
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:57,430
One, two, one, two, I'll surprise her while she's asleep!

567
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,600
How does Kikunosuke sleep?

568
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:03,400
She's very masculine, so only in underpants?

569
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:09,670
No, kikunosuke is fearless, so maybe naked?

570
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,640
Maybe she'll be lonely, sleeping alone...

571
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:18,680
so maybe she'll reach down and learn the joys of being a woman.

572
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,750
Your brother won't let you do that!

573
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:25,520
What?

574
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:33,530
Leader, I'm sorry. The honor of the first taste should be for you.

575
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,830
Idiot!

576
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,600
Stop playing with her!

577
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:42,940
If you have time for stupid games, use it to listen to her.

578
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,640
Are you joining me?

579
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:51,950
You'd better stop acting like a man. It's not proper for a girl.

580
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,320
Hey, everyone, it's time.

581
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,460
Like she said, we don't have to obey the teachers forever.

582
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:05,500
Tell all the students! Collect weapons! We'll fight together, all of us!

583
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:09,770
We'll rise together against this school at sunrise.

584
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:17,510
I understand that she's dangerous, therefore I approve of her elimination.

585
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,710
Yes, Principal.

586
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:21,810
Still, what a pity...

587
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,720
Yes, sir. She's pitiful.

588
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,380
Idiot!

589
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,390
I dind't mean that Abashiri was pitiful.

590
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:36,060
I said that all of you are pathetic, scared of a child.

591
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:43,870
Riot! The students are rioting and Abashiri's in charge!

592
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,570
What the hell?!

593
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:53,900
<i>The price of betrayal</i>

594
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:17,940
We can win now!! Now it's our turn to let them taste the fear of death.

595
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,780
We can get new students.

596
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:29,120
I can't let these live after they've disobeyed the teachers of Paradice High.

597
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,160
Kill them all.

598
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:43,470
[ We're waiting for you a the old school building. Let's see how much power you have. ]

599
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,970
Shit, too late! They've escaped into the ruins out back.

600
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,910
Boys! Wake up, wake up!!

601
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:52,480
Wake the fuck up!!

602
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,350
What did you do, father, you bastard!

603
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,820
Nao! I..I think I had Kikunosuke enter the most insane school I've ever heard of!

604
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:02,120
Where's Kichiza? Where's Goemon? Why aren't they here?

605
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,590
My sense of premonition has never failed.

606
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:07,490
Something horrible will happen at the Paradice School.

607
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,730
Kikunosuke's in danger!

608
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,600
We can't undo what we've done, now that we've come this far.

609
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,100
Well, what'll we do?

610
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,810
The line is too long.

611
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:26,780
We'll separate into small groups. Girls supporting the others, each group fighting individually. Am I clear?

612
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,880
Yes!!

613
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:33,790
You're a great commander, for a girl! You're not just a girl, are you?

614
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:37,120
Let's go!

615
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:47,500
I can climb this wall, no problems. Can't be a great pervert, otherwise.

616
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,600
Here!

617
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,740
Wow! Great!!

618
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,970
I'm glad I came all this way.

619
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,140
Who are you?

620
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,710
Just a pervert.

621
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,720
Please Mr. Pervert, hurry up and help me...

622
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,650
I can't do that. This is a special chance for me.

623
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,190
Hurry. Please, or Kikunosuke will be...

624
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,160
What? Kikunosuke?

625
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,560
Who are you? How did you get in here?

626
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,070
I thought today was the day for the PTA to visit.

627
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,470
I'm a brother of Miss Abashiri and would like to see her class...

628
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,970
What? You're Abashiri's brother?

629
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:30,810
Well then, I'll let you watch Kikunosuke's execution to your heart's content.

630
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:31,580
What?

631
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,550
What's wrong?

632
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:38,250
Nothing. Now we've got more bait for the trap.

633
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:42,090
This is group 2. We haven't come across the enemy.

634
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,060
We're heading to point #2.

635
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:48,530
The enemy!!

636
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,760
I've been waiting for you kids. Welcome to hell.

637
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,510
Do you really think students can win against teachers?

638
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,080
It's strated! Everybody's going to be killed...

639
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,580
Shhh! Don't make any noise!

640
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,320
Something sneaking up on us, but I can't see it...

641
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:13,790
Where is it?

642
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:19,690
I don't want to die!

643
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,830
Don't get separated from us!

644
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,810
You're a pretty good fighter, the rumors were right.

645
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,850
I'm "Mademoiselle Honey". Everybody at Paradice High calls me that.

646
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:42,850
I didn't know there were female teachers in this school.

647
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,220
Answer me. Where's Yuki?

648
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:50,920
Don't worry. She's around here somewhere, along with another lure.

649
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,690
But I guess that's not really necessary, since you're going to die right here.

650
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:57,200
From where...

651
00:56:59,070 --> 00:56:59,630
What speed!

652
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:04,540
Are you a master of the Abashiri 8 God martial arts?

653
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,340
You don't look tough enough.

654
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:09,710
The wounds from yesterday are still painful...

655
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,380
Finally, recognition dawns.

656
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,850
This is the smell of sweet honey, which makes girls more girlish.

657
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,250
You'll soon see its effects.

658
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:24,360
How are you feeling? Don't you feel something mysterious?

659
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:30,430
Sweet, painful and more... I'll guide you to the pleasures of being a woman!

660
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,570
Well, well, you've become so sensitive...

661
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:38,870
Don't you have any inclination to masochism?

662
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,110
Escaping me is futile!

663
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:52,550
Bloodlust has eneveloped this whole school. I can hear faint screaming...

664
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:56,760
I knew it, something really dreadful has been happening here.

665
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,990
Looks like it.

666
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,860
Kikunosuke is the most important person in the Abashiri Family.

667
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:02,960
I won't let her die!!

668
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,470
You can't get away from me. Do you know why I'm called Honey?

669
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,530
Let me show you why...

670
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,970
What sweet honey invites instant death?

671
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,310
What is the taste of this solution, which dissolves all?

672
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,150
Dissolve into nothingness!!

673
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:25,250
You can take your clothes off one piece at a time, just like that.

674
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:29,250
The game is over. Now, you die.

675
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:31,020
I've got to get closer to her to win!

676
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,040
I don't like to brag, but I'e got the best footwork in Paradice High.

677
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,840
You can't win.

678
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,040
Prepare yourself!

679
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,040
Die!

680
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:02,120
Honey! My honey, on my face!!

681
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,560
My face!

682
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,630
I can't believe it took so long to finish off just one teacher...

683
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,410
What's the matter? Come on, attack me.

684
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:23,380
That's what you came here for, right?

685
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,580
I'm scared! Mother!!

686
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:29,920
Mother...

687
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:39,690
Here you are, Mister Leader! You'd better surrender to protect yourself.

688
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:42,990
You've only half as many students as you started with.

689
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,400
I don't care. Students can be replaced.

690
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,640
Who are you?

691
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:55,840
I've cultivated these forces in secret. These seven are mine alone.

692
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,710
Uh.. my glasses.

693
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:05,820
You can't teach at Paradice High if you can't dodge a knife.

694
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,220
Uh! Where?!

695
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:11,690
Leader!

696
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:17,830
You're the cruelest of all teh teachers.

697
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:21,530
You laughed strangely every time you killed a student.

698
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:24,870
Can you laugh like that now?

699
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,870
If you laugh, I'll let you go.

700
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,680
You asshole!

701
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:39,320
Besides that, they are nothing. If we kill the Principal, they'll betray the school and join our side immediately.

702
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:52,400
I guess tehre are a lot of people who want to die in this school.

703
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,240
Hold it! It's pointless to attack that man...

704
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,140
no matter what your technique! He's Daemon Abashiri!

705
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:03,170
Daemon Abashiri!!

706
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:07,910
I could never forget that voice. Danjuro Namakubi, right?

707
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:08,850
Yes, it is I.

708
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,480
This is the third time we've fought, isn't it?

709
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:13,920
And there shall not be a fourth.

710
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:18,290
What bullshit! Stop babbling, old man!

711
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:21,930
Stop, Nao! You're no match for that one!

712
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,040
What the hell is this?

713
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,810
My body's becoming numb.

714
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,310
Naojiro!

715
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:50,990
I found out that the Abashiri Family did this. Just two of them did all this!

716
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,460
They're too strong... like monsters!

717
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:55,930
But why are the Abashiris here?

718
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,630
It's Kikunosuke, the one we knew as Shiratori!

719
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:00,530
She's the Abashiri's daughter.

720
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:05,670
Then, we'll have to fight the Abashiri Family too.

721
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:09,040
They're worse than the teachers.

722
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,940
Don't worry. I found some good hostages for the battle.

723
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:16,920
I see. There's no better way to use them.

724
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:21,220
It's strange. I haven't seen any teachers for a while.

725
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,590
It's too quiet...

726
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,290
Hold it, Kikunosuke! It's not necessary to fight any longer.

727
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,260
How the hell do you know that name?

728
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:35,700
Your family came and helped us. The outcome of the battle has been decided.

729
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,840
We won. Let's go!

730
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,440
Everybody's waiting to see you in the forest.

731
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,780
Naojiro!

732
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,780
How about the power of my hair?

733
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:57,120
Danjuro, how did you get that ability? How do you keep so young?

734
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:01,160
Evil. I sold my soul to Evil.

735
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,160
Maybe you'll meet this Evil in hell!

736
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,100
Yuki! Brother!

737
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:10,800
Kikunosuke It's a trick! We've all been tricked!

738
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,700
What?! Where's my father?

739
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:15,470
He's still fighting in the forest.

740
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,150
I'm strong, but I don't want to fight those monsters.

741
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:23,180
I'm hoping Father Abashiri and the Principal will kill each other.

742
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,020
You bastrad! You have a hidden agenda don't you?

743
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:29,890
They intended to take over the school from the beginning.

744
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:35,090
She's right. I'll be the Principal and these seven will teach.

745
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:37,400
I won't let you get away with this.

746
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:43,570
No, don't move! If you move, these two will die.

747
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,840
You bastard...

748
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:50,080
We're getting a little bored waiting for the Principal and the Abashiri to finish fighting.

749
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,040
Why don't you dance naked for us?

750
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:55,650
If you don't want to dance, I can make this one strip.

751
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:58,580
Animals! If you want to see it that bad, I'll show it to you!

752
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,730
Come on! You'll die tasting the fear of death.

753
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,740
What's teh matter, big-talker?

754
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:22,710
Show us your pink nipples!

755
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:26,140
Damn...

756
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:30,320
Why are these things stuck on my chest?!

757
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:33,390
Don't tease us any longer. Hey, hey!

758
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:36,590
Help her out!

759
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:45,760
Danjuro! Do you think you can kill me with this tiny electric attack?

760
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:51,040
It was as I expected, Daemon! But I wonder if you will be able to survive the next one.

761
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,010
The 1,000,000 volt attack won't leave even a piece of fried bone.

762
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,840
You ought to just give up, then we won't hurt you.

763
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,580
Take her clothes off, starting from the bottom.

764
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:06,180
I don't care about me. Stand up and fight, Kikunosuke!

765
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:10,060
What a nice ass!

766
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,520
No! Stop!!

767
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:20,900
I've got it. I've found the source of your strength!

768
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,700
If you're found my secret, it's time for you to die!

769
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,740
I don't want to die! Help me!

770
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:30,140
You, monster! Start writing your own eulogy.

771
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:34,610
She said stop! I guess there's some feminity left in you.

772
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:35,650
Stop it!

773
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:41,050
Wow! I'll get to see something exciting soon!

774
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:43,450
Do it!

775
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,330
Principal!!

776
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:55,030
Help me! He'll kill me!

777
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:02,870
There you are, Abashiri!

778
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,380
Papa!

779
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,180
Kikunosuke!

780
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:11,880
Shit!

781
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:21,730
You fuck!

782
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:28,130
Don't mover, Abashiri! If you move, your daughter will end up like that.

783
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,670
All right, listen carefully.

784
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:40,040
I ought to be suitable to become the new Principal.

785
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:41,810
You've got no objections, do you?

786
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:46,890
I guess you'll agree, since none of you could oppose me, anyway.

787
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:48,490
What good boys and girls!

788
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:54,590
We shall execute the Abashiri Family at the inauguration feast for the new Principal!

789
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,200
What's the matter?

790
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:09,740
Here I am, the last member of the Abashiri Family!

791
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:12,640
Explosives genius, Kichiza Abashiri!

792
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,610
What bullshit!

793
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:14,950
Do you want to die that badly?

794
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:30,200
Does it hurt? Are you in pain?

795
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:32,060
I won't kill you quickly.

796
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,130
The main event..

797
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,730
always belongs to Kikunosuke Abashiri.

798
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,610
Gang Leader! I won't have mercy!

799
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,410
Afraid of fighting without weapons?

800
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,580
Here's your weapon!

801
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:50,350
Shit.

802
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,630
I can't move!

803
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,230
Here you go!

804
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:12,500
The most deadly martial art, the Abashiri 8 God attack, handed down to only one child from our ancestors.

805
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,270
I don't even have to touch you.

806
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:19,840
When the God mark appears on Kikunosuke's back..

807
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,980
it's time for someone to go to hell!

808
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:29,190
It's all my fault! Please help me!

809
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,020
Useless excuses!

810
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:36,390
The pain you feel now is the pain of my companions!

811
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,330
And the next one is for Yukiko!!

812
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:57,980
Leader and his seven goons are dead! There's no one left to kill you.

813
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,150
You're free!

814
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:11,800
Ah, Kiku. We killed a lot of people again...

815
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:15,470
I..I don't want to kill any more.

816
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:19,170
I know, I understand. Don't give up on your life!

817
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:24,640
I'm sure that someday this world will become one in which you can live happily as a normal woman.

818
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:29,150
I don't care what you're doing, but stop using my head as a footstop, you no good father!

819
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:35,120
Let's go! Look at that, Kiku! What a beautiful sunrise!

820
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,220
What about us, Dad, you son of a bitch!?

821
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,460
Don't forget about us!

822
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,090
- Come back and fix me!

823
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,970
- Wait! Wait a second! Father!
- Come back and fix me!

824
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:54,500
- Help me! Father!!
- Come back and fix me!

825
01:09:55,570 --> 01:10:02,610
Time passes slowly, leaving certain distinct footprints...

826
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:12,120
Are you ready, Grandpa?

827
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,560
The Abashiri 8 God attack, passed down from our ancestors to only one child in the Abashiri family!

828
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:19,560
Kikunosuke's so strong!

829
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:22,700
Oh, no. You mustn't be mean to your Grandfather.

830
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,340
No, no. I was just practicing my technique!

831
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:30,580
Mommy... Why is my name and your name the same?

832
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:35,480
It's a secret, isn't it, Grand-Papa?

833
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,720
Yes, it's a secret.

834
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:42,020
The peaceful scene of which Daemon had dreamed is here.

835
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:48,160
A dream? Yes, this moment may have been but a fleeting dream.

836
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:51,560
Even so, it's enough for me, thinks Daemon.

837
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:55,500
For now, at least, his time of satisfaction has come.

838
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:00,340
[ THE END ]

839
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:35,440
<i>The umbrella's colored red because of the red light</i>

840
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:41,780
<i>I gave it to you and ran away at the intersection</i>

841
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:48,380
<i>You're always so calm, even if something's happened</i>

842
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:53,850
<i>I wanted to hold you from behind</i>

843
01:11:57,830 --> 01:12:03,830
<i>I'm not gentle, with a smile on my face</i>

844
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:10,340
<i>I can't do anything for you and I'm puzzling</i>

845
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:16,680
<i>I won't love you if you don't extend your arms towards me</i>

846
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:26,520
<i>I like being a friend for now</i>
