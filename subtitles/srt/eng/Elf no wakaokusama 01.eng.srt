1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:03,970
I can't believe it!

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,572
Really, how could he choose
an elven girl?!

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,274
I bet she bewitched him
with her magic.

4
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,210
I think so too.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,976
The Gods won't allow
a thing like this.

6
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:31,994
Yes?

7
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,298
Milfa, are you ready yet?

8
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,804
Kenji!

9
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,086
You're beautiful, Milfa.

10
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,093
Have my parents come yet?

11
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,061
No...

12
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,128
I'm sorry...

13
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,120
Elves are prejudiced against humans,

14
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,360
but I wished they'd celebrate
our wedding.

15
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,873
It's the same for humans.

16
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,706
Never mind, I think they'll
understand us someday.

17
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,780
Oh no, my make up will come off.

18
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,408
I'll protect you from now on!

19
00:01:55,915 --> 00:02:01,820
The Elven Bride

20
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,234
How does it go?

21
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:22,105
Please treat me kindly
for the rest of my life.

22
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,846
You don't have to be so humble.

23
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,982
Oh, was I wrong?

24
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:33,214
Your grandmother taught me
the human traditions.

25
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,122
Yeah, she's old fashioned.

26
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:39,626
Just relax, Milfa.

27
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,127
But...

28
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,287
Right?

29
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:47,066
We have to follow tradition.

30
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,836
Maybe it's old fashioned,

31
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,031
but for two different races...

32
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,830
Don't talk...

33
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,318
Can I put it in now, Milfa?

34
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,649
Please...

35
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,956
It hurts!

36
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,034
I'm sorry. Are you alright?

37
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,876
This is strange.

38
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,845
There's enough lubrication,
so why is it so painful?

39
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,412
What are you doing, Kenji?

40
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,451
It's so tiny.

41
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,023
It's about half the size
of a human one.

42
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,325
Are all elves like this?

43
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,894
I think I'm normal.

44
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,555
Is there something wrong
with my body?

45
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,098
Is it because I'm an elf?

46
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:06,399
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

47
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,576
No, of course it's not.

48
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,779
If I had been born an elf,

49
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,976
we'd be together already.

50
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,783
Kenji...

51
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,121
It will be okay.

52
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,850
I'll do something.

53
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,359
There has to be something
in this world

54
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,662
that will successfully unite
a human and an elf.

55
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,664
Wait for me, Milfa.

56
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,401
I'll find it and bring it back,
no matter what.

57
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,460
Wait for me, Milfa!

58
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,377
It's a beautiful day.

59
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,971
Kenji... I wonder what he's doing?

60
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,443
Does he have food every day?

61
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,817
Is he in danger?

62
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,323
I hope he's alright.

63
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,595
I miss you, Kenji!

64
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,073
It's from Kenji!

65
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,475
To my lovely Milfa...

66
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,477
How are you doing?

67
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,680
I've finally found the harpy's nest.

68
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,618
I'll bring home the ultimate
lubrication, harpy ooze.

69
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,986
Wait for me...

70
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,188
I love you, Kenji.

71
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,247
Be careful, Honey.

72
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,178
I've finally found it,
the harpy's nest.

73
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,996
I heard they secrete harpy ooze,

74
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,831
but how will I get it?

75
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,333
Anyway, I have to catch it first,

76
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,358
and I don't want to be too rough.

77
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,662
No!

78
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,608
Another harpy? No, it's not!

79
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,670
Don't hurt the harpy!

80
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,005
Momma...

81
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,087
What the hell are you?!

82
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,952
I am a harpian.

83
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,392
Harpian?

84
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,860
I've never heard of those.

85
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,387
We live in secrecy.

86
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,890
Even if humans see us,
they think we're harpies.

87
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,439
Wait a sec, harpy ooze could be...

88
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,304
There it is.

89
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,881
That is our country.

90
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,111
Jugtrasi Castle!

91
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,491
Princess!

92
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,049
Hi, there.

93
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,364
Princess, is he for...

94
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,264
Yes, I am going to.

95
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,735
Wow! Let's celebrate!

96
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,136
Our princess will finally!

97
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,603
Excuse me.

98
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,040
We've got to tell every one!

99
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,575
Yeah, we'll be busy!

100
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,943
What the hell was that?

101
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,740
Never mind!

102
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,988
Why are there so many human males?

103
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,399
That's...

104
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:37,064
What is this? Why am I so horny?

105
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,478
Is it because of this smoke?

106
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,748
Wh... what's going on?

107
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,812
Hey, Princess, what is this?

108
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,427
Princess?!

109
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,587
Pyully...

110
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,030
My name is Pyully.

111
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,799
Please use it.

112
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,036
We harpians can't produce
offspring with each other.

113
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:09,599
Well we can, but they're
always harpies.

114
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,043
Harpies?

115
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,511
That's right.

116
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,480
Now I know why she told me
not to hurt the harpy.

117
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:20,710
We can only have more
harpians with humans.

118
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,124
The genetic system is
an ancient mystery.

119
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:30,496
So you kidnap human
males for mating?

120
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,530
Right!

121
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,794
But you're only...

122
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,108
Oh, her tongue's crawling around my...

123
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,517
She's good!

124
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,719
Hang on! Hang on, Kenji!

125
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,815
Don't disgrace your wife!

126
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,020
What a deadly attack.

127
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,067
Hold it, Pyully!

128
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,558
Yours is too tiny for...

129
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,029
Unbelievable! It went in easily,
with no friction!

130
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,711
Into such a small one...

131
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,578
Is this harpy ooze?

132
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,950
It's so smooth yet tight.  Ah fuck!

133
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,850
Please! Shoot inside me!

134
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,397
NO I CAN'T!

135
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,971
This way I'll never come!

136
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,439
Now I'll get the harpy ooze!

137
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:12,931
I won!

138
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,706
With this harpy ooze,
I can finally do it with Milfa.

139
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,942
Now I have to get back home!

140
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,433
I'll be back soon, Milfa!

141
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:33,586
A few months later, Pyully had triplets,
two girls and one boy.

142
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,852
You can make a girl pregnant with
just a drop of semen, you know!

143
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,430
Elven Bride
Elven Bride!

144
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,661
Elven Bride

145
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,578
You damn elf!

146
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,775
My mom said an elf isn't human!

147
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,351
You monster elf! Let's get out of here!

148
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,251
Hey, the elf girl is mad!

149
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,455
My Gods, why can't I be
friends with them?

150
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,285
Look, a female elf.

151
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,156
Whatta babe!

152
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,106
Well, may I have a squash
and a pumpkin?

153
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,266
No you can't!

154
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,312
I'll sell to you if you really insist,

155
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,280
but the price will be this much!

156
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,649
Three times more?!

157
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,954
Why is it so expensive?

158
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,390
You don't have to buy it
if don't want to.

159
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,690
Our disgusting food won't
please an elf, right?

160
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,622
No, I'll buy it!

161
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,399
Otherwise, I guess I'll
have to gather nuts.

162
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,773
I wish I had a chance to be
friends with a human.

163
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,638
Get out of my way!

164
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,913
Get out of my way, elf!
Or I'll crush you!

165
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,024
Hey Gordon! Stop, stop now!

166
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,324
The children!

167
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:34,933
Spirits of the Earth, I summon you!
Please come to me!

168
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,879
Hurry, run away!

169
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,209
Milfa, I'm home!

170
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,403
Honey!

171
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:21,186
I've finally acquired the
mysterious harpy ooze.

172
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,388
Oh, my!

173
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,323
Let's go home and try it.

174
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,491
Wow!

175
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,356
Hi-ho, Silver!

176
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,438
My hydra...

177
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,963
What about your hydra?!
Shut the fuck up!

178
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,520
Yam, Seaweed, and Green Onion
dressed with Soup Stock

179
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,055
Super Power Drink
Whole Grain Rice

180
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,723
Stir fry of Garlic and Bacon
Turtle Soup Fresh Egg

181
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,951
Blast off!

182
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:04,096
What a lot of nutrition!

183
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,098
Oh, can you tell?

184
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:10,102
Well, I thought you'd
need more energy.

185
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,036
Oh...

186
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,438
I'm embarrassed!

187
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:16,067
I've been thinking since then.

188
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,346
Although it's too big to
fit there, it might...

189
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,015
Well, we tried only one.

190
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,210
One? One what?

191
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:30,022
Well, you know, something
about the position...

192
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,990
Oh, you mean the different
positions for sex?!

193
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,527
Geez! He's just trying to
embarrass me.

194
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,630
Yeah, I think we should try
various positions.

195
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,631
Don't!

196
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,394
I'll finish this first!

197
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:48,207
There should be a position
that makes it easier.

198
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,043
Do you have any ideas?

199
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,847
No! I have no idea.

200
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,215
Crazy!

201
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,784
What? Didn't you think of anything?

202
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,220
Anyway, I was going to ask you...

203
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,585
Ask me what?

204
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,523
From the backside...

205
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,230
Alright, the back?

206
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,198
Let me try it!

207
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,468
Wait, Kenji, let me take a bath first.

208
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,937
No! I can't wait!

209
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,098
No problem, just leave it to me.

210
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,235
Can I try now?

211
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,514
Here I come...

212
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,583
Brace yourself...

213
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,918
Now...

214
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,120
The harpy ooze...

215
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,485
I'm ready!

216
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,586
It's getting in a bit.

217
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,066
It's no use, no further than that.

218
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,330
But a bit got in.

219
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,465
Honey...

220
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,269
Try some other ways too.

221
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,873
I got it!

222
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:41,384
I'll try until it's all the way in.

223
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,728
Milfa...

224
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,010
What?

225
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,171
It shrunk. Sorry.

226
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,950
Let's try again, next time
with a better aide.

227
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,417
Kenji...

228
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,414
It was so painful!

229
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,125
There, there...

230
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,593
If I force it, I could hurt her.

231
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,965
She looks better now.

232
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:43,749
But even harpy ooze didn't work.

233
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,418
I wish there was a way.

234
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,476
Kenji?

235
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,987
What's wrong?

236
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,291
Nothing...

237
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,398
These are big.

238
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,799
Honey?

239
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,769
They grew so big.

240
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,805
Yeah, this is rare for an elf.

241
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,365
They're so soft.

242
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,213
What?

243
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,316
Kenji is always so sweet to me.

244
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,978
I'll make an effort too.

245
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,922
Kenji, are my boobs that good?

246
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,724
Oh yeah!

247
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,826
Do you want to...

248
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,461
What did you say?

249
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,630
Do you want to...

250
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,466
With my boobs?

251
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,301
Do you mean...

252
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:40,138
I want to make you happy.

253
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:44,905
You're always good to me.
I want to do something for you.

254
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,139
Thank you, Gods!

255
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,516
Okay, sit on the edge.

256
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,676
Yeah!

257
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,689
He looks so happy.

258
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,147
This makes me so horny.

259
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,430
Is it that good, Honey?

260
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,966
Okay, let me use more friction.

261
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,671
Sooo goooood!

262
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,956
Oh, Kenji?!

263
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,150
Milfa!

264
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,917
Hurry up!

265
00:21:58,917 --> 00:21:59,975
Okay!

266
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,255
Keep watching.

267
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,023
Is this really enough?

268
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,325
I'm sure.

269
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,295
She's poor and sometimes
she only has nuts to eat.

270
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,059
How do you know such a thing?

271
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,477
The elf girl...

272
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,035
She's so beautiful.

273
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,254
He seems so satisfied.

274
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,756
It was embarrassing,

275
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,391
but I'm happy anyway!

276
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,759
Say, Milfa...

277
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,960
What?

278
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,496
Now you've created your
ultimate technique,

279
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,498
should I call it
"The Golden Boob Finish?"

280
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,965
Hey, knock it off!

281
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,738
If you say that, I won't do it again!

282
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,439
Just a second, Milfa!

283
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,374
What?!

284
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,341
Sorry...

285
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,684
What's up?

286
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,447
Hey, what's this?

287
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,030
Thank you, we're sorry.

288
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,528
Thank you too!

289
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,003
That's good.

290
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,208
I can make friends with
them gradually, can't I?

291
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,675
I think so.

292
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,320
So, we shouldn't fight.

293
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,185
Oh, I don't know!

294
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:42,481
Just by being there you make
my life wonderful

295
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:54,916
I'm so excited, please accept me

296
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:05,604
Let's be such a happy couple

297
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:13,712
That all the people in the world
will get jealous of us

298
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:17,182
Please love me forever

299
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,319
I trust you forever

300
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:28,827
I want to embrace you
like the rustling wind

301
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:32,697
I'll never leave you

302
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:36,301
We'll never change

303
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:46,939
The shining sky is all ours
