1
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,270
I-I am Faye the bounty hunter!

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,690
You are charged with a serious crime!

3
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,940
Your head belongs to me now!

4
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,570
Yummy...

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,450
I'll shoot you.

6
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,620
Since you broke your parole with the Galactic Police,

7
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,370
a citizen can shoot you with complete immunity!

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,210
You call that shooting?

9
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,840
You see, a gun works like this.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,260
Ah, I was in over my head!

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,970
As long as ya get it now, sweetie.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,810
Who the hell are you?

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,310
Stop it.

14
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,060
So you wanna get shot in the head too?

15
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,770
All I'm doing is telling you to stop it.

16
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,940
What?

17
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:35,920
BEYOND - Episode 2
The legend of Satan the Devil.

18
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,440
May I ask you a question?

19
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,440
Yeah.

20
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,110
Master, you said you had to rescue this girl,

21
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,980
and that's why you smashed that guy to pieces.

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,530
"Rescue"?

23
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,740
Does that perhaps fall under the concept
of "empathy" you spoke of the other day?

24
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,540
Rescuing someone in distress...

25
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,000
I felt it was the human thing to do.

26
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,250
You're not human, though, Master.

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,380
Good point.

28
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,130
I smashed that guy to pieces without
applying much strength at all.

29
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,010
You smashed him to atoms.

30
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,760
This appears to be more difficult than I expected.

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,510
She seems to be regaining consciousness.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,480
Are you okay?

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,620
Please let me call you "Teacher"!

34
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,450
"Teacher"?

35
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,700
Yes!

36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,120
That last attack move you did...

37
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,920
Please teach it to Faye-chan, sir!

38
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,540
Teach it to you, you say...

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,920
But why?

40
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,430
Actually, you see, I'm descended from
a long line of bounty hunters,

41
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,890
that started with my great-great-great-grandfather.

42
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,100
I'm so awkward and clumsy however
that I can't do anything right.

43
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,680
I wanna become stronger!

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,150
I understand how you feel, but I'm not sure if...

45
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,690
I'll tolerate any kind of strict regimen!

46
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,440
So please, pass some of your
skills to cute little Faye-chan!

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,740
This is a problem.

48
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,700
It's a simple thing to do, Master.

49
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,360
What?

50
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,370
You simply need to share your powers with her.

51
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,620
How do I do that?

52
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,620
Faye-san,

53
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,330
take off our clothes and lie down on the bed.

54
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,040
In order to receive Masters powers,
he must make love to you.

55
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,800
Wh-Wh-What?

56
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,720
Make love to me?

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,220
Oh my!

58
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,890
Teacher, please do your best!

59
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,810
Good. Master go ahead.

60
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,270
G-Go ahead? I don't think I'm
exactly ready for this, though.

61
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,650
If you wish to "rescue" her, though, I think
this falls under the same category.

62
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,650
Teacher!

63
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,320
Yes?

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,820
Don't hold yourself back.

65
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,030
Master?

66
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,790
So this is also a rescue?

67
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,160
Yes.

68
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,810
Oh, Teacher!

69
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,280
Please be gentle.

70
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,640
Please, don't mind me.

71
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,230
Right..

72
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,090
Um, can't you move a little further away from me?

73
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,630
Aw, come on, Teacher!

74
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:54,140
You gave me so much power that I'm
in a really good mood right now!

75
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,140
Yes, but the relationship between a teacher
and student should be much stricter.

76
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,110
I-I'm so sorry, Teacher!

77
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,520
Listen to me!

78
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,070
If you think that's the only way to become
stronger, you're sadly mistaken.

79
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,280
Yes!

80
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,950
True power lies in hard work!

81
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,370
Follow alongside me hopping like a bunny!

82
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,240
Yes, Teacher!

83
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,290
From here on, I won't go easy on you.

84
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,170
It's strict training!

85
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,090
Yes! So this is strict training, I see.

86
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,960
Faye-chan is doing her best!

87
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,760
I feel like a frog, however.

88
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,640
You are not a frog! You're a bunny!

89
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,590
Change at once!

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,390
Yes.

91
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,810
Not that kind of bunny, a rabbit!

92
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,680
Yes!

93
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,020
Please train me harder and
harder and harder, Teacher!

94
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,730
What frightening spirit she has.

95
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,200
Teacher! Faye-chan will work hard!

96
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,120
I wonder why?

97
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,080
When I see Faye-san and Master together,
I feel a strange sensation.

98
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,460
Hey, hey! Can't you keep going!?

99
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,300
Yes!

100
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,010
Where is he!? That virginity thief!

101
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,110
Found him!

102
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,740
Take this, Devil!

103
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,590
Cute.

104
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,830
Jump higher!

105
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,700
Yes, Teacher!

106
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,740
Shit!

107
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,240
I'm not letting this get to me!

108
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,840
The legend of the Black Angel?

109
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,960
Yes. Listening to Ren-chan's story reminded me of it.

110
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,720
It's a story from the Vineria Kingdom.

111
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,720
They have a legend about a black angel
who is very similar to you, Teacher.

112
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,100
Long ago,

113
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,640
when the kingdom was attacked by something evil,

114
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,190
a black angel came down to them from the sky.

115
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,310
The sight of the terrifying creature
deeply disturbed the citizens,

116
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,900
but then a beautiful girl dispelled
the peoples concerns.

117
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,450
After saving the people, the angel turned into
a beam of light and returned to the sky.

118
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,490
The end.

119
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,040
Faye-chan only knows about that much of the story.

120
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,130
Well if that angel really is me, that would be great.

121
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,510
He sounds like a really nice guy!

122
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,050
Master?

123
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,430
Teacher you saved Little Faye though,
so of course you're a good person.

124
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,230
Sorry for the wait, patron.

125
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,860
I wish to ask a question.

126
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,320
What's up with you? Your voice sounds strange.

127
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,490
Faye-chan and her friends wanna know more
about the legend of the Black Angel.

128
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,160
Where might we go to find some answers?

129
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,290
Ah! So that's why he's dressed like that.

130
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,960
If you want to know more about the
Black Angel legend, then look!

131
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,790
Go to that shrine over there.

132
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,070
O mighty Angel, please save Vineria!

133
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,950
Hey, young woman, why are you crying?

134
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,330
The Angel?

135
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,750
The Angel!

136
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,290
So you've returned to us at last!

137
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,790
I never lost faith in you!

138
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,960
"Returned"?

139
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,760
I've believed in you since I was a little child.

140
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,890
I believed that the Black Angel really existed,

141
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,300
and that he would protect us from harm!

142
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,970
Right now, our civilization faces a horrible crisis,

143
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,190
and in response, you've come to our aid!

144
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,650
Come, follow me, Black Angel!

145
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,400
Come with me to our palace!

146
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,280
Wah! But he's Faye-chan's Teacher!

147
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,200
My Teacher!

148
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,660
Here.

149
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,870
Your acolytes are welcome to come along as well.

150
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,080
Acolytes?

151
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,540
Faye-chan is his woman!

152
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,510
So this is your king?

153
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,050
Nice to meet you.

154
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,520
Umm, I mean, I'm not here to harm you.

155
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,890
Why are you frightened, Father?

156
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,850
This is the Black Angel of ancient legend!

157
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,070
He heard my prayer and answered
it with his holy return!

158
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,780
I see!

159
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,570
If Chime says so, there must be no mistake!

160
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,750
So you think I really am the actual
Black Angel of legend?

161
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,710
With you back on our side, we
will certainly win the war!

162
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,870
The war?

163
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,710
Father! Can we have a banquet celebration tonight?

164
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,380
Splendid, splendid.

165
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,300
Listen, subjects!

166
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,470
A banquet tonight! A banquet!

167
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,680
Oh, Teacher, you're so amazing!

168
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,470
Faye-chan is proud to be the woman
of such an amazing man!

169
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,060
Master do you suppose this too is "love"?

170
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,240
Were conducting a sacred banquet
today in honor of the Angel!

171
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,860
You must return from where you came!

172
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,530
Gimme a frickin' break.

173
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,330
Don't you have any idea who he really is?

174
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,540
He's the Black Angel of the Vineria Kingdom.

175
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,120
"Black Angel", you say?

176
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,210
Snap out of your fairytale!

177
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,210
Just look at him! He's the Dark
Devil, who destroys everything!

178
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,000
How dare you speak such foolishness!

179
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,720
Princess Chime says so, and she's never wrong!

180
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,720
But you can be wrong for believing her!

181
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,140
What's your problem?

182
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,890
Speaking ill of the Black Angel is the same
as speaking ill of Princess Chime!

183
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,850
Someone! Throw this intruder out of our kingdom!

184
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,500
Jeez!

185
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,960
Why are the people of this kingdom so clueless?

186
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,790
I guess my only choice is to strike
first before anyone's the wiser.

187
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,220
What the hell is this?

188
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,270
The sewer?

189
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,730
Dont give in, Eva!

190
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,440
Teacher, were in different rooms?

191
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,160
I've prepared a special room on
the third floor for the Angel.

192
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,490
His acolytes may stay in this room.

193
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,370
Really? You're no fun.

194
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,990
Very well.

195
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,370
So, Master, good night.

196
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,250
Ah, good night to you as well.

197
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,840
Angel, come this way.

198
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,420
I was hoping Teacher would make
love to me again tonight.

199
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,800
Faye-chan, how about I give you
a much nicer bed than that?

200
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,730
Aren't we there yet?

201
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,270
I don't want anyone to disturb us.

202
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,230
Disturb?

203
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,070
I'll explain later.

204
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,580
Where is he, where is he?

205
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,870
Looks like Princess Chime has made her decision.

206
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,750
Yeah.

207
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,170
This way, Angel.

208
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,680
The s-special room... Don't you
think its a little too far away.

209
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,140
Come, this way.

210
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,810
Princess Chime?

211
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,600
I ordered everyone to stay away from this room.

212
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,940
Why?

213
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,280
Angel, after you arrived here, I reached my decision.

214
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,820
Decision?

215
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,990
What kind of decision?

216
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,450
I don't want my beloved Veneria
to get entangled in this matter.

217
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,830
The fate of this kingdom is linked to my fate.

218
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,290
I still don't really get the situation here.

219
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,580
For now, just for tonight

220
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,540
please make love to me!

221
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,170
What did you just say?

222
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,800
I know it's odd for a woman to ask you this...

223
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,470
but for tonight please do my bidding
without asking any questions.

224
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,320
Angel... I've always wanted this to happen.

225
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,580
Come inside.

226
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,380
Hey!

227
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,210
Hey!

228
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,510
Hey!

229
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,220
Hey!

230
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,720
Please wake me up more gently. Huh?

231
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,100
Ms. Policewoman?

232
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,850
Don't "Ms. Policewoman'' me!

233
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,190
I'm sorry I left without thanking you properly.

234
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,730
I don't care about that!

235
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,780
I think I might know the answer but I'll ask anyway.

236
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,610
How do I go about killing you!?

237
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,830
By the way, do you know where Chime is?

238
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,120
The princess who was here with me...

239
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,870
That's what I want to talk to you about.

240
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,250
Clean out your ears and listen up.

241
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:11,710
Yes?

242
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,840
Good morning, Master.

243
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,890
Oh Teacher you're up really early.

244
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,930
Get ready to depart at once.

245
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,100
Where to?

246
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,350
I'll explain later.

247
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,600
Hurry.

248
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,400
Okay.

249
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,820
Here!

250
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,900
Whoa...

251
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,950
This kingdom is threatened by the Assyr Kingdom.

252
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,250
The prince of Assyr said he would invade this
country unless Princess Chime married him.

253
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,210
What a horrible story!

254
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,710
Faye-chan is really mad about it.

255
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,930
The king, unable to give up his beloved
daughter, was planning to refuse,

256
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,590
which would mean an all-out
war between the kingdoms.

257
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,970
But Assyr is strong.

258
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,680
If war broke out this kingdom
wouldn't stand a chance.

259
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,270
I understand.

260
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,060
So when Master appeared, he helped Chime
reach a decision about the wedding.

261
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,770
She believes that with Master
around, this kingdom is safe.

262
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,110
That's exactly right.

263
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,400
The princess just left on a ship for the enemy kingdom.

264
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,500
You're a man, aren't you!?

265
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,460
Take some responsibility for your actions!

266
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,890
I can't even help Chime.

267
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,680
How can I be the legendary Black Angel?

268
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,470
Oh, Teacher?

269
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,980
Maybe we could catch up with her ship if we left now?

270
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,640
Master! I know a way.

271
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,570
You have yet use teleportation.

272
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,110
That's right!

273
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,150
Teleportation!

274
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,360
How do I do it?

275
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,240
Tell me, please!

276
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,070
Place the feelings of the person
you wish to see in your heart.

277
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,280
Then you will fly to her side in an instant.

278
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,620
Good!

279
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,370
Then I'll go too.

280
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,920
Big Sis!

281
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,250
Ah, how dare they leave me all by myself!

282
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,670
What a little whiner you are.

283
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,380
Come with me.

284
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,700
Come, young lady, why are you crying?

285
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,580
Angel?

286
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,200
I've come to rescue you, Chime.

287
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,660
Let's go.

288
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,540
Yes!

289
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,210
Master? The point from which you teleported just
experienced an inter-dimensional power surge.

290
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,590
You're trapped inhere!

291
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,220
You think I care about that?

292
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,550
It's time to punish those who tried to
use this sweet lady to start a war!

293
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:11,010
Ren, you take Chime back to Vineria.

294
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,140
Yes, Master. Come, this way.

295
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,270
Please be careful.

296
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:22,110
Now, let's test these "powers" of mine
to see how far they stretch!

297
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,220
He killed them.

298
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,800
Now it's my fault.

299
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,900
How can I possibly thank you?

300
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,530
Thanks to you, Vineria has been saved.

301
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,030
Though I fear I can't control my own powers...

302
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,740
All's well that ends well.

303
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,580
Father, I have a favor to ask.

304
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,250
What is it Chime? Ask me anything.

305
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,500
I want to stay with the Angel.

306
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,510
When I met the Angel I understood it clearly.

307
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,760
Even a princess, such as myself tied to a kingdom...

308
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,180
has the right to love someone.

309
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,770
"Love", you say? Umm...

310
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,770
Very well said! You make your father proud!

311
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,810
You also say some pretty bold things, don't you?

312
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,120
Chime-chan, it's so cool that you're
getting married on a spaceship!

313
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,790
My beloved Angel says he wishes to depart
on a journey to retrieve his memories.

314
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,050
I want to do anything I can to help.

315
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,050
Chime...

316
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,760
And helping my Angel retrieve his
happiness is also my happiness.

317
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:18,640
Aw, Teacher! Please give Faye-chan
another training exercise!

318
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,230
Hey...

319
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,810
Master, I have a strange sensation.

320
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,820
Are these "feelings," you think?

321
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,320
Looks like you learned a lot Ren.

322
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,320
I still couldn't find my own answer, though.

323
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,450
I don't get it.

324
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,290
Didn't I tell you?

325
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,580
You're the Dark Devil.

326
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,580
You can only destroy and kill.

327
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,040
You're the most evil thing in the universe.

328
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,460
Ms. Policewoman? What are you doing here?

329
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,800
Oh, shut your mouth.
