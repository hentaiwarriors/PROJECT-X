00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:05,638
Masaki Asakura is the manager
of the pop group Twinkle.

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:11,838
He has fallen in love with Saori, the
daughter of his step-mother, Emiko.

3
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,347
Will Masaki be able to
protect his dear step-sister...

4
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:20,078
...from the evil conspiracies
surrounding the entertainment industry?

(YUNA SAOTOME)

7
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,856
I'm really sorry!
(YUNA SAOTOME)

8
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,132
It's because I wasn't
paying enough attention...

9
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,396
It's my fault you got injured like this.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,765
Oh, don't worry about it. It was my choice.

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,005
But I can't just...

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,203
What can I say? My
body moved on instinct.

13
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,709
Anyway, Saori is okay, right?

14
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,577
Aren't you glad?

15
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:59,388
Yeah... Thank you for saving
her. She's perfectly fine.

16
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,320
I really appreciate it.

17
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:04,960
A younger sister, huh?

18
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:06,257
Huh?

19
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,531
You're in love with Saori, aren't you?

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,802
Uh, well... that's...

21
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,231
You don't have to hide it. I can
tell just by how you reacted.

22
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,834
Anyway, you'd better be able
to protect her next time.

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,076
After all, you love Saori so
much that you came after us.

24
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,086
Well... that was a...

25
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,279
I did it in anger and...

26
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,420
I'm sorry. I've done something
terrible to you both.

27
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,995
I'll do anything, if you'll forgive me.

28
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,324
Anything?

29
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,492
Then...

30
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,031
<i>Will you make love to me?</i>

31
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,566
<i>What?</i>

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,708
<i>I want you to do it gently this time</i>.

33
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,243
<i>I want you to make love</i>
<i>to me just this once</i>.

34
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,115
<i>Sure. If that makes up</i>
<i>for the things I've done</i>.

35
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,555
<i>Thanks to you, I can see</i>
<i>things more clearly</i>...

36
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,723
<i>But I must admit, it was</i>
<i>a rough route you took</i>.

37
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,889
<i>I just had to work harder</i>.

38
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,361
<i>Thanks for making me realize that</i>.

39
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,273
<i>See ya!</i>

40
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,416
Erica.

41
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,646
May I have a moment of your time?

42
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:38,856
What do you need?

43
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:43,256
Masaki, remember the horrible
things you did to me the other day?

44
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,929
Y-yeah... I'm really sorry.
I really wasn't myself.

45
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,627
What are we going to do about
your overprotective sister complex?

46
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,502
Yeah, tell me about it.

47
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:01,841
There's something I want you
to do, to make it up to me.

48
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:09,251
<i>To be honest, I was in love with you</i>.

49
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:15,126
<i>But you only paid attention to Saori</i>.

50
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,227
<i>I was so jealous</i>.

51
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,298
<i>That's why I was being a bully</i>.

52
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,467
<i>But it's your fault too, you know!</i>

53
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,640
<i>So make it up to me</i>.

54
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,669
<i>This time, I want you to make love to me</i>.

55
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,137
<i>Sure</i>.

56
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:35,539
<i>Thank you</i>.

57
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,451
That was great, Masaki.

58
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,457
I'll remember this when I'm gone.

59
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,464
What did you just say?

60
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,192
Well...

61
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,471
So? What's going on?

62
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,402
Are you going to have
it all by the due date?

63
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,476
Yes, I'll definitely have it by then.

64
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:15,177
Well, just make sure you have
all one hundred million ready.

65
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:21,985
Rumor has it that your
talents are pretty promising.

66
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,129
It's only a hundred million. You should
be able to come up with it somehow.

67
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,659
We'll leave for now, but...

68
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,894
...you'd better have it next time.

69
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,078
Hey.

70
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,746
What's going on?

71
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:49,950
Your boss isn't returning our money.

72
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:56,022
So we came all the way here to collect it.

73
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,026
Anyway, ask your boss for more details.

74
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,104
As long as I get my money
back that's all I care about.

75
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,810
So, can you explain
what's going on, boss?

76
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,549
I was going to have to tell
you sooner or later, but...

77
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,856
...this company has a one
hundred million yen debt.

78
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,894
It's my husband's... Your father's debt.

79
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:35,263
The interest kept piling up, and now
it's reached the hundred million mark.

80
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,798
My father's?

81
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,867
Why haven't you told me
something this important until now?

82
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,571
I didn't know.

83
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,608
I found out when I had to
sign the inheritance papers.

84
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,744
Then it would have been better
to give up the inheritance.

85
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,682
But I made a promise to him.

86
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,791
I promised him that I would do my best
to see that his company succeeds.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,093
Then, what are you going to do about it?

88
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,671
Asakuro Production doesn't
have the money to pay back
one hundred million yen!

89
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,470
We'll be fine if Twinkle can
become regulars on that show.

90
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,671
Their CDs will sell and commercial
jobs will hopefully roll in.

91
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,512
And if they don't get the position?

92
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,483
If you're going to cry, please do it here.

93
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,729
You can't cry in front of
Saori and the others.

94
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,127
I know...

95
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,025
...but, for now...

96
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,410
This is terrible. I almost gave her a kiss!

97
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:37,851
Yes...

98
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,312
Thank you, Masaki.

99
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,218
You're always so kind,
even to a woman like me.

100
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,615
Huh?

101
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:51,156
I only had sex with you
because I was so lonely.

102
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:56,131
On top of that, I was fantasizing
about your father during it.

103
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,240
I kind of figured as much.

104
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,934
Huh?

105
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:08,504
But in a way it's great. My step-mother
is still in love with my father.

106
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,341
I think I would have been
sad if it was anyone else.

107
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,583
You're a fool.

108
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,483
<i>And there's something I need to tell you</i>.

109
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,657
<i>You're not alone</i>.

110
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,696
<i>You have Saori</i>.

111
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,096
<i>And, you have me</i>.

112
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,832
<i>We'll always be on your side</i>.

113
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:31,867
<i>Please don't forget that</i>.

114
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,131
Yes?

115
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,910
Saori, there's something I
need to talk to you about.

116
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,850
Welcome, glad you could come.

117
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,022
You're a beautiful girl,
just like your mother.

118
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,285
This will be fun.

119
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,072
Oh? Mother, have you seen Saori?

120
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,838
Saori is at Kijima's place right now.

121
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,310
What did you just say?
What are you thinking?

122
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,778
You're terrible! In the end, you're
only thinking about yourself!

123
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:28,820
Damn it! I'll take care of Saori! You
can't have her anymore! Good bye!

124
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,028
Hmm? What's wrong? Hurry
up and take off your clothes.

125
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:39,364
Do you not want the regular position?

126
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,903
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

127
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,907
What to do...

128
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,614
Your mother was happy to service me.

129
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,513
Huh? Mother did?

130
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,054
That's right. You mother was
quite skilled at what she did.

131
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,728
I'm sure she's fucked many different men.

132
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,195
She didn't...

133
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,958
You have the blood of a slut
running through your veins.

134
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,063
Come now, entertain me.

135
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:17,333
Or would you rather have me force you?

136
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,477
Please hold that thought, Mr. Kijima.

137
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:27,817
Mr. Kijima, I recommend our Lovely Ladies
rather than a scrawny woman like her.

138
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,423
Now ladies...

139
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,221
...give Mr. Kijima a taste of Heaven!

140
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:34,722
Yes!

141
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,825
How the hell do you
expect me to eat this!?

142
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,470
W-what are you...

143
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,666
Mr. Matsuoka.

144
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,041
You have made a terrible mistake.

145
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,209
I absolutely despise wasting food!

146
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,844
B-but...

147
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,149
True, the Lovely Ladies seem amazing.

148
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,251
So I'll let them make their debut. But...

00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,160
What the fuck are you doing Kibayashi?

154
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:14,506
Uhh... I was kind of, sort
of, thinking of joining in?

155
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,740
You fucker. What the hell are you thinking?

156
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:19,906
Um... Well...

157
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,745
I just wanted to try and get a
little something, for once...

158
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,117
You mother fucker.

159
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,090
Oh what a handsome guy!

160
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,183
Oh my! You said it sister!

161
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,925
I want the handsome with the glasses.

162
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,428
Then the grease hunk is all mine.

163
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,635
Yes? This is Asakura Production.

164
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,874
What? You've chosen our
girls for the position?

165
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,846
Yes. I understand. Thank you very much.

166
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,422
Yes? This is Asakura Production.

167
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,049
Oh, Yuna!

168
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,024
What? You're switching agencies?

169
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,020
You want to become an action star?

00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,660
Yes? This is Asakura Production.

Huh? You're going to become an actress?

173
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:21,797
But you can be one through us...

174
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,339
You've already decided?

175
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:26,473
Yes?

176
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,278
Saori?

177
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,016
What? You're not coming home anymore?

178
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,276
Good bye.

179
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,992
Glad you could come.

180
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,291
It's been rough for you, huh?

181
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:55,234
You finally got the 'Regulars'
position, and all your girls left you.

182
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:02,677
I'm all alone again.

183
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,613
They always leave me.

184
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,517
Do you know why Taizo died?

185
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,857
You were a pop star once.

186
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:20,293
There's a man who has
loved you since back then.

187
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,196
At first, he was only wishing
for your happiness...

188
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,770
...but then he started to
want you all for himself.

189
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,876
And he took your husband's life.

190
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,048
Knowing it wouldn't do anything...

191
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,982
I knew all along...

192
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,412
...that you gave the orders.

193
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:44,846
Then why?

194
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,056
Don't you hate me?

195
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:53,221
Even so, I have no choice
but to live for the both of us.

196
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,998
You're such a strong woman.

197
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,929
If I only had your strength
I would have taken you.

198
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:08,936
Although it wasn't any of my business,
I paid off your company's debt.

199
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:14,510
This is the only way I know to
express my love. Forgive me.

200
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:24,027
You're not alone. At least in
your heart, Taizo is there.

201
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,223
Forgive me.

202
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,192
I wish...

203
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:31,759
I was also...

204
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,697
...in your heart.

205
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,812
I'm sorry, Masaki.

206
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,477
It's all right. We were the
ones that were wrong.

207
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,345
You're the one that's right.

208
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,285
So, what do you want to do from now on?

209
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,184
I'm going to keep singing. For sure!

210
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,893
I'll write my own songs, and start
fresh with general auditions.

211
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,996
Okay then.

212
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,600
I'll fully back you. You just keep
doing what you think is right.

213
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:07,471
Okay!

214
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,009
And I have my first favor to ask you.

215
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,439
What is it?

216
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:20,351
Umm... I want you to make love to me.

217
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,088
I've been in love with you
since the first day we met.

218
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,490
Same goes for me.

219
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:29,460
Huh?

220
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,265
Masaki.

221
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,293
Is it all right if I take a shower with you?

222
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:42,898
Sure.

223
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,569
What's wrong Masaki?

224
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:53,642
Oh, I was just thinking
how beautiful you were.

225
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,818
I'm so embarrassed.

226
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,454
S-sorry.

227
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,390
That's so weird!

228
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,068
Wow. It ends up looking like this?

229
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,745
I can't help it. It's because
I saw your beautiful body.

230
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:23,476
Oh Masaki... you're embarrassing me!

231
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,580
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

232
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,185
You're so much prettier
than some pop star.

233
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,990
Um, Masaki? I'm a pop
star too, you know...

234
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,659
Oh yeah! That's right.

235
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:38,657
Sorry, my mistake.

236
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,422
Hmph! You dummy.

237
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:45,229
Anyway, I want to see your body more.

238
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:46,870
Nope!

239
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:03,418
It's so strange.

240
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:08,758
I was so afraid of Mr. Kijima's,
but I'm not afraid of yours.

241
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:13,455
It's not really helping me when you're
comparing me to an old geezer.

242
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,794
Was it shaped weird?

243
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,233
No, it wasn't that.

244
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:24,007
It didn't gross me out. I'm not
talking about how it looked.

245
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:25,736
Oh, I see.

246
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:31,779
On top of that, I've only seen yours
and Mr. Kijima's, so I really don't
know what a weird shape would be.

247
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,045
Then you're a...

248
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,689
Yes, it's my first time.

249
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,450
Oh, forget it!

250
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,360
Sorry Saori. It's my fault.

251
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,434
Let's make up.

252
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,401
Just forget it!

253
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,673
I was just nervous because I thought
I was going to make love to you.

254
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,435
It's like a dream come true.

255
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:57,599
Really?

256
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,839
Yes. Really.

257
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:06,481
But let's not, tonight. I
wasn't being nice to you.

258
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:07,943
No!

259
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,885
Please. I want you to
make love to me now.

260
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:52,420
My body is getting so
hot and I'm getting wet.

261
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,232
I'm so embarrassed.

262
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,167
Don't be.

263
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,275
You're so wet, it's great.

264
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,312
Oh, Masaki...

265
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,219
Saori.

266
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:22,852
I'm coming in.

267
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,051
Okay.

268
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:28,494
It hurts!

269
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,995
Oh, sorry.

270
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,837
No, don't pull out.

271
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,932
I wanna do this.

272
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,239
Okay. All right then.

273
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:06,128
Let's stop, Saori. That's enough for today.

274
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:07,635
Huh?

275
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,068
Okay...

276
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:12,937
I'm sorry Masaki.

277
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,138
But it really hurts...

278
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,775
Don't worry about it.

279
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,546
But it leaves you hanging...

280
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,379
Yeah, but what can you do?

281
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,918
We'll try again next time.

282
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:31,922
No, I can do it! I want
to make you feel good.

283
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:33,760
But...

284
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,058
You want to cum, right?

285
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,534
Well... yeah...

286
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,366
Honesty's the best policy!

287
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:58,784
You're really good, Saori.

288
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,073
Yes...

289
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,766
Yes... I'm going to cum...

290
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,271
I can't... hold it anymore!

291
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,619
H-hey.

292
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:03,946
Are you sure?

293
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,718
It's bitter, Masaki.

294
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,460
And my jaw hurts.

295
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:12,624
Thanks.

296
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,223
Uh-huh.

297
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:19,030
I'll practice more and get better at it.

298
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,673
Will you always stay by my side?

299
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,910
Oh my god. I'm so happy!

300
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,650
Let's spend our lives together...

301
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,343
Okay.
