1
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:15,004
Even now I'm bound by invisible chains...

2
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,384
Once you get used to it...

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,488
...even everyday madness
can become a natural thing.

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,153
And what little pain there
was, is no longer...

5
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,062
What I've lost now looms ever larger...

6
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:34,791
...while even the little things
that have supported me so far...

7
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:42,239
...if I try to grasp them, they
just slip through my fingers.

8
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:48,573
Leaving only tiny shards of memories...

9
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,597
Ouch! Oh!

10
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:47,065
Please... please forgive me!

11
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,381
What are you talking about?
Your punishment has just begun!

12
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,210
You must learn to stay
still and endure the pain.

13
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,852
Please, please make him stop now!

14
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:06,189
I don't think so. She shirked
her duties as a maid, after all!

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,326
But... I'm the one who told her to rest.

16
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,127
You can punish me in her place.

17
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,866
Please, don't take it out on Liz...

18
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:13,266
This is your punishment.
Please, don't take it out on Liz...

19
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,699
This is your punishment.

20
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,399
You need to understand what
your actions bring about.

21
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,738
Take a good, hard look, now...

22
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,008
Foster! I beg of you!

23
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,368
What's wrong?

24
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,377
Nothing.

25
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,809
Foster, you would never go
against my orders, would you?

26
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,949
No. As long as it's not
an unreasonable order.

27
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,221
You are a very wise man!

28
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:40,983
Exactly the kind of mind-set
a butler should have!

29
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:21,500
MAIDEN OF DELIVERANCE
Episode 2

30
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:23,459
Ouch!

31
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:24,967
Please, be brave now.

32
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,264
We have to make sure
these scars go away.

33
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:33,405
Doesn't it bother you at all,
Miss Clair? Any of this?

34
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,910
I'm sorry. It was all my fault...

35
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,478
Carol didn't used to be that kind of person.

36
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,181
She would get angry a lot...

37
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,990
...but she did have a
kind, caring side too...

38
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:57,225
Liz, I suppose one day you too
will learn how to stop fighting...

39
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,728
...and go along with the flow...

40
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,902
And then it will be just the same
thing happening over and over...

41
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,049
I've been investigating the
Wellacuster conglomerate.

42
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,452
It looks like they're planning
a hostile takeover...

43
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,690
...of the Burton Railroad after all.

44
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,185
Just as I thought...

45
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,586
However, there seems to be
something else going on as well...

46
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,355
You mean their plans to go public?

47
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,725
I didn't think you knew about that...

48
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,062
Father!

49
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,175
Good morning, Miss Carol!

50
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,884
All right, everyone, I expect
you all to work hard today too!

51
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,917
Yes, ma'am. Rest assured.

52
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:00,189
Monica! It's time to clean
the house, you know?

53
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,223
You don't have to tell me!

54
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,666
If this would only snap into place...

55
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,672
Emit, it looks like it's just going
to be you and me today...

56
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,045
What?

57
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:12,312
Foster!
What?

58
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:12,573
Foster!

59
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,910
Are you making any
progress training the maids?

60
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,043
Yes. Everything is going as planned.

61
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,015
Well, then, I suppose they're about ready...

62
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,111
...to entertain guests on their own.

63
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,786
No, I think that would be premature.

64
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,252
But we're expecting some
very important guests today...

65
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,057
...important to the Wellacuster Business!

66
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,994
Today, ma'am? Then we'll
have Clair or Leese...

67
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:41,232
No, wait. I think I'd rather have Liz do it!

68
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,943
But I don't think Liz has had enough train...

69
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:44,177
Why do you have to defy me at every turn?
But I don't think Liz has had enough train...

70
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,872
Why do you have to defy me at every turn?

71
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,072
I'm ordering you!

72
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,340
Understood?

73
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,814
How does it taste?

74
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,050
It's good.

75
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,557
Do you really mean that?

76
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,154
Yes, it's not bad at all.

77
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,259
It was Emit who made that, you know!

78
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,234
Foster!

79
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:08,701
Thank you very much!
Foster!

80
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:08,962
Thank you very much!

81
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,227
No, it's because you
worked hard on it, Emit.

82
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,828
I'm so happy for you, Emit.

83
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,767
Yes, this is the first time someone's
ever complimented my cooking!

84
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,200
Foster!

85
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,910
Yes, what can I do for you, ma'am?

86
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,703
Isn't it about time the guests arrived?

87
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,173
I believe it's still early...

88
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,743
Never mind, I want you to come at once!

89
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,578
Yes, I'll be right there.

90
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,183
You're much too lenient with the maids!

91
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,417
You're going to have to run a tighter ship!

92
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,521
Mr. Foster seems to have
accepted Miss Carol completely.

93
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:38,927
It looks that way...

94
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,562
I wonder how Miss Clair
feels about all this?

95
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:42,095
Huh?

96
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,571
Is something the matter?

97
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,433
I just thought I'd make some tea.

98
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,253
You understand what it is
you have to do, don't you?

99
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,316
Y-yes, sir...

100
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:07,160
Pardon me.

101
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,693
Well, well!
Pardon me.

102
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:07,749
Pardon me.

103
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,156
That's certainly something
to look forward to!

104
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:10,826
Pardon me.

105
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:17,034
Well! You're right, she's
gorgeous. She's like a little doll!

106
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,101
Liz! Don't dawdle like that!

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,372
N-no, ma'am.

108
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,036
All right, I'd like to have a turn now...

109
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:04,140
Come on!

110
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,023
Come on, you need to stick out your hips!

111
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,692
What were you thinking?

112
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,429
What is it?

113
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,931
You shouldn't have made a
first-timer like Liz entertain 2 guests.

114
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,499
You went too far.

115
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,236
Don't you dare lecture me!

116
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:05,703
The problem with you is...

117
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,204
...have you forgotten what your
position is in this household?

118
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,612
I am very much aware of it.

119
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,007
No, you don't have the faintest idea!

120
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,078
There's only victors and losers here!

121
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,115
All the losers have to do is show
the victor absolute obedience!

122
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,396
Did you attain that position just so you
could trample all over other people?

123
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,328
I'm asking you not to inflict
such cruelty on the maids.

124
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,013
Stop it! Stop it! I said stop it! Let go of me!

125
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:47,815
Ouch!

126
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,417
Shut up and lie still!

127
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,855
Ouch! Stop it!

128
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:06,360
Stop it! Ouch! Please, please stop it!

129
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:14,706
I beg of you! Stop it!

130
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,745
Where are your parents?

131
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,142
I don't know...

132
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,643
What do you mean?

133
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,020
My father was running a
factory, but it got shut down...

134
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,756
And the next thing I knew,
both my parents were gone.

135
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,622
But I still believe that one
day they'll be back...

136
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,831
And when they do, they'll
fix that clock for me...

137
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:38,935
You're right.

138
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:41,468
Go back to your room, now.

139
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:48,973
You see, Flora... Flora isn't
really my little sister...

140
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,111
But we've been together for so long...

141
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,151
...that little girl's the only
thing that keeps me going.

142
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,418
You're from a wealthy
family, aren't you, Lily?

143
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,284
You don't talk like the rest of us.

144
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,255
Now I'm just the same as you...

145
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,498
I can't survive in this world
unless I sell my body.

146
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,195
Life isn't fair, is it?

147
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,698
Wh-what are you...?

148
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:21,068
No, not there! NO! Please, stop! Ahhh!

149
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,703
I really don't think Carol's up to the task.

150
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:51,067
Both her elder brother and sister were
running entire companies at her age.

151
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,746
But Carol is still very much a child.

152
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,639
That's not true! Father! Mother!

153
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,215
I'm not just a child!

154
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:07,122
I swear... I swear I'll live
up to all your expectations!

155
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,161
Perhaps she's not quite up to
carrying on the Wellacuster name...

156
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,633
It's because you spoiled her
so when she was growing up.

157
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,131
I'm so disappointed in Carol...

158
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,635
Please wait!

159
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,633
You're nothing but a child.

160
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,487
Father! Mother! Wait! Wait!

161
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:01,407
Hey! Take a good look! At
what a vulgar sight you are!

162
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,784
Don't look away, dammit!

163
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,594
NO!

164
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:22,688
Are you having the maids
entertain just to bully them?

165
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,654
And what if I am?

166
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,858
You'll never understand what it's like!

167
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,164
Having to win all the time!

168
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,864
What it's like to have to
win day after day, forever!

169
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,464
Is it so important for you to win?

170
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:39,604
That's right! A Wellacuster
can't afford to lose!

171
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,774
How dare you look at me like that!

172
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,684
How can you always be so
damned calm and collected?

173
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,182
I happen to be older than you, Miss Carol...

174
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,323
...and therefore better
able to hide my emotions.

175
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,428
Don't you dare treat me like a child!

176
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,603
If you're looking to cure your irritability...

177
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,836
...this is a very effective method.

178
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,305
Again...

179
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:14,940
What?

180
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,714
Kiss me again! I order you to!

181
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,244
Yes, ma'am, I shall do so.

182
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,250
The truth is... I never
intended to make Liz a maid.

183
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,456
Then why did you?

184
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:36,301
When you first met her, you
looked at her with such kind eyes.

185
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,777
I couldn't stand it... So I
wanted to destroy her...

186
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:11,898
Is something the matter?

187
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:16,068
Yes. Um... It's about Mr. Foster.

188
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,456
About the other day... I'm sure
you've been quite angry...

189
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:33,950
Why would I be?

190
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,788
I knew all about it...

191
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,927
...That Mr. Foster had
chosen you, Miss Clair.

192
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,961
Foster hasn't chosen
anyone, much less me.

193
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,272
But I... I've had my eye on
Mr. Foster all this time, too!

194
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,271
Mr. Foster is someone I
hold dear to my heart, too!

195
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,009
I see...

196
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,278
I'm not going give up on him!

197
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,257
Excuse me...

198
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,053
Well, good work!

199
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,226
Excuse me.

200
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,714
Can't you sleep?

201
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,641
When did you start drinking?

202
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,512
This is my first drink.

203
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,486
I thought it might help
me drown my sorrows.

204
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,387
But it's not working. It's
just as Aisha said...

205
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,595
You can't drive yourself to drink like this!

206
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,433
Give that back to me! I
want to forget everything!

207
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,199
I want to forget about this
mansion... about you, Foster!

208
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:58,404
Clair...

209
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,988
Miss Carol, are you bringing
the guests down here?

210
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,396
Just shut up and follow me!

211
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,672
Lily! Have you seen Miss Carol?

212
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:38,539
No, sir...

213
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,548
I haven't seen her either.

214
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:44,048
That's strange. I'm sure the
guests have arrived by now.

215
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:50,954
Don't tell me...

216
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,578
Are you all right?

217
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,511
Isn't there something
you'd like to say to me?

218
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:25,990
Clair!

219
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:28,657
Why won't you talk to me?

220
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,057
If I asked you to rescue me...

221
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,825
...would you come to my aid?

222
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:35,956
Or on the other hand...

223
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,561
...do you enjoy watching all
my suffering and humiliation?

224
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,440
What is it?

225
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:53,815
Excuse me.

226
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,315
Is something the matter?

227
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,691
No... But as long as you're with me...

228
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,660
...you're never going to have
much of a life, you know.

229
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:06,589
I suppose you're right.

230
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,825
So you're not going to deny it?

231
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,069
Well, but that kind of life
can't be all bad either, can it?

232
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,101
Actually, I have some news for you.

233
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:17,603
What?

234
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,474
The plan to take over the
Burton Railroad has failed.

235
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:22,506
Are you sure?

236
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:23,046
Yes!

237
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:27,242
However, I have reason to believe
that this was also part of the plan...

238
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,382
What do you mean?

239
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,420
They wanted to get involved in the
government's plans to go public...

240
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:36,424
...so that they'd have an edge
in all future developments.

241
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:41,129
In other words, Carol was nothing
more than a stalking-horse.

242
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,032
Yes.

243
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,402
You wanted to see me?

244
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,200
It's all over... I've lost.

245
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:54,676
All I wanted was to demonstrate
my abilities in this town...

246
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,709
...so that my parents and my siblings
would recognize me as an equal...

247
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,453
How can you be so unaffected by all this?

248
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:03,350
Excuse me?

249
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,852
Well, you're someone on
the losing side, aren't you?

250
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,752
Isn't that why you're serving me?

251
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:09,958
That is correct.

252
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:14,229
Well, then how can you be so arrogant?

253
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,466
You always act like you know everything!

254
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,197
You're inconsiderate! And haughty!

255
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,034
You're the most unpleasant
man I've ever met!

256
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,372
What am I to do?

257
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,804
In times of suffering...

258
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,013
...shouldn't you just accept the fact
that you have to ask someone for help.

259
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,950
But how do I do that?

260
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,579
Would you like me to teach you?

261
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:38,584
Yes...

262
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,751
Do you think you can do as you're told?

263
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:47,956
Excuse me...

264
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:49,891
Get out!

265
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,071
What are you doing? Just get out! Now!

266
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,637
Don't mind her. Stay and watch.

267
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,975
What... what are you
doing? Stop it right now!

268
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,006
You have a lot to learn...

269
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,547
I can't allow you to leave this room...

270
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,317
...until that rebellious look
in your eyes is gone!

271
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,817
What... you stop that! NO!

272
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:20,391
No! S-stop it...

273
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,895
Liz, what are you going to do?

274
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,511
Please... please stop it!

275
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,623
It was... it was terrible when
it was happening to me.

276
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,216
So it must be terrible for Carol...

277
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,655
Don't you dare feel sorry for me!

278
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,823
If I don't stop you from
mistreating Carol now...

279
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:59,034
...then that means that I've
accepted being abused myself...

280
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,132
I don't want any of your pity!

281
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,203
Stop being so stubborn.

282
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,371
All you have to do is apologize.

283
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,078
Are you telling me to
get down on my knees?

284
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,642
I was the same way.

285
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:10,174
What?

286
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,913
Even after I'd lost everything...

287
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,581
...I just didn't have it in me to apologize...

288
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:18,290
That's why...

289
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:18,423
That's enough... really, that's enough.
That's why...

290
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,516
That's enough... really, that's enough.

291
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,185
I don't think I can ever forgive you...

292
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,566
But I have no intention of
seeking revenge against you...

293
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:30,930
Liz...

294
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,301
You called her a loser, didn't you?

295
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,908
But someone like her, who
can take anything with tears...

296
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:46,711
...is far stronger.

297
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:49,685
Just give in and cry.

298
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,953
And after you've done that, you'll be able
to beg Liz for forgiveness, won't you?

299
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,234
Clair... I wasn't able to stop this.

300
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,167
What are you talking about?

301
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,473
It seems that Miss Carol will be
leaving this house tomorrow.

302
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:18,449
What?

303
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,449
They are going to tear down this mansion.

304
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,688
Oh... are they really?

305
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,682
I did everything I could...

306
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,552
It's not your fault, Foster.

307
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,425
What will you do?

308
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:32,959
Let me see...

309
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,427
...first of all, I'd like to have
a good cup of tea with you.

310
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,607
How is it?

311
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:47,607
It's delicious!

312
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,483
I'd forgotten that I could feel like this...

313
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,052
Excuse me...

314
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,054
What do you want?

315
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,964
We are ready to leave now.

316
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,158
All right.

317
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,038
Liz?

318
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:14,701
Yes?

319
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,973
You're a free woman now.

320
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:17,469
What?

321
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,306
I'm saying that all of
your debt has been paid.

322
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,310
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:29,751
Carol...

324
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,893
Foster, why don't you come with me?

325
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:39,291
What?

326
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,823
I'd like you to work with
me as my right-hand man.

327
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,926
I don't think it's such a bad proposition.

328
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,100
Thank you, but...

329
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,534
Are you thinking of Clair?

330
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,038
That's what I thought.

331
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,844
Is that woman so important to you?

332
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,279
Yes... more than anything else in the world.

333
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,337
Idiot!

334
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:58,574
Miss Carol...

335
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,377
It's the deed to the mansion!

336
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,852
Do whatever you want!

337
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,587
You just might have been...

338
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,853
...that important to me, you know...

339
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:17,261
Haaa!

340
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:23,249
I'm left with many scars...

341
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,946
...but these scars have taught me...

342
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,056
...that life is all about getting hurt.

343
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,022
I've made an important decision...

344
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:35,857
Beautiful, isn't it?

345
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:37,526
Foster...

346
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:38,998
Forgive me.

347
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,038
Don't apologize. It's not
like you to be apologetic.

348
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,271
I've lost so much over the years.

349
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:53,114
And yet... I was so close to losing
the one important thing in my life.

350
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:57,917
Never mind... you see, I've decided...

351
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,625
...that I'm going to live my
life with you the way you are.

352
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,191
Are you sure you want to do that?

353
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:03,787
Yes.

354
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,160
I'm a cruel kind of man. Are you still sure?

355
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:08,828
Yes...

356
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:11,958
...because...

357
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,801
...I'm a woman, you see...
