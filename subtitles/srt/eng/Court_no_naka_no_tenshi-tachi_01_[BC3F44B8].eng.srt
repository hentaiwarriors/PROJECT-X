1
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,000
- Mr. Motoura.
- Ms. Oyama.

2
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,000
Call me Mayumi.

3
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,570
What's the difference?

4
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,850
That's good.

5
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,290
So good.

6
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,620
You're so tight. What's with you?

7
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,880
Mr. Motoura, incredible!
Hot, like an iron rod!

8
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,210
I'm coming.

9
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,020
I'm coming!

10
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,260
Thick is the chest
of an ex-All Japan Team spiker.

11
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,570
I never thought we'd be like this.

12
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,400
When you came to our school
six months ago...

13
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,910
...you were rough and hard
to get close to.

14
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,540
I'd had it.

15
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,940
I couldn't trust people
and I hated the world.

16
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,240
Those girls saved you.

17
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,550
What a bad man.

18
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,850
You did nasty
with all the volleyball players, and now me.

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,720
Nothing happened with them.

20
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,920
Liar. Some of them used be virgins.

21
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,860
No, really, nothing.

22
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,960
Who was the best?

23
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,930
See, I knew it.

24
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,890
I'm kidding.

25
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,000
Let go, let go!

26
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,950
Got it!

27
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,780
Sho Marui - Left Front - Scorpio
5'9" - 35-23-36 - Blood Type: A

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,290
Nao Inabe - Right Front - Leo
5'10" - 35-24-35 - Blood Type: B

29
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,160
There.

30
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,040
Kumi Marui - Setter - Aries
5'6" - 31-22-31 - Blood Type: AB

31
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,100
Got it.

32
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,240
Mayumi Kitajima - Center - Capricorn
5'8" - 33-22-33 Blood Type: A

33
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,020
Kuzuha Shionogi - Left Back - Taurus
5'9" - 32-22-33 - Blood Type: A

34
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,380
There.

35
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,990
Mio Matsuda - Center - Virgo
5'10" - 35-27-35 Blood Type: AB

36
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,360
Take that!

37
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,920
Kozue Nekoda - Substitute - Libra
5'7" - 33-22-33 Blood Type: B

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,280
Angels in the Court

39
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,350
City Championship

40
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,890
Aota Academy

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,830
Here you go.

42
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,430
Sho!

43
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,700
Oh Motoura - 27y.o. - Leo
6'3" - Blood Type: B

44
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,930
Your back was open.

45
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,670
You moved in too far.
You lose speed that way.

46
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,540
Yes, sir.

47
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,640
Kumi, you set it
one inch too close to the net.

48
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,290
Okay.

49
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,250
Next.

50
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,330
Oops. Out.

51
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,930
Nao. Put your heart into it.

52
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,940
Okay.

53
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,800
Next. Next.

54
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,920
Shionogi.
Why can't you dive in farther?

55
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,780
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,690
- Kitajima. Drop your hip!
- Yes.

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,970
Matsuda, don't look tired.

58
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,700
If you look tired in a game,
they'll bombard you.

59
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,300
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,170
- Nekoda.

61
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,050
Aota Academy is nothing to us.

62
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,580
They're no match for us.

63
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,630
The ticket to
the National Championship Game...

64
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,590
...is in the hands of yours truly,
Kabanishi and O-Ring Academy...

65
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,140
- Listen to us.
- Hey, you, bitches.

66
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,770
Who's that, the Drama Club?

67
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,970
No way, you don't know us?

68
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,880
- Not a clue. Selling something?
- Shut up, you student call girl.

69
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,620
- What did you say?
- Come on!

70
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,950
Wait.

71
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,480
Oh, more!

72
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,290
Motoura!

73
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,850
Long time no see.

74
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,700
Who are you?

75
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,170
It's me. Your arch enemy.
Haruo Kabanishi.

76
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,000
- Huh?
- What do you mean, huh?

77
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,070
Kabanishi Haruo,
O-Ring Academy coach and...

78
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,240
...Aiko Yada, their ace spiker.

79
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,410
Kabanishi and our Coach Motoura
were rivals on the All Japan Team.

80
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,570
That's me.

81
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,750
Haruo Kabanishi - 27y.o. - Virgo
6'2" - Blood Type: A

82
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,220
Aiko Yada is rumored to be
a shoe-in for the All Japan Team.

83
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,420
Well informed.

84
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,220
Aiko Yada - O-Ring Academy - Scorpio
5'10" - 34-23-33 - Blood Type: AB

85
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,560
Not bad to play for laughs.

86
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,500
- You bitch, shut your trap...
- Don't.

87
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,870
Motoura, I'll see you at
the City Championship Game.

88
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,600
Wait a minute. Who are you?

89
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,570
He doesn't remember.

90
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,440
Sho Marui.

91
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,750
I will never lose to you.

92
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,850
Let's go, Aiko.

93
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,380
We'll practice
our Rolling Killer Special.

94
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,090
Yes, Coach.

95
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,370
Good-bye. Good-bye.

96
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,280
- Killer...
- Rolling Special...

97
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,410
- Major Roll...
- Uhhh...

98
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,790
- Finish.
- Right.

99
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,820
A new strategy, perhaps.

100
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,010
Okay. We'll send out spies.

101
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,390
Mission lmpossible in Disguise.

102
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,930
Regular clothing would be less conspicuous.

103
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,590
Got it.

104
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,610
Nanase Morimura - Gemini
5'9" - 33-22-33 - Blood Type: AB

105
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,310
Who is she?

106
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,550
Coach Motoura?

107
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,050
Yeah.

108
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,820
Nanase Morimura, 8th grade,
a new transfer student.

109
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,900
I heard this team was contending
for the championship, like O-Ring.

110
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,190
I see.

111
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,200
You move in too close
when you spike.

112
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,400
You set one inch too close to the net.

113
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,030
That makes it harder for her.

114
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,280
You have supreme talent,
but your heart's not in it.

115
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,320
You don't dive close enough
when you receive.

116
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,220
Defenseless against a good fake.

117
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,920
You lack concentration.

118
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,160
What's with you?
Coming out of nowhere.

119
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,660
Show us how you play.

120
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,180
- All talk and no walk. Get up.
- Nao, that's enough.

121
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,760
Give me a few minutes.

122
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,300
Suck it.

123
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,370
No.

124
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,210
That's good.

125
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,530
Ready. Now I'll show them.

126
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,030
Wait! What is this?

127
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,970
There.

128
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,770
Got it!

129
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,080
Incredible.

130
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,640
There.

131
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,360
She's good.

132
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,490
Nanase Morimura, she's joining us.

133
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,240
The mysterious new student.

134
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,240
You can't stir ice cream soda.

135
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,410
- Why not?
- It gets muddy.

136
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,350
- Tastes better that way.
- Ice cream soda doesn't suit you.

137
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,820
But she wants to be a manager.

138
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,780
- Who?
- Nanase, I mean.

139
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,290
She doesn't want to play.
Same thing at her previous school.

140
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,160
What's her deal?

141
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,000
A player like that is hard to find anywhere.

142
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,830
I hate muddy ice cream soda.

143
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,530
You're not drinking it!

144
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,700
Oops.

145
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,560
I'm outta here.

146
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,140
Where to, Nao?

147
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,680
Work.

148
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,090
Massage Parlor

149
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,790
Coach.

150
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,460
Hey, Sho, isn't it?

151
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,330
What is this store?

152
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,470
Massage Parlor

153
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,410
Coach, don't you have a girlfriend?

154
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,380
No, I don't.

155
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,120
And you?

156
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,120
What about...

157
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,390
What about me?

158
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,860
No.

159
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,090
You play, I coach.

160
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,500
I've noticed you look really sad
from time to time.

161
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,470
Anything I could do...

162
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,910
Give me some release!

163
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,970
Lick my balls, one at a time.

164
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,080
If you play well,
that's all I can ask for.

165
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,490
- Coach.
- Sho.

166
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,550
I'm really doing this.
My heart is ready to burst.

167
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,190
I don't want to let you go.

168
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,590
But then I won't be able to hold you.

169
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,180
Coach. Mr. Motoura.

170
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,700
<i>Excuse me.</i>

171
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,340
I brought you something to drink.

172
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,520
I didn't order anything.

173
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,210
It's on the house.

174
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,580
Nao, Aota Students
are not allowed to work.

175
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,790
What about doing the nasty
with a student in a Karaoke box?

176
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,190
There's nothing about it
in the School rules, but...

177
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,750
...why are you taking your clothes off?

178
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,590
Captain, you can't monopolize him.

179
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,470
I'm joining you.

180
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,030
Put it in.

181
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,100
Nao.

182
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,970
What a horrible man.
Couldn't you find a more romantic spot?

183
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,270
- The place doesn't matter.
- What dedication.

184
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,750
Men love first-time girls like this,
don't they?

185
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,480
Shut up.

186
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,690
No.

187
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,660
Coach, give it to me, too.

188
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,900
Time to hear you sing here.

189
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,340
It's going in.

190
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,950
No, no!

191
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,170
It's so good.

192
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,030
Karaoke

193
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,010
<i>More time, please.</i>

194
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,440
If we win the semi-finals tomorrow,
we'll play O-Ring in the finals.

195
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,010
Yeah.

196
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,200
Her turn, maybe.

197
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,430
- Nanase, get changed and warm up.
- Okay.

198
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,410
Time out!

199
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,150
What's wrong?

200
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,160
- You're not playing serious!
- Nao.

201
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,630
- Captain, say something.
- Coach, it's not working out.

202
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,320
I guess.

203
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,500
Let's all stay focused.

204
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,940
- Hey, let him go!
- Coach!

205
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,720
Go, go, Aota!

206
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,860
Go, go, Aota!

207
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,360
- Don't.
- Are you toying with me?

208
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,240
- My cherry is for someone I love.
- You gotta be kidding.

209
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,780
What about this?
Finish what you started.

210
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,370
Let's go.

211
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,480
Let me finish it.

212
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,990
Take that!

213
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,470
Coach, do it to me, too.

214
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,970
<i>Now I get it.</i>
<i>Nanase needs to be loved.</i>

215
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,140
<i>Only then she can relax.</i>

216
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,120
<i>Only then can she let herself go</i>
<i>and play to her full potential.</i>

217
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,230
<i>And she's still a virgin.</i>

218
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,730
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

219
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,070
If we beat O-Ring,
we'll be in the National Championship.

220
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,230
With your ability...

221
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:42,310
I need that at every game.
No, I need that at every practice.

222
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,350
I can't bother you like that, can I?

223
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,850
It's no bother.

224
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,360
I love volleyball.
I really love it, so I quit.

225
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,230
Can you forget volleyball,
just like that?

226
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,360
But if you've made up your mind.

227
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,060
You can come back anytime.

228
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,700
I'll be waiting.

229
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,770
Tomorrow is the final.
Practice spikes and serves, and that's it.

230
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,940
No, no.

231
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,750
You were looking at me
with dirty thoughts, weren't you?

232
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,830
Go practice. Start practicing!

233
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,530
Yes.

234
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,290
<i>It's the finals tomorrow.</i>
<i>I have to focus on the ball.</i>

235
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,670
Exploding Pain!
Ball Pain!

236
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,610
Broken Dick - Nervous Explosion
Supreme Zen-like Pain

237
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,050
Don't act all jealous,
just because you got laid once.

238
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,460
- Men don't like jealousy.
- It's not like that.

239
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,930
There's a game tomorrow.
Go home.

240
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,410
As soon as you have your release,
you get cold.

241
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,520
Yo, give us some release, too.

242
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,080
- No!
- Don't be so mean.

243
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,590
We can force you, you know.

244
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,630
- Coach.
- You have a game tomorrow. Run.

245
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,430
But...

246
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,160
Buzz off, if you don't want to get hurt.

247
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,640
Your dick's out. Shut up.

248
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,410
- Kozue, run.
- Okay!

249
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,740
Asshole.
Stupid.

250
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,300
Take this.

251
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,310
Sis. It's the Coach!

252
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,710
What?

253
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,920
<i>Today's the finals.</i>
<i>Our match against O-Ring Academy.</i>

254
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,490
<i>But Nao got hurt, Coach is missing,</i>
<i>and my sister got sick!</i>

255
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,960
<i>We're in trouble!</i>

256
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,770
<i>So, is that all you got?</i>
<i>What a disappointment!</i>

257
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:21,480
<i>I am the only one who can save them!</i>
<i>Coach, please give me energy!</i>

258
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,080
<i>- Nanase!</i>
<i>- Coach!</i>

259
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,450
Angeles in the Court.
<i>Second set.</i>

260
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,020
<i>We've also prepared</i>
<i>many nasty scenes for you!</i>

261
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,420
We'll see you soon!
