1
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,850
And do you, Hayami Emi, vow to stay faithful
to Tomomi in sickness and in health,

2
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,810
for richer or for poorer, for as
long as you both shall live?

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,270
I do.

4
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,020
Yahoo!

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,990
Now, Tomomi-kun, you and I can live happily
ever after and no one will bother us.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,030
Onee-chan, isn't this going too fast?

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,070
Idiot.

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,950
Doing this is the only way I'll be
allowed to take care of you.

9
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,080
Do you have any idea how frustrating it was

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,670
trying to break into that circle of girls fawning over you?

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,790
I didn't know.

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,460
You need me by your side.

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,300
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to cope.

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,090
But society prefers to ignore the idea of
cousins finding happiness together.

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,180
I love you.

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,470
Me too.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,020
No!

18
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,160
What are you doing?

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,340
Oh, dear. Look at how wet she is.

20
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,630
Stop it! Don't look at me down there!

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,390
She's still a virgin. It seems Tomomi-sama is safe then.

22
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,680
Who are all of you?

23
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,900
Be silent, Amy.

24
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,570
You need do nothing except obey our commands.

25
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,280
My name isn't Amy!

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,200
Good girl, Amy.

27
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,990
Please stop it!

28
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,910
"Please stop it"? Don't say that, Amy.

29
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,870
Say, "More, please."

30
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,750
You're a good girl, Amy.

31
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,930
My, how squishy you are.

32
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,350
I'll make your fantasies come true.

33
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,570
Don't call me Amy!

34
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:43,311
Amy to yobanaide
Don't call me Amy! - Episode 1

35
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,250
Onee-chan? Onee-chan?

36
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,420
Tomomi-kun!

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,040
Class is over.

38
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,630
Oh, it was a dream!

39
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,670
Oh, dear.

40
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,090
Don't tell me you were daydreaming again?

41
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,430
Must've been.

42
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,480
Tomorrow's our birthdays, so I'm gonna dress
up and have a fancy dinner with you.

43
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,110
I guess I'll wear something fancy too.

44
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,690
Emi!
I guess I'll wear something fancy too.

45
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,200
Emi!

46
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,910
Oh, Captain!

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,910
Today is the open house, right?

48
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,870
Come on, you'd better change so we can practice.

49
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,830
Today we're gonna try to get some boys
into the rhythmic gymnastics club.

50
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,500
Unless you're there, Emi, the volleyball
club will get all the attention!

51
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,050
But I'm not as good as you, Hitomi-san.

52
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,470
Now don't say that. The boys love
watching you most of all.

53
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,600
Right, Tomomi-kun?

54
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,690
0-0h, yeah. Tomomi-kun, are you coming to watch?

55
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,110
Uh, no, thanks. I've got a lot of things to do at home.

56
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,820
Onee-chan, I'll make plenty of
curry. I know it's your favorite.

57
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,490
Thanks! And don't forget to do the laundry.

58
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,610
Yes, yes, leave it to me. Bye!

59
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,200
Is it just me, or has Tomomi gotten
more manly these days?

60
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,910
Eh, really?

61
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,080
To me, he's just the same old unreliable softy.

62
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,650
Oh, Hitomi-san, sorry about that.

63
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,860
Don't apologize. I was almost finished. Come on in.

64
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,730
Thanks.

65
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,320
<i>Amazing!</i>

66
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,570
Emi-san, can I ask you a favor?

67
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,240
Yes!

68
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,660
Can you fix me up with Tomomi-kun?

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,710
Come on, you know all the girls
are crazy about him, right?

70
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,260
Yeah.

71
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,680
But they're all too scared to ask him out.

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,930
I don't want to end up like those
other girls. Will you help?

73
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,850
But that should be up to him.

74
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,850
Oh, come on, you know he admires you.

75
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,350
He calls you "Onee-chan" all the time.

76
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,990
I'm sure if you put in a good word for me, he'd trust you.

77
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,700
I'm begging you, okay? I'll do anything to thank you.

78
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,710
But it's strange that he calls you "Onee-chan",
even though you're the same age.

79
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,510
It's been that way since we were kids.

80
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,010
I don't think it's strange at all.

81
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,630
Well I'd appreciate your help, Emi-san.

82
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,220
Your body is really beautiful, by the way.

83
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,060
Not as beautiful as yours, Hitomi-san.

84
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,230
<i>Jeez, every girl and her mother is after Tomomi-kunl</i>

85
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,280
<i>I can't let my guard down.</i>

86
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,700
<i>Tomomi-kun is so naive.</i>

87
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,830
<i>If Hitomi came on to him with that killer body
of hers, I wouldn't be able to take it!</i>

88
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,340
To-mo-mi-kun!

89
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,800
Boo!

90
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,520
Tomomi-kun! Tomomi-kun, don't die!

91
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,150
Hey! Wake up!

92
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,530
<i>He's just so awkward.</i>

93
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,950
<i>If Hitomi came on to him seriously
he'd probably die of a heart attack.</i>

94
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,780
<i>Tomomi-kun, you belong only to me.</i>

95
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,750
<i>And tomorrow is our birthdays, after all.</i>

96
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,340
<i>Maybe I should give him my naked body as a present.</i>

97
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,800
Tomomi-kun!

98
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,310
Can you wash this too?

99
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,350
And while were here, let's take a bath together!

100
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,310
Wow, Onee-chan, I didn't know
you had such a hot body!

101
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,730
Aw, don't say that I just...

102
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,910
Wow, Tomomi-kun, you're really bold today.

103
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,780
That's because you want me to be bold.

104
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,830
Aw, crap, not again! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

105
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,300
Ow!

106
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,840
Do you live around here?

107
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,140
You want to talk to me?

108
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,940
I was your father's secretary a year
ago, before he passed away.

109
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,060
I'm Takami Rie.

110
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,020
You worked for Dad?

111
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,940
Yes. And I want to discuss something with you today.

112
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,530
What's wrong, Miss?

113
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,030
I'm back, Onee-chan.

114
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,240
Tomomi-kun!

115
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,420
Tomorrow I'll really work hard
to make us a delicious dinner.

116
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,880
That's weird.

117
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,800
What's wrong?

118
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,550
Uh, nothing! Well, I'll help make
the day more festive, too!

119
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,480
That smell!

120
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,940
I have a vital piece of information to give
Tomomi-sama before their birthdays tomorrow!

121
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,780
This smell is so powerful that it attracts animals.

122
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:06,870
By tomorrow, the entire human female
population may fall victim to it!

123
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,460
But before that happens...

124
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,590
Tomomi-sama must be cured.

125
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,140
You really are useless!

126
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,890
You haven't seduced him yet?

127
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,140
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

128
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,560
B-But he won't even look at me!

129
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,770
As long as Amy won't back off, Tomomi-sama won't...

130
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,650
Shut up! Shut up!

131
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,110
Tomomi-sama is not yet aware of his body's powers!

132
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,950
You must do something on his birthday tomorrow!

133
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,290
Understood?

134
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,870
Tomomi-kun!

135
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,670
Did you put on cologne or something?

136
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,130
Not that I know of.

137
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,050
Jeez. You'd better not suddenly go all sexy on me.

138
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,220
I can tell you're wearing cologne.

139
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,310
But that's not true.

140
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,400
I don't smell anything.

141
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,270
Hey, Onee-chan, can you take over
the vacuuming for a while?

142
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,610
I've got too much to do.

143
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,950
Uh, oh! The curry!

144
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,160
What is this smell?

145
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,040
<i>Its wafting through my body.</i>

146
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,170
<i>If it's not cologne, then could it be
the aroma of Tomomi's body?</i>

147
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,130
<i>No way. Nothing like this has happened before.</i>

148
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,350
<i>Whats going on? My chest hurts.</i>

149
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,780
My body is burning. I feel really weird.

150
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,040
I'd die if Tomomi-kun walked in on me right now.

151
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,510
Oops. I forgot to put in the onions.

152
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,680
But Onee-chan doesn't like onions.

153
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,390
Well, if I mince them, they'll flavor
the curry without interfering.

154
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,100
And it'll be tastier that way.

155
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,020
But if I put them in without asking, she might get mad.

156
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,950
My body... My body is hot.

157
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,450
Make it go away! Make it go away!

158
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,410
Oh no!

159
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,460
My hands are moving on their own.

160
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,670
I feel it.

161
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,630
How embarrassing.

162
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,630
What should I do?

163
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,220
No! Tomomi, don't come in. Don't come in!

164
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,350
Onee-chan, what's wrong?

165
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,640
Oh, no, Tomomi-kun. Something's happening to me.

166
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,110
Don't worry. I'm here with you.

167
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,780
Tomomi-kun!

168
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,870
Hey, listen, Onee-chan, can I put an onion in the curry?

169
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,490
Yes, put it in! Please!

170
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,540
Really? You won't mind if I put it in?

171
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,960
Put it in. Put it in. I'm begging you!

172
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,540
Onee-chan, is something wrong?

173
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,340
Put it in!

174
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,510
I'm coming in.

175
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,470
Come in! Come all the way inside!

176
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,890
Are you sure I can put it in?

177
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,310
What're you waiting around for? Hurry up!

178
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,150
Ah, Tomomi!

179
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,520
Onee-chan...

180
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,740
Tomomi-kun!

181
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,750
Tomomi-kun! Don't die on me!

182
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,540
Tomomi!

183
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,630
What have I done?

184
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,870
Tomomi-kun, I...

185
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,540
Oh, hey. You woke up?

186
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,540
Hey, listen, what in the world happened to me?

187
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,960
You said you weren't feeling well,
so you took a nap. Feeling better?

188
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,260
Well, I'm still lightheaded, but I do feel a lot better.

189
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,260
Yup. You don't seem to have a fever.

190
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,890
Should I bring you some curry?

191
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,560
It'll be good tomorrow for our birthday,
but we can taste it now.

192
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,810
Just wait here.

193
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,070
Okay. Thanks.

194
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,570
So maybe that was...

195
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,700
just one of my usual daydreams?

196
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,370
It must be.

197
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,540
Otherwise, Tomomi wouldn't be so calm around me.

198
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,620
Ew, how embarrassing!

199
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,760
It's Tomomi-sama's smell!

200
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,020
What a painfully pleasant fragrance!

201
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,230
Ah, I can't stand it!

202
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,980
Tomomi-sama!

203
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,320
Come to me...

204
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,910
At last. At last Tomomi's special
body type has activated.

205
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,830
I must take action before this
causes a national disaster.

206
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,250
No!

207
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,460
Tomomi-kun, why didn't you wake me up?

208
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,770
<i>I went to wake you up, but you
looked too peaceful to disturb.</i>

209
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,810
<i>I'll let you sleep as long as possible.</i>

210
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,270
<i>I have class duties this week,
so I'm leaving early. Tomomi.</i>

211
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,770
He's such a sweetie.

212
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,190
Uh, you're...

213
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,860
Good morning.

214
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,910
I wonder if Tomomi-san told you about your father.

215
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,960
He left a huge debt behind.

216
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,540
What? A debt?

217
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,210
Oh, dear. Well, I gave Tomomi-san
all the details last night.

218
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,220
Oh, no. I didn't hear anything about this!

219
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,180
Well, I wonder if Tomomi-san plans
on paying it off all by himself?

220
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
Yeah, right.

221
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Tomomi couldn't do something like that.

222
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,650
His parents died in a car crash, and my
dad was his only remaining family.

223
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,940
He's been staying with us most of his life!

224
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,530
But if neither you nor Tomomi-san can repay the debt,

225
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,030
this house will be repossessed.

226
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,830
Repossessed? Who the hell are you anyway?

227
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,083
I was your father's secretary.

228
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:47,256
Aditionally, I was his lover.

229
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,965
<i>Why didn't Tomomi-kun tell me about this?</i>

230
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:56,658
<i>He said there was nothing to worry about.</i>

231
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:59,600
<i>But how does he expect to solve this?</i>

232
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,560
<i>Tomomi-kun, what the hell are you thinking? Jeez!</i>

233
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,860
Was that Tomomi-kun?

234
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,530
Then who's that girl?

235
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,410
Tomomi-kun!

236
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,710
What do you think you're doing to Tomomi-kun!?

237
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,870
Emi-san...

238
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,610
N-No way.

239
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,450
What the hell are you doing, Tomomi!

240
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,750
Get away from him, Hitomi-san!

241
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,460
That wasn't supposed to happen!

242
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,060
At last you're awake.

243
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,940
Sumire-sensei...

244
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,270
Then am I in the infirmary?

245
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,780
Yes. I will heal both your body and soul.

246
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,950
Tell me what's troubling you.

247
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,580
I figured as much. She's in love.

248
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,040
Sensei!

249
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,960
Aw, there, there. Cry all you want.

250
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,970
Tears help love evolve!

251
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,470
Sensei, how do you know I'm crying about love?

252
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,600
Girls are all like that. You poor thing.

253
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,430
You lost him, didn't you?

254
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,520
Don't worry for I am with you!

255
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:16,360
If you truly love that young man,
you must not wander off course,

256
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,650
but pierce him head-on with your love!

257
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,860
Yeah. That look in his eyes was strange.

258
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:31,040
He must've been shocked to death by
Hitomi-san coming on so strong.

259
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,500
That's right. Love requires faith.

260
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,340
<i>But why then?</i>

261
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,380
<i>Lots of strange things have been
happening since last night.</i>

262
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,920
<i>I wonder if something's wrong with Tomomi-kun?</i>

263
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,430
<i>No. I don't want him to keep his troubles to himself.</i>

264
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,050
I can't sit still!

265
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,520
You twisted your ankle back there.

266
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,980
But don't worry. If you stay off it
today, the swelling will go down.

267
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,560
Thank you.

268
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,860
Hayami Emi-san.

269
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,530
Hayami Emi-san, please report immediately
to the Commissioner's Office.

270
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,200
The Commissioner has something
urgent to discuss with you.

271
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,370
What Kyoko-sensei?

272
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,290
My pico pico sandals...

273
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,660
How vexing! I hope a dog didn't eat them!

274
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,300
Hayami Emi... reporting.

275
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,420
Enter, please.

276
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,760
I'm going to cut to the chase, Hayami-san.

277
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,930
I hear you're engaging in lewd acts.

278
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,350
Huh? No? But I'm not!

279
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,150
I can confirm it by investigating a bit.

280
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,490
Please believe me.

281
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,910
Hitomi-san told me all about it.

282
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,830
But Hitomi-san is trying to steal Tomomi-kun from me.

283
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,630
I'm sure she made up some story to get me in trouble!

284
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,880
And on top of that your dead father
left behind a huge debt.

285
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,510
Selling your house to the bank
is your only option to repay it.

286
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,720
Now you won't be able to pay your school tuition.

287
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,430
Was it Tomomi-kun?

288
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,440
Did he tell you about that?

289
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:25,110
You engage in inappropriate sexual activity,
and you can't pay your tuition.

290
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,200
I don't think there's a place at this
school for either of you anymore.

291
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,240
But if you just do as I say...

292
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,710
you won't be expelled.

293
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,540
What do you think you're doing?

294
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,383
Think it through thoroughly.

295
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:54,672
I'll give you a day to decide.

296
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,030
<i>How cruel! I don't "engage in
inappropriate sexual activity"!</i>

297
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:10,030
<i>Sure, I have some pretty lewd fantasies now and then,</i>

298
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,950
<i>but I haven't done any of them
with the real Tomomi-kun.</i>

299
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:17,540
<i>Even though I want to, until I can, I'm gonna be patient.</i>

300
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,790
<i>But sometimes I get this strange feeling all over,</i>

301
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,880
<i>and I can't restrain myself.</i>

302
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,760
<i>Why is that? Ack, what am I thinking?</i>

303
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,654
<i>I need to figure out my tuition first.</i>

304
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:33,096
<i>Ah, I just don't know what to do.</i>

305
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,140
Onee-chan.

306
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,230
Tomomi!

307
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,440
What happened to your ankle?

308
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,110
Here. Let me carry you.

309
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,650
Idiot! Where were you all this time?

310
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,740
Umph. Okay, lets go home.

311
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,740
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

312
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,410
Ouch, ouch.

313
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,750
Sorry. I'm sorry, Onee-chan.

314
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,620
You don't care about my feelings at all! Stupid! Stupid!

315
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,580
There, there. Calm down, Onee-sama.

316
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,880
<i>Huh? I didn't know Tomomi's shoulders were this broad.</i>

317
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,550
<i>When did that happen?</i>

318
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,340
<i>Until yesterday I only thought of
him as a spineless little brother.</i>

319
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,730
Welcome back.

320
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,300
Since my father is gone, I'm the head of this household.

321
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,260
If you wish to discuss financial matters
talk to me instead of Tomomi-kun.

322
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,470
Very well.

323
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,640
Your father entrusted me with the sole copy of his will.

324
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,730
He instructed me to present it to you and
Tomomi on your birthdays this year.

325
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,650
Dad's will?

326
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:13,530
Yes. It includes Tomomi-sama, and it's
a joint will encompassing both of you.

327
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,490
A joint will? But why?

328
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,790
What are'you doing?

329
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,000
If you do as I tell you, I'll see to
it that you keep this house.

330
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,880
What are you doing?

331
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,760
If you just do as I say, everything will go well.

332
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,730
Amy...

333
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,100
I'm not Amy!

334
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,150
Amy. Be a good girl.

335
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,230
Your body belongs to me.

336
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,280
Stop it!

337
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,330
Little liar. You know you like it.

338
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,250
Amy, I know you think about this all the time.

339
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,920
Night and day.

340
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,170
Just stop it.

341
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,420
Amy... Amy...

342
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,010
Don't... Don't call me Amy!

343
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,220
Amy, let me make you feel even better.

344
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,400
Onee-chan, I'm here!

345
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,230
Tomomi-kun! Don't leave me!

346
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,820
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

347
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,200
I won't go anywhere.

348
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,540
Listen, I'm gonna take care of you.

349
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,880
Onee-chan...

350
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:36,190
yuugure omachikado tatazumu kousaten
On the street corner at sunset, I stand at a stop light.

351
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:44,200
yume miteru kibun de yukkuri arukou
I feel like dreaming a little, so I decide to walk slowly.

352
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:51,460
anata no mae ni iru watashi wa itsumo
The me you see before your eyes is always

smiling, as far as you know. But it's not true.

354
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,640
Don't call me Amy.

355
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,770

On night when I feel like I'm about to cry.

356
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,310

357
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:18,440

I want you to see me for who I really am.

358
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,990
Don't call me Amy.

359
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,780
mayonaka no heya ni hitori de iru to
When I'm alone in my room in the middle of the night,

00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,660

I'm always thinking that I want to look at you.

362
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,380
Don't call me Amy.
