1
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,291
Brother.

2
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:41,514
How did it go, Mr. Suzusaki?

3
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:44,715
It wasn't good.

4
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:46,617
I got the immigration
department's help...

5
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:48,554
to investigate departure records
for the past month...

6
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,492
but there's no records
on Nezu and Nozomi.

7
00:01:57,098 --> 00:01:59,396
Please don't give up, brother.

8
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:00,658
Thanks.

9
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:30,626
Half Acre Mansion.

10
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:32,557
Half Acre Mansion?

11
00:02:36,537 --> 00:02:40,303
Don't misunderstand me!
I protected Asuka from Nezu.

12
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:41,772
What do you mean by that?

13
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:47,139
He said Satoshi disturbed a very
important ceremony in America...

14
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:48,648
six years ago.

15
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:51,310
Nezu held a big grudge
against Satoshi.

16
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,714
Why did he take Nozomi?

17
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:59,015
He told me that he needed Nozomi
for the "family circle."

18
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:02,452
You saw it, too.

19
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,160
Nezu uses strange magic.

20
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:07,801
Nezu... Family Circle...

21
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:09,196
The Night of Beltane...

22
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,735
The state of Maine in America...

23
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:13,363
and the Half Acre Mansion.

24
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:17,910
But, that's the place...

25
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:21,671
Yes, the place where
I lost my memory...

26
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:25,076
and where your parents
bodies were found.

27
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,383
The key to this incident
is in my lost memory.

28
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,855
Nezu and Nozomi must be there too.

29
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,527
Wow, this is great!

30
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:49,761
This is making me dizzy.

31
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:53,737
Why are you going to
Half Acre Mansion?

32
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,702
Can't we stay there?

33
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:59,308
I asked at the airport and confirmed
the place is registered as a hotel.

34
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,275
The owner changed
a few years ago.

35
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:06,045
Now it's a bar and lodge, but...

36
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:08,354
Is there something dangerous?

37
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:10,889
No, it's not, but...

38
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:11,890
But?

39
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:16,553
It's just not a place where
foreign tourists stay.

40
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,060
I stayed there a long time ago.

41
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:43,221
All right, let's go.

42
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:54,967
What's wrong, Chief?

43
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:56,932
Oh, nothing.

44
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,243
Hello?

45
00:06:10,284 --> 00:06:12,047
Is anybody here?

46
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:14,277
What do you want?

47
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:19,288
Well, are you the manager?

48
00:06:21,362 --> 00:06:26,231
No, we don't operate here
in that kind of way.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

49
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:27,491
Who are you?

50
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:30,336
I'm just a freeloader.

51
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:35,404
The owner of this place is
fixing the backyard door.

52
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:36,803
Satoshi?!

53
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:38,307
Bill!

54
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:40,639
Big Bill!
Is that you?!
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

55
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,814
Satoshi! Satoshi!

56
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:48,678
I've never even dreamed that
I would ever see you again.

57
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:50,190
I... I can't breathe!
Let me go, Bill!

58
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:53,257
Oh, I'm sorry.

59
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:55,589
I got so excited, I couldn't take
my hands off of you.

60
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:57,025
You haven't changed at all.

61
00:06:57,064 --> 00:06:58,224
How long has it been?

62
00:06:58,332 --> 00:06:59,424
Four years.

63
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,491
Are you the owner of this place?

64
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:03,366
Yes, I'm the owner.

65
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:05,098
What happened to your job
as a newspaper journalist?

66
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,130
I quit two years ago.

67
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:10,877
Six years ago, after I was involved
with that incident...

68
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:16,175
my company felt very uncomfortable
keeping me on as a journalist.

69
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:17,381
I see.

70
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:21,683
So I quit and used my retirement
bonus to buy this place.

71
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:23,683
But, why did you have
to buy this place?

72
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:25,423
I don't know.

73
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:29,188
Somehow my mind has
strong ties with this place.

74
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,527
I lost my memory, but something
is telling me to stay here.

75
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:36,127
Memory?

76
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:40,105
Hey, Satoshi. Why don't you
introduce me to these ladies?

77
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:43,566
This is Haruka Sakimizu...

78
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:46,478
and this is my assistant,
Asuka Kashiwagi.

79
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,013
Kashiwagi?

80
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:49,049
Yes.

81
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:52,844
This is one of my best sources of
information from the old days...

82
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,314
and also my best
friend, Bill Toargia.

83
00:07:56,857 --> 00:07:59,087
Bill said that he also
lost his memory.

84
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:03,858
Bill lost his memory after the murders
that happened here six years ago.

85
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:05,962
After Nora's death.

86
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,368
Nora?

87
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:14,170
Let's all talk about this later.

88
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:16,071
Bill, do you have rooms for us?

89
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:17,804
Yes, plenty.

90
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:20,572
Then we'll stay here.
Let's talk at dinner.

91
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:22,772
All right.
I'll take you to your room.

92
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:35,457
I understand what you said, but I
haven't seen that man or the girl...

93
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:36,793
in the past month.

94
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:38,123
I see.

95
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,767
River Banks is a small town.

96
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:48,438
People would talk if a middle-age
Japanese man and a girl visited here.

97
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,609
I guess so.

98
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:55,405
The only Japanese person who's
in town, except for you guys, is...

99
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,210
Oh, new guests must be here.

100
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:01,211
Is Rumiko.

101
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:02,447
Me?

102
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,182
It's nothing.

103
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:06,451
But it's good timing.
I'll introduce you.

104
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:08,961
Rumiko Higuchi, she's a
student from Japan.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

105
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,289
Nice to meet you.

106
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:13,700
And her friend, Kate.

107
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:18,533
This is my best friend Satoshi.

108
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:20,900
And this is Asuka and Haruka.

109
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:22,233
Nice to meet you.

110
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:24,201
What's going on, Bill?

111
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:27,139
You have new guests?

112
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:32,445
Let me introduce Amy
and her boyfriend Clark.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

113
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:35,753
He's my best friend.

114
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:39,057
A historical site scholar?

115
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,126
Yes, he said there's some important
historical spot around here.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

116
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,998
He came here from
Germany four weeks ago.

117
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:47,031
I see.

118
00:09:47,268 --> 00:09:48,496
He is a very quiet man.

119
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:50,332
Is that all of your guests?

120
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:52,929
Yes, we also have old-man Louis.

121
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:55,837
He must be drinking at
the bar in the town now.

122
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:13,188
Don't get excited for that woman!

123
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:15,418
Asuka! I'm not...

124
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:20,063
Both of you don't act like
father and daughter...

125
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,861
or brother and sister,
but just like a couple.

126
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:24,870
N... no way! Impossible...

127
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:26,030
Impossible...?!

128
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:27,471
What's impossible?!

129
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,168
Well, nothing.

130
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:34,108
I guess you're very weak
in front of Asuka.

131
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:36,941
Keep out of this!
And thanks for the meal.

132
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,646
Bill, is the bar open?

133
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,984
Yes, unless I go to sleep.

134
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:45,853
Asuka... Sakimizu,
please rest well tonight.

135
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:47,993
We'll start investigating
tomorrow morning.

136
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:48,989
Yes.

137
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:49,958
Yes.

138
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:54,533
Haruka, please don't be sad.
I'm sure we can find Nozomi.

139
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:56,796
I think so, too.

140
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:06,505
Oh? It's self-service?

141
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:10,509
Yes, you drink by yourself
and leave the money.

142
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:14,185
Bill is the only person who's
taking care of this lodge.

143
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:16,316
He can't manage everything.

144
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,258
Would you like something to drink?

145
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,057
Can I have the same drink as her?

146
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:24,520
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:32,765
Gin and tonic.

148
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:34,205
Thank you.

149
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:39,444
I don't have any change.

150
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,771
Then I'll treat you guys, too.

151
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,516
Oh, you're a very generous old man!

152
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,641
Old man! You look cool.
You're my type.

153
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:49,415
Don't call me "old man."
I'm only twenty-eight.

154
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,525
See! You are an old man.

155
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:57,457
Ms. Higuchi, what
are you studying here?

156
00:11:57,798 --> 00:11:59,425
Call me Rumiko, old man!

157
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,395
My major is mystic studies.

158
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:04,630
It's very hard to find a place to
study that kind of thing in Japan.

159
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,397
Mystic studies?

160
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,534
Yes, I'm getting a
doctorate degree soon.

161
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:14,045
After that, I'll start working as an
instructor at Miskatonic University.

162
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:15,505
Really?

163
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:20,748
Yes it's true. Rumiko already has a
Master's Degree in mystic studies...

164
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:23,919
and just finished her
doctoral dissertation.

165
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:25,652
Well, she must be a good student.

166
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:27,087
Necronomicon.

167
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:28,290
What?

168
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:30,329
It's my dissertation's title.

169
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:33,124
Necro... nomicon...

170
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:08,894
Nozomi, let me handle this.

171
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:23,513
P... please do it to me, Nozomi.

172
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:54,638
Nozomi?

173
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:47,763
Cute girl!

174
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:04,008
Poor girl! It's swollen and very red.

175
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:24,259
It's mysterious.

176
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:05,106
Hurry! Hurry!

177
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:08,373
I'll give this to you, too.
Then we'll become one.

178
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:57,553
Mina Shizui told me the
key words to save Nozomi.

179
00:16:57,698 --> 00:17:02,931
"The Night of Beltane" and the
"murders that happened six years ago."

180
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:05,662
Well, which one are you
gonna start with first?

181
00:17:06,273 --> 00:17:07,638
The first thing is...

182
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,043
Oh, this is the worst!

183
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,009
Don't complain! Bill was kind
enough to lend us his car...

184
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,314
that he's been using
since he was a student.

185
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:24,749
Mr. Suzusaki, why are
we going to the library?

186
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,552
Rumiko Higuchi gave me some hints
on where to investigate last night.

187
00:17:31,164 --> 00:17:32,563
So! Did you try to pick her up?

188
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,760
Idiot! Listen to this.

189
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:37,492
Rumiko's major is mystic studies.

190
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:39,232
M... mystic studies?

191
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:40,136
Yes.

192
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:42,806
Necronomicon.

193
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:47,780
What's wrong?
Old man, are you all right?

194
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:49,274
I... I'm all right.

195
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:54,184
By the way, since you're
studying mysticism...

196
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:57,917
Do you know anything
about the Night of Beltane?

197
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:01,557
Beltane... it's the day
before May Day.

198
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:03,492
Do you know about it?

199
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:07,758
Yes, the original meaning of
Beltane is "Fire's Shining Light."

200
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:10,267
What meaning does that day have?

201
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:13,531
According to the ancient Roman
calendar, May is the month of three.

202
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:16,132
Three interprets life,
growth and death.

203
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,005
Since ancient times, the Night
of Beltane is the best time...

204
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:23,311
to cast magic spells related to
life and death in all means.

205
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:29,113
It means...

206
00:18:29,156 --> 00:18:32,990
It means Nezu is planning to do
something using Nozomi...

207
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:36,689
...on the Night of Beltane,
the night of April 30.

208
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:49,599
May I be of help to you?

209
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,879
I want to look at the back issues
of the Daily Banks.

210
00:18:53,213 --> 00:18:58,207
Yes, you can take a look at the
microfilms with the computer.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

211
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:03,420
Asuka, Ms. Sakimizu, can you
research about Half Acre Mansion?

212
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,050
Also the previous owner, and his
whereabouts, carefully.

213
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:08,794
Half Acre Mansion?

214
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:13,357
It might have some
connection to Nezu.

215
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:14,961
What about you Suzusaki?

216
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:18,070
I'll research the
incident six years ago.

217
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:22,675
The murders, Nezu, Nozomi, and I
must be connected in some way.

218
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,568
I understand.

219
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:32,609
This is it.

220
00:19:32,953 --> 00:19:33,920
Nora.

221
00:19:33,954 --> 00:19:36,252
Bizarre Murder Case
A Caucasian woman, Japanese Professor, and his
wife found murdered at Half Acre Mansion.
The suspect is the murdered woman's boyfriend!?
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

222
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:37,620
This must be it.

223
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:44,891
May 1, before sunrise at the
Half Acre Mansion in River Banks...

224
00:19:45,665 --> 00:19:48,498
Miskatonic University Professor
Kashiwagi and his wife...

225
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:53,967
and a student, Nora Defarlane...
were found murdered.

226
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:55,974
A patrol officer found them.

227
00:19:56,409 --> 00:20:01,642
They searched and found two
unconscious men close to the scene...

228
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:09,582
They're planning to investigate
Satoshi Suzusaki, a private detective...

229
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:12,217
as a possible witness
when he recovers.

230
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:20,194
They lost their memory
about the day of the murder.

231
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,291
A medical specialist
will investigate them.

232
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:28,397
June 30: The River Banks
County Court accepted...

233
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:33,502
Satoshi Suzusaki's claim of
amnesia and released him.

234
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:43,852
July 2: Satoshi Suzusaki was sent
to the state mental hospital.

235
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:51,061
July 15: Marshal Perkins
investigates the cemetery...

236
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:53,327
where the suspects were found.

237
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:54,691
Cemetery...?

238
00:20:55,435 --> 00:21:00,338
According to Marshal Perkins, the
suspects were found one kilometer...

239
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:03,774
from the Half Acre Mansion,
where the murder took place.

240
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:26,024
Are you all right?

241
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:30,195
I feel dizzy.

242
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,735
I'm all right.

243
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:32,970
I'm Cindy.

244
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:33,665
What?

245
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,264
That's my name...

246
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:43,716
W... what...?

247
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,811
I was waiting for you.

248
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:48,081
Who are you?

249
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:55,421
I still haven't been paid for the
information I gave you back then.

250
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:56,721
It can't be!

251
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:08,023
I must have seen Nezu six years ago.

252
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:09,925
Ms. Sakimizu, what did you find out?

253
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:14,200
Yes, Half Acre Mansion was called
Herbert Mansion before.

254
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,199
Herbert West built it.

255
00:23:17,343 --> 00:23:20,403
He was a professor of the medical
department in Miskatonic University.

256
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:26,151
He came here with his assistant
after he quit the university in 1940.

257
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:29,551
Are there any pictures of him?

258
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:32,586
I found only one picture.

259
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,551
The person in the
middle is Herbert West.

260
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:44,002
What's the matter chief?!
We almost got into an accident!

261
00:23:44,404 --> 00:23:46,133
Asuka! Look at this!

262
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:48,570
That's...

263
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:50,637
Yes, Nezu.

264
00:23:51,511 --> 00:23:52,375
What?

265
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:56,314
What's this all about?
This picture is 50 years old.

266
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,914
I don't understand.

267
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:00,552
It might be just a
coincidental resemblance...

268
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:02,680
or somebody blood related to him.

269
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:06,585
It's possible, but under
the circumstances...

270
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,855
this is too good
to be a coincidence.

271
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:13,930
If this is really Nezu, then
he's already over 90 years old.

272
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:15,132
What?

273
00:24:15,235 --> 00:24:18,966
I told you that I saw
Nezu six years ago.

274
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:21,832
Some of my memories came back to me.

275
00:24:22,142 --> 00:24:23,109
What?

276
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:38,186
Miskatonic University hired me to
investigate Professor Kashiwagi...

277
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:40,317
and his wife six years ago.

278
00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:42,557
And, I remembered one other thing.

279
00:24:42,962 --> 00:24:46,625
One more thing I
was asked to investigate.

280
00:24:51,137 --> 00:24:55,073
Before Kashiwagi disappeared,
he told me on the telephone...

281
00:24:55,108 --> 00:24:58,373
that he discovered something very
important, which can even disprove...

282
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:00,402
history and modern science.

283
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,769
Really?

284
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:04,074
He said he found the
Necronomicon.

285
00:25:04,284 --> 00:25:05,546
Necronomicon?

286
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:10,179
I want you to find out where Kashiwagi
is and about the Necronomicon.

287
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:14,257
Necronomicon?

288
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:18,387
And I heard the same word yesterday.

289
00:25:18,464 --> 00:25:19,226
What?

290
00:25:19,432 --> 00:25:21,593
Rumiko Higuchi...

291
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:25,335
She said she was
studying the Necronomicon.

292
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:29,373
I may be able to solve all
the mysteries if I ask her.

293
00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:32,643
Only three more days left
until the Night of Beltane.

294
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:35,270
Yes, we have very little time.

295
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:59,571
Suzusaki, it's you again.

296
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,431
Marshal Perkins.

297
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:03,165
What happened?

298
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:04,710
Murder.

299
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:11,750
Rumiko and Kate were killed!

300
00:26:12,218 --> 00:26:13,014
What?!

301
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:16,216
But how, I can't even
begin to describe.

302
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:32,972
Don't come in!

303
00:26:34,674 --> 00:26:36,107
Cut them down!

304
00:26:39,412 --> 00:26:41,039
This is the same as it
was six years ago.

305
00:26:41,514 --> 00:26:46,474
People die every time you show
up in this peaceful town.

306
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:55,521
You're an important witness.
I have some questions to ask you.

307
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,779
It can't be!

308
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,687
They were dead!

309
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,825
Their hearts had completely stopped!!

310
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,467
It's the same!

311
00:27:38,638 --> 00:27:40,629
It's the same as last time!

312
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:44,573
This is not what a human could do!
