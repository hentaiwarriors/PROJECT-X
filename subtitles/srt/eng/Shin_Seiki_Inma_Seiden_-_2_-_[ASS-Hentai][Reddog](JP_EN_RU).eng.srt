1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,689
Here's one.

2
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:41,549
How dare you...

3
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,160
How dare you kill Sena!

4
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:21,151
Inma Seiden

5
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:29,390
The earthquake near Ponape Island
in the South Pacific...

6
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:33,229
...caused damage throughout
the coastal area of the Pan-Pacific region.

7
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,758
The extent of damage
is yet to be confirmed.

8
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:42,035
The government issued a warning
regarding aftershocks and tidal waves...

9
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:53,047
How is Mao?

10
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,183
She should be good
and has gone to school today.

11
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,755
She seemed quite shocked
by Miss Yamamoto's death.

12
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,288
This incident caused trouble for you...

13
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:06,491
...the Main Family, Kaori.

14
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:12,538
Sena Yamamoto has transferred
to another school, will that do?

15
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:14,372
Aunt Himiko?

16
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:20,808
By the way, there's a rumor that a
Forbidden Ritual is being performed lately.

17
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:24,615
Auntie, please make sure
not to get involved.

18
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:27,585
You could get burnt.

19
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,383
Sagawa called.

20
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:35,453
He's found a girl he thinks is a Sheath.

21
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:40,723
Place our deity Dakiniten
at the Temple in the World Without Color.

22
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:43,393
That should be our priority.

23
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:45,031
Besides...

24
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:50,404
You can't. Mr. Sagawa, the class...

25
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:54,838
Who cares? We don't have
a music class first period.

26
00:03:58,285 --> 00:03:59,684
Oh, no.

27
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,655
Are you hot already, Reiko?

28
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:11,289
- Your undies are wet.
- No!

29
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,930
You're so mean.

30
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:22,966
No, not there.

31
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:28,571
You're so cute.

32
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,316
Mr. Sagawa!

33
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:41,053
I love you, I love you.

34
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:45,727
Aggressive, aren't you, Reiko?

35
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,124
Mr. Sagawa...

36
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,534
Mt. Shumi floats
in the Ocean of Fragrant Water.

37
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,170
The 33 Heavenly Buddhas
are easily affected.

38
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:00,673
The human world that we live in...

39
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:04,681
Moeka knows nothing.

40
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:11,513
- Not even that Sena is dead.
- Miss Ohtori!

41
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,423
Is my lecture that boring?

42
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:16,892
Mao.

43
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:21,491
Mr. Yashagami. I can't follow your lecture.

44
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:23,998
I am excusing myself.

45
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,607
What can I say?

46
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:41,610
You look delicious.

47
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:46,015
No. Mother.

48
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:52,457
Mother? I just ate her a little while ago.

49
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,507
What a laugh!

50
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:10,881
The livelier ones are worth eating, but...

51
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:13,814
...I will rape you first!

52
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:25,660
Listen, Hitomi!

53
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:29,524
You're my woman. Don't forget that.

54
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:32,129
You poor thing.

55
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:35,566
Now that my sister Erika's
Energy Sheild has disappeared...

56
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:38,440
...a monster like that
could take advantage of you.

57
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:42,746
You're my daughter from today forward.

58
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,049
Okay?

59
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,283
Mother.

60
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,763
Hey, Hitomi, the class has already started.

61
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:09,036
So good.

62
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,774
Please give it to me. I can't stand it.

63
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:17,606
Do you want it that badly, Reiko?

64
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:23,816
I want it. I want it. I'm going crazy.

65
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:29,058
What do you do when you want it?

66
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:31,659
Please, hurry.

67
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:37,667
You're coming inside me.

68
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:46,007
So nice, Mr. Sagawa.

69
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,274
More.

70
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,880
Mr. Sagawa!

71
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:04,694
I can't.

72
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,628
No, no, no.

73
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,944
She's all yours now.

74
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:36,052
Hey, let me rape you, all right, Hitomi?

75
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:38,654
Don't tease me.

76
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:45,697
What happened, Bonno?
Is Hitomi being mean to you?

77
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:48,972
Mao!

78
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,306
Don't spoil him too much, will you?

79
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:54,903
Hitomi, I have something to ask you.

80
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:57,947
Who summoned that Iron Mask?

81
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:00,718
You know something, don't you?

82
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,352
- You want to know?
- Yes.

83
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:05,582
I don't know either.

84
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,658
But you know Sena is dead.

85
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:10,654
Don't make fun of me!

86
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:16,557
I saved you from the Iron Mask for Mother.

87
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,133
Otherwise...

88
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,037
I might have killed you.

89
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,343
Bonno!

90
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,610
Mao is shaken. Seize this moment!

91
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:34,980
I will take care of this, Sagawa!

92
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:37,554
Yes sir, I'll handle Hitomi!

93
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:43,188
I won't let women like Himiko
and Kaori boss me around anymore.

94
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:53,701
You don't look well, Miss Mao.
What's wrong?

95
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:55,736
I'm fine, Suzune.

96
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,442
Now, I'm focusing.

97
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:10,751
What?

98
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,989
Energy Shield? Who is it?

99
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:19,721
Blossom Fire Arrow!

100
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:41,015
Come, Third King!

101
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:53,363
No way.

102
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,313
I've got you!

103
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,786
Captain! Miss Mao!

104
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:26,328
Miss Mao, get a hold of yourself.
What's wrong?

105
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,901
Don't worry, I just got dizzy.

106
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:31,630
But...

107
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:34,002
You worry too much, Suzune.

108
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:36,333
What was with that fox?

109
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:39,042
Who is it?

110
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:41,304
Mr. Yashagami.

111
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:44,773
I slipped and fell.

112
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:50,053
Hitomi, I think you know this, but...

113
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:53,490
...you are spending
too much time with Mao.

114
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:56,058
I did it for you, Mother.

115
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:59,559
Don't you see?
This is too dangerous for you.

116
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:02,226
Please let Oasa and the others handle this.

117
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:04,064
You have to stay in this school...

118
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:05,661
I shouldn't worry?

119
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:06,898
What?

120
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:09,703
Shouldn't I worry about you, Mother?

121
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:11,776
What do you say?

122
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:16,606
Go home now.

123
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:21,016
I have my club, so I'll be late.

124
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:24,148
Gloomy old bitch!

125
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:28,426
Hitomi...

126
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:30,825
Mr. Yashagami.

127
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,897
What's up, the two of you?

128
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:36,093
I heard you got hurt, so...

129
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,498
I'm sorry.

130
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:40,663
Thank you for your concern.

131
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,636
It's nothing.

132
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:48,975
If you touch Moeka,
you won't get away with it.

133
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:51,983
I wouldn't do anything to trouble My Lady.

134
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,047
- Shouldn't you rest some more?
- I'm fine.

135
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:58,815
I will walk you to the teachers' lounge.

136
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,227
Oh, well.

137
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:09,894
Maybe you have some idea
how Mr. Yashagami was injured.

138
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:13,136
No, I don't.

139
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:40,697
What's that?

140
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,497
Miss Kaori, anything wrong?

141
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:46,595
I'm sorry, I'm not feeling too good.

142
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:48,970
Please continue with the meeting.

143
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:52,934
Then let's hear from you
about the recent rumor about...

144
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,879
...the mysterious Iron Mask
and his identity...

145
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:57,976
This is the second time.

146
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,051
On!

147
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:12,691
Two.

148
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:18,265
Looks like we're too late. I think
this is Miss Reiko Koga of the Tennis Club.

149
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:21,072
- She's the second victim.
- Yes.

150
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:27,007
Let's give it a try, Bodai.

151
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,537
Now I see.

152
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:04,447
This Kanzeon Temple is connected
underground to the Peacock Temple.

153
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,451
The Temple of the Peacock God?

154
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:10,350
The place where Miss Yamamoto
was sacrificed just the other day.

155
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:14,923
I still cannot fathom
what Aunt Himiko is planning.

156
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:19,055
Once, I might have to
get into the Great Cathedral.

157
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:26,027
This happens every time I summon you.

158
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:31,876
Should I be your partner?

159
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:33,912
No. I can hold it.

160
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:45,151
But now that things
have advanced this far...

161
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:48,785
...I might need to probe into it.

162
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:54,627
Rikako. Rikako.

163
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:57,131
Pull her out of there now!

164
00:15:57,203 --> 00:16:00,001
Idiot! No!

165
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:03,636
Don't take away my Rikako!

166
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,010
We need to find another girl
to give him as Miss Rikako.

167
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:10,512
I have an idea for that.

168
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:15,744
Don't go away, Rikako.

169
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:20,491
Rikako. My Sister.

170
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:25,796
Miss Matsumoto is so persistent,
but I don't know anything.

171
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:29,528
But, Akira...

172
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:39,644
I hope nothing happens
to My Lady while I am asleep.

173
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:53,389
Why does Akira show up
whenever I am in danger?

174
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:59,562
I've been living with him
ever since I was a little child.

175
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:02,426
And yet I know nothing about him.

176
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:05,131
Sis.

177
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:09,201
It's not good for you
to stay in hot water too long.

178
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:12,073
It's been a long while
since I bathed with you.

179
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:23,278
You and I and Hitomi used to
enjoy baths together when we were young.

180
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:26,052
Hitomi saved me.

181
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:27,689
I know.

182
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,126
But you can't take risks like that.

183
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:31,629
Sena is dead!

184
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:33,028
Mao!

185
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:36,935
They might come after you.

186
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:40,364
I beg you, don't make me worry.

187
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:43,573
We're the only family we have.

188
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,135
Hey, Sis.

189
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:49,379
What would I do
if anything happened to you...

190
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:50,909
No!

191
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:54,583
Mao.

192
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:05,091
Look what she does at school at night.

193
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:07,496
I just don't get what she does.

194
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:10,625
How is it? Did you break a record?

195
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:13,263
Do you enjoy tormenting yourself
that much?

196
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:16,133
Why don't you do what you like?

197
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,975
For example, if you want to kill Mao...

198
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:21,308
...l'll give you a hand
whenever you're ready!

199
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,708
Hitomi!

200
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,345
Are you practicing this late?

201
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,887
What's with you? You're flushed.

202
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:31,684
Am I? Must be because I ran.

203
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:36,917
You aren't trying
to do something dangerous again?

204
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,759
What's wrong with that?

205
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:42,797
Do whatever you like!

206
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:46,334
Some irreconcilable differences
they've got!

207
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:48,769
Just the two of them.

208
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:52,904
I should get them to be my prisoners now.

209
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,985
I knew this would happen!

210
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:08,651
It's not my fault.

211
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:18,703
They're coming.

212
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:41,824
Hitomi!

213
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:49,357
- Why did you save me?
- Because you're slow!

214
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:51,929
Great Commander King!

215
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,648
My Lady!

216
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:14,019
No!

217
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:16,053
Mao!

218
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:21,056
Don't touch my girl!

219
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:25,799
Stop!

220
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:29,668
No!

221
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:34,144
Stop it!

222
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:40,677
It hurts.

223
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:52,628
What?

224
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:00,934
Stop it.

225
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:02,901
No.

226
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:11,510
No!

227
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:24,822
It hurts! Stop!

228
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:33,937
Stop!

229
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:47,683
Mao!

230
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:49,786
Stop it.

231
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:52,518
Stop.

232
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:54,556
Don't!

233
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:58,396
It hurts.

234
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,100
It hurts!

235
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:04,995
You're ripping me apart!

236
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:07,736
Don't!

237
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:10,831
Mao...

238
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:13,207
It hurts! No!

239
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:18,141
No, you're breaking me.

240
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:23,417
I don't want it!

241
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:36,866
No more.

242
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:51,474
How easily she came.

243
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,447
At this rate,
I might be able to rule this world.

244
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:58,355
Next, Great Commander King!

245
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:09,798
No!

246
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:12,136
Don't!

247
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:14,839
Hitomi!

248
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:31,983
What?

249
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,295
She's mine!

250
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:05,918
Hitomi, I've been waiting for this day!

251
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,790
I will rape you here, now!

252
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,135
Damn! I was so close.

253
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:23,100
I will rape you! Don't forget that.

254
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:31,549
I'm sorry to have asked you out
this late, Mr. Oasa.

255
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:36,046
No, no, when the Main Family
summons me, time is of no importance.

256
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:38,781
What can I do for you?

257
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:42,691
Well.

258
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:48,189
I'm so hot tonight, I can't go to sleep.

259
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:50,263
I wonder why.

260
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:54,335
Well. That's beyond me...

261
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:01,474
Miss Kaori...

262
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,379
Whatever you are planning to do
with Aunt Himiko...

263
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,748
...I would like to know all the details.

264
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,688
But I'm sure...

265
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:14,123
...you won't honestly tell me
what I want to know.

266
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,521
I...

267
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:25,527
So I borrowed the spider from Akira and...

268
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:28,698
...played a little trick on you.

269
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:34,044
Now you will tell me everything you know.
