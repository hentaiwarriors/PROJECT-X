1
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,265
Give me power!

2
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:59,178
Fine...

3
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,844
Give me power!

4
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,445
More! More!

5
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,469
Power, give me power.

6
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:59,965
<i>Black Gate, Gate 2</i>

7
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:18,687
What the hell is going on?

8
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,366
Who are these people?

9
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,229
Everyone, get inside!

10
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,280
Who is that girl?

11
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:45,613
I'm not really sure.

12
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,660
We're not making any progress.

13
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,628
If we could get rid
of just a few of them...

14
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,368
What's wrong?

15
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,526
I don't know.

16
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,764
I had no idea you'd
come over this quickly.

17
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:13,301
I thought you'd get permission
from the elders first.

18
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,308
Shizuku!

19
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,044
Narifumi.

20
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,949
Shizuku, come back with us.

21
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,114
It's not too late...

22
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:27,659
If you want to take me back,
you'll have to do it by force.

23
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,657
Shizuku...

24
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,266
But if you get in my way, I'll kill you.

25
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:40,938
Why?

26
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,735
You'll never understand.

27
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,442
Earthquake!

28
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,449
The gate...

29
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,569
The gate is out of control.

30
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,579
What should we do?

31
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,481
They are still in this realm.

32
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,089
Then...

33
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,018
Find them!

34
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:05,222
Certainly!

35
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,402
That young woman...

36
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,244
What the hell is going on?

37
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,319
Explain so I can understand it.

38
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,751
Sorry, we don't really know either.

39
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,556
What?

40
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:43,795
All we know is what we've gathered
from the old teachings we've been told.

41
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,032
Teachings? What are those?

42
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,531
What I want to know is...

43
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,291
Calm down, Hosokawa!

44
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,397
Ma'am.

45
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:56,807
We'll tell you what we know, but
we can't do any more than that.

46
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,306
We are guardians of the gate.

47
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,582
Guardians of the gate?

48
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,313
You saw the gate too.

49
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,822
That is called the Black Gate.

50
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:17,322
It connects the world we
were in before to this world.

51
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:21,093
Our world and this world?

52
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:27,096
Yes, this is a different
world than the one we live in.

53
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,508
That's ridiculous.

54
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,769
How can that be?

55
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,337
It's true.

56
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:42,188
In the past, this world had people living
in it, it had a culture, and a history.

57
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:43,582
But...

58
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:52,828
They accidentally discovered
an incredible power.

59
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:57,032
...strong enough to destroy themselves.

60
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:06,074
The few remaining people chose
our world as their new home.

61
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,881
...and so they built the Black Gate.

62
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:15,715
The Kadomori family are descendants
of those who came over from this side.

63
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:24,230
They have been protecting
the gate this whole time.

64
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,029
Protecting it?

65
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,326
From what?

66
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,369
The power that destroyed this world.

67
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,167
This power known as "The
Power to Rule the World"...

68
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,806
...can also destroy the
world that we live in.

69
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:42,877
So we've sealed that power on this
side and have guarded the gate...

70
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,348
...so that it would not be opened.

71
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,851
The power to rule the world?

72
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,050
Yes.

73
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:53,558
It is said that if you have that
power, you can control the world.

74
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:57,694
There are no teachings on
what those powers may be...

75
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,728
...so we're not really sure, but...

76
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:00,924
I had no idea.

77
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,697
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

78
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:08,773
I'm here on this side, but it
still doesn't seem real to me.

79
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,470
But if you think about what's going
on, there's no choice but to believe it.

80
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:18,075
So everyone here is a
guardian of the gate?

81
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:18,842
Yes.

82
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,819
Kasumi Kadomori...

83
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,252
...Mizuki Komiyama...

84
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,483
...and me, Nanami Ebizuka,
you know who we are.

85
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,658
This is Miharu Fujisaki.

86
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:32,596
She's the student body president
so I know what she looks like but...

87
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,524
Koyuki Hasegawa and Fuu Katsuragi.

88
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,569
They are both a year ahead of you.

89
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,001
And Amane Izumi.

90
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,335
She's one year below you.

91
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:47,512
The Kadomori power has been
passed down through the women.

92
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:52,607
The seven of us plus Shizuku makes
eight, and we are the guardians.

93
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,281
Shizuku...

94
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,149
Why did she do that?

95
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,617
She's trying to acquire
the power to rule the world.

96
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:05,425
For a guardian of the gate to try
something like this is the greatest sin.

97
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,762
But she's trying to get it, nonetheless.

98
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,468
What happened to her?

99
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,239
I don't understand why, either.

100
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,775
Miss Nanami, this girl,
what's wrong with her?

101
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,133
I don't know.

102
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,609
What's your name?

103
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:22,640
Sora.

104
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:47,939
Kasumi.

105
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:50,473
What's wrong?

106
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,180
Oh, nothing...

107
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,496
I'm sorry to drag you into this.

108
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:11,895
Don't worry about it.

109
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,156
Shizuku...

110
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,085
...she liked you.

111
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,626
But I was the one going out with you.

112
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:53,102
I knew how she felt.

113
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,845
But she was happy for me, and I
believed that everything was okay.

114
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,739
But it wasn't okay.

115
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,578
That's why Shizuku...

116
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,384
That's not true...

117
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,621
Narifumi...

118
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:18,563
...if you had enough power to do
anything you wanted with this world...

119
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:19,858
...what would you do?

120
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,397
Don't say that.

121
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,501
You're saying that Shizuku's
trying to get back at you.

122
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,841
There's no way that's true.

123
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,608
You're twins.

124
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,778
You grew up together.

125
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,808
You know her better than anyone.

126
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,643
She wouldn't think anything like that.

127
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,249
Right?

128
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,181
Yeah.

129
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,378
Here goes.

130
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,168
Okay.

131
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,014
Did it hurt?

132
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,020
I'm okay.

133
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,183
You can move it.

134
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,444
Narifumi! Narifumi!

135
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,360
Wow!

136
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,399
I'm going to lose my mind.

137
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,580
Kasumi, I'm going to come.

138
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,684
Yes, come, Narifumi.

139
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:13,426
Narifumi...

140
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,924
I'm so happy.

141
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,032
How can you be so complacent?

142
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,033
You say it like it would be easy
to find someone in this big world.

143
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,842
Mizuki.

144
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,413
I can't deal with this.

145
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,981
I'm going back.

146
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,845
Wait.

147
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,008
Leave me alone.

148
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,280
Listen, the gate isn't stable right now.

149
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,319
It's not safe to go through it.

150
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:14,084
Yeah, well it's your fault for
breaking your concentration before.

151
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:18,220
And that's not it, this whole thing
is you and your sister's fault.

152
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,765
Why do I have to be put through this?

153
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,832
Calm down.

154
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:23,532
Don't touch me!

155
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,898
W-What!

156
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,279
There's no reason to cry...

157
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,457
Miss President...

158
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,757
What's wrong? This isn't like you.

159
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,135
Then what am I like?

160
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,667
Um...

161
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,005
I've held myself back...

162
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,738
...to be a top student, to
meet people's expectations.

163
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,042
I've had enough.

164
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,549
I've decided to be true to myself.

165
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,745
It's great to be true but...

166
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,581
Right?

167
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:16,447
So...

168
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,014
These are my true feelings.

169
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:20,854
Hey!

170
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,188
I like you.

171
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,355
I don't want Kasumi or Shizuku
or anyone else to have you.

172
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,092
Miss President.

173
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,205
Miss President.

174
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,181
Don't think of anyone other than me.

175
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,921
So? Has anyone ever done this for you?

176
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,057
Well...

177
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,095
I can't hold it anymore...

178
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,415
It's okay, come.

179
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:43,101
I'm sorry, Miss President, but...

180
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,268
I'm sorry!

181
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,707
Hosokawa!

182
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,810
Even if I'm true to myself...

183
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,510
It's not worth it.

184
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,457
Why are you here?

185
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:01,618
Well...

186
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,156
Now it's time for fun.

187
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,837
You look good, Mizuki.

188
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,334
Let's begin.

189
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,811
We wouldn't want anyone to catch us.

190
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,653
He's going to enter you.

191
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:33,751
Does it hurt?

192
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:34,723
I bet it hurts.

193
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,988
You don't seem like
you've played around much.

194
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,829
Does it make you mad?

195
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:47,270
There's nothing as demoralizing
as experiencing your powerlessness.

196
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:50,806
No matter what you say, no
matter how you justify it...

197
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,074
...unless you have the power to put it
in to action, it doesn't mean anything.

198
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,745
That's right, power is everything.

199
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,512
Say something.

200
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,126
Are you enjoying this?

201
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,531
You are a freak.

202
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,266
You're enjoying it
under these conditions...

203
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,101
I am not enjoying it.

204
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,401
Stop lying.

205
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:28,645
It's embarrassing.

206
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:32,274
Become more free, be more honest.

207
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:35,285
You decided to live
that way, didn't you?

208
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:26,332
There's no place for you there.

209
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:31,207
Not the way things are now.

210
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:40,582
Don't you wish you had the power
to create a place for yourself?

211
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,691
Miss President.

212
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,602
What pretty flowers.

213
00:23:58,905 --> 00:23:59,337
Yeah.

214
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:02,235
There were a lot of them over there.

215
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,233
Wanna go pick some with me?

216
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:07,676
No.

217
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:09,948
No!

218
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,341
Miss President!

219
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:14,749
What are you doing?

220
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:15,087
Narifumi!

221
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,349
<i>Get back!</i>
Narifumi!

222
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,218
What are you planning to do with Sora?

223
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:21,721
I don't have any interest in her.

224
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,223
Shizuku.

225
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,221
We're taking the girl.

226
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,640
Goodbye, Miss Nanami.

227
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,190
Not again.

228
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:09,863
Everyone, to the shrine.

229
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:10,906
Wait!

230
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,259
Thank you.

231
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,236
It's okay.

232
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:43,874
Can you give me some
time alone with Hosokawa?

233
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,910
Um, what is it?

234
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:58,751
I was born into a family of
guardians who handed down...

235
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:02,089
...all the knowledge of the
guardianship of the gate.

236
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:06,327
I'd like to hand this
knowledge over to you.

237
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,701
It will help you in
your battles to come.

238
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:13,296
Knowledge?

239
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,603
I don't have long.

240
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,567
Miss Ebizuka!

241
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,838
What are you going to do?

242
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,346
My everything...

243
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,549
I'm counting on you, Hosokawa.

244
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:38,994
You're the only one who
can keep the girls together.

245
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,090
I'm counting on you.

246
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:19,762
Miss Ebizuka!

247
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,237
Miss Ebizuka!
