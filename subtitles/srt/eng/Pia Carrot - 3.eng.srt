1
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,704
Satomi. How about this one?

2
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:41,449
Voilà!

3
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:48,955
That looks good on you. Cute.

4
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:53,694
I knew this would be good.

5
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:57,864
I'm getting this one for Okinawa.

6
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:03,095
Yusuke will like this one.

7
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,430
Yeah...

8
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:16,842
Thanks for waiting.

9
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:21,616
Did you find something, Shoko?

10
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:26,318
Perfecto. She chose something for you.

11
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:30,391
Who did you choose yours for?

12
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:35,165
Me? None of your business.

13
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:41,476
Hey, Shoko,
Rumi wants you to come spend the night.

14
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,707
Rumi said that? I'll be there!

15
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,091
Haven't shared bath with you in a while.

16
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:09,871
Right.

17
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,167
Hey, Shoko.

18
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:15,041
Yes?

19
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:21,949
You're looking beautiful these days.

20
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:25,552
Am I?

21
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:28,414
Ding ding!

22
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,451
I've got it.

23
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:37,429
Hey!

24
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:40,692
What're you doing?

25
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:44,766
Confess. Who is it?

26
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:55,315
Tell me, tell me. Is it someone I know?

27
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,312
I can't.

28
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:04,253
Which means...

29
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,192
Can't be Dad...

30
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,965
What?

31
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:16,235
My brother?

32
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,033
I've got it.

33
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:26,208
Shoko, don't worry about it.

34
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,816
I'm here for you.

35
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:36,456
Your love shall blossom!

36
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,966
Yusuke, don't give me a cold
before we go to Okinawa.

37
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:50,965
You mean?

38
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:54,765
You're coming, too, Kiyomi?

39
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:59,240
As a payment for tutoring you.

40
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,717
Something wonderful is going to happen
in Okinawa this summer.

41
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:22,299
Yusuke, do you like staring
at your cousin's underwear?

42
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,664
I do...

43
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:27,033
No. I don't.

44
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:29,841
Employee Okinawa Tour

45
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:34,576
I'm so happy.
We're all going to Okinawa together.

46
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,852
He's taking the entire Pia Carrot staff.

47
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,682
It's a big expense for the boss.

48
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:44,217
I want to show off my swimsuit to Yusuke.

49
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:47,257
Yeah. That'll be fun.

50
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:52,696
Satomi, of course you'll help me,
won't you?

51
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:55,534
Yes. Of course.

52
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:57,830
Let's get to work.

53
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,468
Boss. Good morning.

54
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:08,312
Good morning.

55
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:11,985
Oops!

56
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:14,055
Boss!

57
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:20,189
Hey, you two. Happy with your work?

58
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:34,402
<i>Excuse me.</i>

59
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:36,542
Yes.

60
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:41,513
About the shift change during the trip...

61
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:44,284
What?

62
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:47,449
Shiho, is everything all right?

63
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:51,916
Right. The shift change.

64
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,229
You're going to Okinawa, too, Yusuke?

65
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:58,790
Didn't I tell you?

66
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,834
Are you all right?

67
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:04,701
Right, right.

68
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:08,468
I'll be here. Bring back a souvenir.

69
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:26,151
<i>I wonder how Shiho is doing.</i>

70
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,865
<i>Satomi's acting weird, too.</i>

71
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:40,865
Me? None of your business.

72
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,146
Bro, stop your daydreaming.

73
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:49,784
Shut up, I'm thinking about
something serious.

74
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:54,479
You're thinking about girls again.

75
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,787
Kiyomi, Please.

76
00:07:58,027 --> 00:08:00,154
Yusuke, what's wrong?

77
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:03,792
No, no. It's nothing.

78
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:08,131
Shoko, stay away from dumb people.

79
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,097
Satomi, what are you saying?

80
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,906
Don't worry.

81
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:17,412
Just because you're dumb,
doesn't mean I'm going to dump you.

82
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:26,278
Bro, look. Look. Okinawa!

83
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:56,781
You are all free to do as you please
until dinner at 7:00. Have fun.

84
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:01,185
Yusuke, I need to talk to you.

85
00:09:02,524 --> 00:09:06,016
- What is it?
- Yusuke? What did you do this time?

86
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:10,225
- Yusuke, we'll be on the beach.
- I'll be right there.

87
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:21,206
Well, that's a surprise.

88
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,142
I didn't mean to hide it.

89
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:27,878
Are you happy for me?
I'm getting remarried.

90
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:30,517
Whoever she is.

91
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:35,019
It's for you to decide.

92
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,055
We'll talk more when we get back.

93
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,622
Later, then.

94
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,337
A stepmother.

95
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:18,025
Isn't Yusuke coming?

96
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,928
He's always slow.

97
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:23,765
There he is.

98
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:29,403
Yusuke, we're here! This way!

99
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:34,447
Hey.

100
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:37,379
Yusuke. What's wrong?

101
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,918
Guess it was a shock to him. He's young.

102
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:48,722
Don't worry. It's good for him, too.

103
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:53,126
Thanks for waiting.

104
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,004
Yusuke. You're here.

105
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:14,079
Yusuke, we got ourselves a boat.

106
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:17,751
Let's go to the island over there.

107
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,860
Let's go, Bro.

108
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,931
Yeah, why not?

109
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:43,576
- It's cold.
- What're you doing?

110
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,945
- Wait.
- Wait for me.

111
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:25,116
They're both kids, after all.

112
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:30,661
Really, I thought you liked kids.

113
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:35,361
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

114
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,108
What's up?

115
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:47,137
Nothing. It's just...
You're kinda pretty.

116
00:12:53,822 --> 00:12:54,948
Yusuke!

117
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,949
This road is rough, Shoko.

118
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:02,258
<i>You're not saying
you're bored with Shoko, are you?</i>

119
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:04,364
Calm down, Satomi.

120
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:07,869
No excuses now. You took her to a hotel.

121
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:09,765
To a hotel?

122
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:13,266
It's not like that. It was...

123
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:17,139
I will never forgive you
if you break Shoko's heart.

124
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:19,876
Hold on a second.

125
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:21,279
Bro.

126
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:24,247
What is this?

127
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:28,116
What did you do to Shoko?
Explain it to me.

128
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:31,982
Shoko.

129
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:35,185
Yusuke.

130
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:43,930
- I'm outta here.
- Satomi.

131
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,562
Satomi.

132
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:51,377
- Do as you please.
- Not you, Bro.

133
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,944
Satomi, it wasn't like that.

134
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:03,456
Don't worry. Stay with Yusuke.

135
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,082
But...

136
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:07,158
Yo, Bro.

137
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:10,854
- I don't care.
- Bro, you're idiot.

138
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:25,838
<i>- Satomi!
- Bro! Bro!</i>

139
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,544
Screw them.

140
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,453
Satomi.

141
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:52,665
Bro, Bro. Satomi's gone under.

142
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:56,811
What?

143
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,444
Satomi!

144
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:13,818
Satomi.

145
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:22,103
<i>Satomi, wake up.</i>

146
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,902
Hey, Satomi.

147
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:36,773
- She's awake.
- Satomi.

148
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:42,921
- Yusuke.
- Good. You're fine.

149
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:46,951
Satomi.

150
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,954
Yusuke.

151
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:03,004
Yusuke. Satomi.

152
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:30,904
<i>Satomi?</i>

153
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,834
Shoko? It's open.

154
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,407
Shoko.

155
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:54,894
I'm sorry, Satomi. I was...

156
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:02,102
I was just so happy and...

157
00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:07,136
What, anything wrong with Yusuke?

158
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:12,276
You know I went to a hotel with Yusuke.

159
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:15,777
Yeah, but...

160
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:17,478
You're mistaken.

161
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:22,884
I took him to the hotel. It wasn't his fault.

162
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,621
But you and Yusuke...

163
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:30,528
Nothing happened. Nothing.

164
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:38,338
It's just I adored Yusuke.

165
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,435
But now I know who he loves.

166
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,080
What?

167
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:51,549
I'm saying he loves someone else.

168
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:03,526
We have a problem. It's Satomi.

169
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,690
Satomi?

170
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,763
<i>I told her about us.</i>

171
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:15,309
<i>And she ran away.</i>

172
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:31,882
<i>Satomi!</i>

173
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:41,125
Satomi?

174
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:53,643
What? You thought I'd jump again?

175
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,116
Well, no.

176
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:06,156
I hate myself. Shoko told me everything.

177
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:12,028
- Everything?
- She was like, "He's yours!"

178
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:16,970
- And I was so happy.
- Satomi.

179
00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:27,947
I'm sorry, Shoko.

180
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:30,909
About Bro.

181
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:36,117
Don't worry.
I just had a crush on him, that's all.

182
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:41,353
Serves him right.
He was, like, totally panicked.

183
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:44,258
Was he?

184
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:54,535
Hey, Shoko, we're in Okinawa, after all.

185
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,244
Let's go find some men!

186
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:01,043
Yes. Let's.

187
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:05,847
<i>So that's our plan tomorrow.
Bro is like so boring.</i>

188
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,650
<i>Wow! It'll be fun.</i>

189
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,852
Satomi.

190
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:16,794
I'm sorry.

191
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:20,596
Thank you, Yusuke, for caring about me.

192
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:23,568
Satomi. I...

193
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:53,726
Satomi. I want to look at you.

194
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:58,801
Sorry. Are you upset?

195
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,801
Turn away.

196
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,344
Okay, Satomi.

197
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:21,919
Yusuke. Okay now.

198
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:38,040
Don't stare.

199
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:40,979
Don't be silly. You're beautiful, Satomi.

200
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

201
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:17,910
Satomi. Are you sure?

202
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:22,355
- Don't ask.
- I love you, Satomi.

203
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:24,218
Thank you.

204
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,434
What? Too rough?

205
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:49,715
- I don't know.
- Maybe you liked it.

206
00:22:49,784 --> 00:22:54,118
- Don't be crude.
- Relax, and let me.

207
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:11,034
- Hey. Yusuke, not there.
- I told you to let me.

208
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:14,274
Don't worry.

209
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,579
No, Yusuke. I'm embarrassed.

210
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:31,091
No, not that.

211
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,079
Satomi, you're cute.

212
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:12,861
I'm sorry. I don't know much.

213
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,534
It's my first time, too.

214
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:21,469
- I'll bear it. Okay?
- Satomi.

215
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,451
- All right?
- Yes. Fine. Go on.

216
00:24:42,463 --> 00:24:47,491
- I'm inside you, Satomi.
- So this is you. I'm happy.

217
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:52,438
- Does it hurt?
- No, just a little.

218
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:54,904
Let me move.

219
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:12,985
Satomi. I can't hold...

220
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:17,020
It's all right. Come inside me.

221
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,394
Satomi.

222
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:26,430
Yusuke.

223
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:44,657
It was wonderful, Satomi.

224
00:25:45,693 --> 00:25:47,490
I'm so happy.

225
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,125
Move, Bro, move.

226
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:25,028
It's about your turn.

227
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:28,159
No, remember the coin flip?
I'm going ahead.

228
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,597
Bastards.

229
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:42,176
I'm tired. Come help me.

230
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:44,744
Welcome home, Yusuke.

231
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:52,882
Shiho?

232
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:58,558
We need a new introduction, Yusuke.
This is your new mother, Shiho.

233
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,532
Pleased to meet you, Son.

234
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:05,071
My mom?

235
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:17,815
No! All our souvenirs!

236
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,988
Why this?
