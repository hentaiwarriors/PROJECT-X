1
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,030
The train will be arriving momentarily.

2
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,630
Please wait behind the yellow line.

3
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,090
Ever since I was a child, I hated winter.

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,670
I hated the cold winds and the falling snow.

~Winter Promise~ Part 1

8
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,930
I was born with a genetic breathing disorder called "AGGS".

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,550
We are starting the injections now.

10
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,400
Various medications, constant fevers.

11
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,480
Various physical conditions, leading to constant testing.

12
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,040
Ok, lastly, expand them for me.

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,040
And then there were these wings.

14
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,050
Ok. I think we're good.

15
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,620
That's the end of the testing for today. Well done, Chika-chan.

16
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,080
Doctor... About this data...

17
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,550
Chika-chan!

18
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,120
Thank you!

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,120
And these were the results.

20
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,750
Hey there!

21
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,110
Oh, Mayuki-san... Nice timing.

22
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,000
We just finished.

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,520
Oh, hey onee-chan!

24
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,000
Hurry up and change, you!

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,830
Yeah, yeah.

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,670
Man, how long are you gonna keep acting like a kid?

27
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,020
Urgh...

28
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,980
Get moving.

29
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,850
Mayuki-chan, you're looking a little pale.

30
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,950
Oh, really? Yeah, I haven't been getting much sleep, but I'm alright.

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,850
Well, I'm not worried. You're well taken care of at the dorm.

32
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,420
Ain't that the truth.

33
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:35,980
Hey, Onee-chan...

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:36,840
Hmm?

35
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,990
I'll be out front, ok?

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,360
Sure. Just don't catch a cold.

37
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,390
Ok...

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,240
...And? How is she?

39
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,900
I'd like to see her plateau out.

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,830
Plateau?

41
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,325
She continues to get small fluctuation in her abilities,

42
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:01,270
but in general she is far more stable than she used to be.

43
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,810
Is that so? Thank you so much.

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,740
Don't thank me. It's you that really got her this far.

45
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,020
I assure you, that isn't the case.

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,290
Good afternoon.

47
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,360
Good afternoon.

48
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,020
But honestly, in comparison to when you first brought her here...

49
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,720
She has really turned into a bright and happy young girl.

50
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,030
I think so too.

51
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,750
I wonder if Kosuke-kun might have helped too?

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,840
You might be right about that too.

53
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,620
Oh, that reminds me. I have something I'd like you to ask of Kosuke and the others.

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,650
Uh... Um...

55
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,290
Angel Class, TE1.

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,650
Oh? So you're like me.

57
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,090
This is the first time I've seen golden wings.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,440
I'm Listy C. Crawford.

59
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,060
I'm Chika. Nimura Chika.

60
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,230
Chika!

61
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,130
Onee-chan!

62
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,250
I was looking everywhere for you.

63
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,480
Oh, this is good timing... This is the one I was just telling you I'd like you to meet.

64
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,820
This is Tora-chan.

65
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,620
She looks like a very nice girl, don't you think?

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,045
Yep. She is getting treated at the same lab as Chika,

67
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:37,736
so they asked if she could stay here for a bit.

68
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,130
She doesn't have any family here, and hasn't stayed in a dorm before, so the doc asked me if it would be ok.

69
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,230
I see.

70
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,810
Well, if you want there is an open space on the second floor. I've been keeping it clean just in case.

71
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,490
Sounds good. I guess it will be occupied from now on.

72
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,320
Ok then. Chika!

73
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,420
What is it?

74
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,560
No, I just didn't realize it would work out so easily.

75
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,530
I see.

76
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,220
But I guess good food isn't the only thing that has gotten easier since Kosuke got here.

77
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,300
That's for sure.

78
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,450
I haven't seen those sad faces you used to have all the time in quite a while.

79
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,390
Don't be stupid. We were never like that.

80
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,660
Ai-onee-chan, thanks so much for letting Listy stay with us.

81
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,870
Well of course!

82
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,660
Well, Chika, do you want to help Listy settle in?

83
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:24,990
Yup!

84
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,780
Oh, that's right!

85
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,290
I forgot I promised I would hang out with Minami-chan in town today.

86
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,220
Well then why don't you take Listy with you?

87
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,180
She is going to need a guide to get around anyway.

88
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,510
Ok, be careful, you two.

89
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,210
Bring back some groceries for dinner, OK?

90
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,190
Ok! Well then, we're off!

91
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,400
See you later!

92
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,370
Mayuki-san?

93
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,390
Are you ok?

94
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,360
Wh-What do you mean?

95
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,770
You're looking pretty pale.

96
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,040
What? No way, man, I'm doin' super!

97
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,790
You aren't overworking yourself?

98
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,870
Well, I have been working extra over time.

99
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,880
Well sometimes doing the things you love can take their toll on you!

100
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,590
Well, I'm gonna be working all night again!

101
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,970
Kosuke. Your dinner tonight should give you lots of energy.

102
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,150
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,820
Huh? Looks like Minami-chan isn't here yet.

104
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,400
Shall we wait?

105
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,800
With this, it's warm.

106
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,200
You are so nice, Listy.

107
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,120
You think so?

108
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,710
I do. I think you're very kind.

109
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,370
I like that kind of person.

110
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,420
Ah, Chika-chan! What are you up to?

111
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,750
Oh, Yuuhi-chan!

112
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,110
We're waiting for Minami-chan to show up.

113
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,850
Oh really?

114
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,400
This is Listy. She is going to be staying with us for a while.

115
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,900
Nice to meet you, I'm Shina Yuuhi.

116
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,290
So cute!

117
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,000
How old are you? Are you from Japan?

118
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,140
Wow! Your hair is silver!

119
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,180
Ah, dang! That's some crazy static electricity! I'm sorry, are you ok?

120
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,090
Sorry Listy, we carry a lot of different stuff and that happens sometimes.

121
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,590
Ah! The bus is here. When you get back, let's sit down and chat for a bit.

122
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,520
See you later!

123
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,220
That spark just now...

124
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,070
It's great. I have a hard time even producing enough heat for my own body.

125
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:58,550
My special genetic code allows me to convert my body energy into an electrical charge.

126
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,830
I think a lot of your energy goes into your wings and regeneration.

127
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,278
Yes, that's true. If I get cut it heals very quickly,

128
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,877
but I tend to get colds very easily so it's not all great.

129
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,980
Yeah, it kinda sucks.

130
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,310
I always wanted to be able to live a normal life, so I tend to avoid using my powers.

131
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,140
It can be difficult living with these abilities.

132
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,160
You know what? Your friend sure is taking a long time, Chika.

133
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,060
Yeah, no kidding.

134
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,850
Minami-chan!

135
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,730
Lena-chan!

136
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,450
Too slow! If you don't get to the basket faster you'll get checked!

137
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,450
Yes, ma'am!

138
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,030
Oh, they're playing a game.

139
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,150
I wonder if Minami-chan is there...

140
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,530
Ah! There she is!

141
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,570
62 to 60. Varsity wins!

142
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,950
Weak... You are all too weak.

143
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,200
At this rate how can you expect us to feel secure about our backups?

144
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,710
You need to put more effort in!

145
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,030
That's all for today. Get this place cleaned up and hit the showers.

146
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,420
Yes ma'am

147
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,390
Okamoto.

148
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,550
Taki-san?

149
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,220
Don't worry, you guys are putting in a lot of effort. Just a bit more and you will be ready to go.

150
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,680
Taki-san.

151
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,490
Well, do your best!

152
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,030
Thanks for the tip!

153
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,310
I saw that.

154
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,560
She gave you a compliment. That's awesome...

155
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,470
Oh, it's not a big...

156
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,910
Lena-chan, that last pass was pretty sweet too.

157
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,330
Thank you!

158
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,820
Tomo-chan, your 3 pointer was amazing as well.

159
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,170
You think so?

160
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
Heck yeah! Next time we'll win for sure!

161
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,970
Yeah, let's do it!

162
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,720
I love this atmosphere... we can totally do this!

163
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,380
Everybody! Let's do our best to keep up this energy and do our best!

164
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,740
All right!

165
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,790
Minami-chan.

166
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,270
I had to show up.

167
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,790
Chika-chan! Oh crap! I was supposed to meet you a while ago!

168
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,730
No, it's ok... It looks like you had a game today.

169
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,880
I'm so sorry! I'll clean up, grab a shower and be with you in a minute.

170
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,890
It's really ok, you don't have to rush.

171
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,110
Seriously, just a minute, ok?

172
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,660
Wait for me ok?

173
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,470
New boarder?

174
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,670
Yep! This is Listy.

175
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,080
I'm Okamoto Minami. Nice to meet you.

176
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,080
Nice to meet you.

177
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,610
I'm honestly sorry about today though... I totally messed up your shopping.

178
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,390
Seriously, don't give it another thought. You had a game today so it's fine.

179
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,080
But we lost...

180
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,820
Maybe, but I could tell you were really giving it your all.

181
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,730
Yeah but if we don't prove ourselves to Rikako-san and the others...

182
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,646
We are replacing the Varsity team when they graduate,

183
00:10:56,647 --> 00:11:00,059
so we need to prove ourselves to them so they know the team is in good hands.

184
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,030
Well, it doesn't matter. I guess it's just a matter of pride for me.

185
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,810
I wouldn't say that.

186
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,770
Graduation... Huh...

187
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,400
We're back!

188
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,290
Welcome home!

189
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,610
Wow! That smells great! We're having white stew for dinner, right?

190
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,160
Correct!

191
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,430
Kosuke-san... Give me a little taste!

192
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,870
All right, let's do this!

193
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:34,600
Ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra! Do your best, Kaoru!

194
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,320
Hey, Mio-chan, we don't really need to make all this fuss. She isn't playing baseball in there!

195
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,250
That may be the case but normal cheering is so boring.

196
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,380
Well, I guess if you insist then we should do this right...

197
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,500
...Yuuhi-san?

198
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,310
Wow! It looks like you're having a good time.

199
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,390
What are you guys doing?

200
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,120
You guys want to help? Kaoru has a test coming up and...

201
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,120
If she fails the test Kaoru is gonna have to go back home!

202
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,000
It would suck hard if she had to leave, so we're trying to cheer her on!

203
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,310
Well that does sound fun...

204
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,340
Come on, Yuuhi-chan...

205
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,430
Mio-chan... Kaede-chan... Please don't disturb Kaoru-san's...

206
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,660
But this really helps!

207
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,460
Oh yeah! I bet she's in there feeling energized as we speak!

208
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,240
I understand, but Mayuki-san is trying to work as well...

209
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,990
Will you shut the hell up!?

210
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,220
How the hell do you expect me to get anything done with all this racket?!

211
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,060
Yeah, well, I'm not really concerned about you.

212
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,860
Oh! Now you've done it...

213
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,330
Come on now, Mayuki-san, let's just try and calm down...

214
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,440
Who the hell asked you?!

215
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,650
Please don't kill me!

216
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,700
Shut up!

217
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,630
Yeah, you should apologize, Kaoru!

218
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,470
Shut your face!

219
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,870
Um... Could you please keep it down?

220
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,160
Uh... Sure...

221
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,420
Come on in...

222
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,310
Check out how clean it is. Kosuke-onii-chan has been cleaning it every day.

223
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,430
If there is anything you need just let me know, ok?

224
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,650
Oh, what about your medicine?

225
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,300
Whoa there! That's a pretty cool trick.

226
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,694
Yeah well, there is more of them.

227
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:13,622
Compound-F, compound-S, tablets EV-1 through EV-3, MR capsules, ST-3.

228
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,140
Wow, that's way more than me.

229
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,050
And also these.

230
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,000
Those are AS tablets right?

231
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:18,850
Yeah.

232
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,960
You must hate all that.

233
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,840
I don't really have a choice. Out of all the medicines, this one is the most important.

234
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,520
Mayu! She already gave up... Shouldn't you let her go?

235
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,920
Shut up you... This is your fault after all...

236
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,190
Kosuke, Kosuke... You have to do something!

237
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,410
Mayuki-san, dinner is almost ready, so don't go anywhere.

238
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,460
You are no help at all, Kosuke!

239
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,810
Yeah. That tastes right.

240
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,110
Dang it, Kosuke... If my father was here he would definitely stop this!

241
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,850
Oh, is he coming back?

242
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,910
Oh! That's right, I didn't tell you. My father is coming back for Christmas, so we won't need you...

243
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,180
Alright,  what kinda food can you make out of a cat?

244
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,490
I'm not food!

245
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,760
Shut up, you!

246
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,810
Somebody save me!

247
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,800
Mio's father, Keigo-san, used to be the manager of the dorm, didn't he?

248
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,540
If I remember correctly, I heard he was oversees for work...

249
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,530
Hong Kong {Sign may need retimed}

250
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,970
Ok, 2 beers.

251
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,860
Thanks.

252
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,830
So, what can I get you today, Keigo-san?

253
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,050
I'll take the beef bowl, please!

254
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,170
How about you, Won-san?

255
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,240
I guess I'll get the same.

256
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,990
Got it! Two beef bowls. I'll get right on it.

257
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,250
...So? Did you get it?

258
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,350
Yeah... I found "The Silver Demon".

259
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,130
Here it is.

260
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,490
Apparently, they call her "The Silver Lady".

261
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,470
I guess she has recently been repatriated from New Delhi.

262
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,800
You gotta wonder why someone branded as...

263
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:10,525
a terrorist by the HGS would want to go back to Japan.

264
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,340
Something doesn't feel right... It's probably best we waited on the selection...

265
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,060
Sorry to keep you waiting... Two beef bowls.

266
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:18,990
Thanks.

267
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,110
No problem, enjoy!

268
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,280
I'll do that!

269
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,980
Hey, Kanna-san... How about shutting down from tomorrow?

270
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:30,640
The truth is that I'm going to have to head back to Japan over Christmas for some business...

271
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:36,050
What do you think of coming back? We should go back together.

272
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,315
Everyone, listen up! It looks like I'm going on vacation starting tomorrow,

273
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,863
so the next round is on the house!

274
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,350
Ok, everyone! Eat up!

275
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,070
Chika!

276
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,800
What are you doing up there?

277
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,150
Oh, nothing really.

278
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,640
That's both cold and dangerous... Come on down.

279
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,910
All right!

280
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,140
Jeez, don't scare me like that!

281
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,850
Sorry.

282
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,850
If you stay like that, you're gonna catch a cold.

283
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,070
Thank you, Onii-chan.

284
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,330
Here you go!

285
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,330
This smells good!

286
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,000
I know, right?

287
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,270
I wonder if Kaoru-san is gonna be all right.

288
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,690
Yeah, no kidding.

289
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:06,820
Kaoru really is putting in the effort, but her power is her concentration in battle, so it's no surprise.

290
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,580
But I think it's ok. She always pulls through in the end.

291
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,960
Ah, I see.

292
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,830
Yeah.

293
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,330
About Minami-chan.

294
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,390
I wonder what school she will go to after graduation?

295
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,270
I'm not sure. I think it would have to be somewhere with a great sports program.

296
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,000
I see.

297
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,830
However, until that time comes at least... She'll be here.

298
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,140
Because your cooking is so delicious, right?

299
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,840
Because all of the friends important to her are here.

300
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,610
Ok, well it's getting late, I'd better hit the hay.

301
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,580
Good work, onee-chan.

302
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,960
Oh no. But I've been fine lately.

303
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,955
The AS drug is important because it helps to curb...

304
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,718
one very potent side effect of my condition...

305
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,310
Oh no...

306
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,000
I... I can't...

307
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,010
I shouldn't do this...

308
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,610
Oh no...

309
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,000
No... No...

310
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,140
I don't want this...

311
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,160
No...

312
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,180
No...

313
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,050
No, don't!

314
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,260
No!

315
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,290
Hey, cut it out!

316
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,750
I give up!

317
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,120
Hold on, you!

318
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,210
What is it?

319
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,270
Is she watching us?

320
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,970
Don't stare.

321
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,450
You could get cursed if you look at her.

322
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,970
That girl is cursed.

323
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,030
Cursed?

324
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,250
Yeah, she's always been in that room.

325
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:55,011
They keep here there for the happiness of others.

326
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,490
Tora-chan, what is it? Dinner time?

327
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,980
Oh, Tora-chan...

328
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,290
This is the Sazanami Girls dorm, can I help you?

329
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,150
Oh Kanna-san. It's been a while.

330
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,100
Ah! Chika-chan! It has been a while. How is everyone?

331
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,030
Everyone is doing great.

332
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,630
Glad to hear it.

333
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,275
The truth is, it seems I'm going to be in Japan...

334
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:41,227
over Christmas, so I am going to be staying at the dorm.

335
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,160
Sounds like it'll be fun.

336
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,730
I have something really important to talk to Kosuke-chan about, so could you get him for me?

337
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,800
Oh crap! The car is here! Tell everyone I said hello, ok?

338
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,540
Wait! Hold on a...

339
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,370
Tora-chan...

340
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,380
I wonder what the important talk was about?

341
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:10,212
If Kanna-san comes back for Christmas, what's going to happen to Kosuke-onii-chan?

342
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,360
If Kanna-san comes back, does that mean that Kosuke-onii-chan will have to leave?

343
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,430
I don't want that...

344
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,300
I refuse... Anything but that...

345
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,420
Ever since I was a child, I hated winter.

346
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,610
I hated the cold winds and the falling snow.

347
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,700
I hate winter... Because you can never tell what it will do to you.

348
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,500
So, what's going on? Do we have confirmation on the target yet?

349
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,170
Yes. But we've failed to maintain a visual.

350
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,030
What? What the heck is that supposed to mean?

351
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,820
Now, now, we don't have to worry about that.

352
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,670
But, sir...!

353
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,520
The TE1 Angel-class organism is that kind of a target.

354
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,710
We have various ways of getting our hands on her...

355
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,330
Hey, it looks like it's your turn...

356
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,500
Silver Ray...
