1
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,611
How are you feeling?

2
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:36,493
I see, I see. You cute little bastard.

3
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,538
The seal will break soon.

4
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,332
But until then, you must behave.

5
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:58,273
Tower of Etruria
Vol. 1 - The Bewithcing Magician

6
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,097
You may take her as your wife.

7
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,688
Oh. He's not that bad.

8
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,816
And what's more...

9
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,278
he's a handsome man. Just my type.

10
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:59,201
Are you in pain, Eiloppa?

11
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,136
So this man's life ends here.

12
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,765
"The Princess will be captured.

13
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,434
But then a highly skilled swordsman will rescue her.

14
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,395
And then the two will be bound together."

15
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,607
Fine! I accept the challenge!

16
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,571
Imbecile!

17
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,199
You try to solve every problem
in life with "Magic! Magic!"

18
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,077
Do you really think magic is the answer to everything!

19
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,871
How dare you speak like that Father!

20
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,414
We've entered a brand new Age of Magic!

21
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,417
Silence, fool! Why must you always be this way?

22
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,543
And what about you, Father?

23
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,670
Why won't you ever listen to me?

24
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,673
Because! Your magic is pointless!

25
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,885
How dare you! Your way of thought is outdated, Father!

26
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,345
C-Cecilia, you...

27
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,222
Wait! Calm down!

28
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,807
Let's discuss this...

29
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,350
Why... you...

30
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,978
Idiot!

31
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,733
And with those final words, my daughter ran away.

32
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,195
I hope she's doing okay,

33
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:22,701
but rumor says that she's been
captured by a magician in Etruria.

34
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,536
That's where you come in.

35
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:29,499
Can you rescue my daughter, swordsman Albion?

36
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,211
I'm a nomad swordsman.

37
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,671
I'm aware of the financial crisis engulfing this kingdom,

38
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,882
but if I'm successful in rescuing your beloved Princess,

39
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,718
then you will give me a handsome reward.

40
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,469
Do you accept?

41
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:44,973
If my daughter agrees, you may take her as your wife.

42
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,477
Leave it to me, Father!

43
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,188
Now for a valuable piece of information.

44
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,523
When my daughter gets overly emotional.

45
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,692
a symbol like this appears on her.

46
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,735
He's gone.

47
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,905
Kids these days.

48
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,323
Are you sure about this, Sire?

49
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,785
Having faith in the promise of
a lone nomadic swordsman?

50
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,120
It makes no difference to me.

51
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,124
In fact he seems a good match
for my beast of a daughter.

52
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,043
Don't you agree?

53
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,337
Yes, Sire.

54
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,263
He put up a decent fight.

55
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,180
All that remains is...

56
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,268
Just sit tight Magician of Etruria!

57
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,227
And then...

58
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,857
Wait for me, my Princess!

59
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,318
I'm coming to rescue you!

60
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:43,156
And when I do, I'll have my own castle!

61
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,369
Take that!

62
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,456
I wonder what she's like? I hope she's pretty.

63
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,710
Princess, are you hurt?

64
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,549
Swordsman, my heart ached
with anticipation to see you.

65
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,094
I have defeated the evil magician.

66
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,096
Everything is all right now.

67
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,056
My! I'm so glad!

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,435
Princess! What are you...

69
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:17,190
Please look. My body is the only way I can thank you.

70
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:21,611
And besides, I've become so wet waiting for you.

71
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,530
Please, don't restrain yourself.

72
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,950
Give yourself to me.

73
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,701
Princess!

74
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,245
Ah! That hurts!

75
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,958
"Ah, thrust into me harder!" shell scream.

76
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,586
Are you an idiot?

77
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,304
Etruria! Stay put!

78
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:54,186
You are the first to reach the top of this tower.

79
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,187
For that I congratulate you.

80
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,607
Shut up! Where is the Princess?

81
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,817
You needn't fret so.

82
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,904
Fine. As a reward for making it to the top of the tower,

83
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,822
I'll let you be my slave.

84
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,615
Shut up!

85
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,910
That face...

86
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,371
and those breasts...

87
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,707
Etruria is female?

88
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,250
And young, at that!

89
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,251
You're missing the point!

90
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,420
That's not what's most surprising about me!

91
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,176
That symbol on your forehead...

92
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,887
Aside from that

93
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,389
— she's kind or pretty!

94
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,264
— Are you stupid!?
— she's kind of pretty!

95
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,226
Well me.

96
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,437
Either way, it's clear my Father sent you.

97
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,688
Therefore, you're my enemy.

98
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,691
Come forth, my Eiloppa!

99
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,279
Don't tell me... a monster?

100
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,156
I thought I killed them all.

101
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,535
This will seal your doom.

102
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,121
Get him, Eiloppa!

103
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,224
Playtime is over!

104
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,559
I must rescue the Princess.

105
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,650
This is Eiloppas true form.

106
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,901
Rather impressive, wouldn't you say

107
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,656
Come. Have your fun with him.

108
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,829
Come on! Hurry up and kill him!

109
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,707
W-Wait.. stop...

110
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,749
Not me!

111
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,087
Hey! Stop it!

112
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,174
That's not the kind of "fun" I meant!

113
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,925
No!

114
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,677
Um...

115
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,095
Stop it!

116
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,404
Stop. Stop it now!

117
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,658
Not bad.

118
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,369
Don't look at me! Please!

119
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,122
No, don't!
Well its kind of hard not to look.

120
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:24,377
Don't... go in there.

121
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,643
Hey! Stop messing around and
tell me where the Princess is!

122
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,562
If you do, I might help you out.

123
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,358
I am a... magician.

124
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:52,531
I'm the Magician of Etruria!

125
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,911
Uh, yeah, but where is Princess Cecilia?

126
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,753
Don't!

127
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,278
There's one hurdle cleared.

128
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,247
There, I rescued you.

129
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,915
So tell me where the Princess is.

130
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,919
F-Forget about that. Can you get rid of this sensation?

131
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,514
Oh, fine.

132
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,225
A lot came out

133
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,688
I didn't know humans were so warm.

134
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,405
About that swordsman...

135
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,449
it appears he has found the Princess.

136
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,911
You understand what this means, Palmira?

137
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,037
Yes, Lord.

138
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,588
Tower of Etruria.

139
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,894
Shit. It just never ends.

140
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,438
This is the third time this has happened.

141
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,566
Just how many soldiers can Etruria make?

142
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,110
For the last time, its not me.

143
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,113
And I keep telling you, call me "Cecilia"!

144
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,614
Listen, you...

145
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,162
That hurt, you asshole!

146
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,375
Shut up already!

147
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:08,560
Well, monsters like that are no
match for the likes of me.

148
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,563
Not so fast. I defeated half of them.

149
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,814
Yeah, fine.

150
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,607
Hey, are you listening to me?

151
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,610
They were just bone monsters after all.

152
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,071
We're just swamped with bad luck.

153
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,824
Really? I've been having pretty good luck, actually.

154
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,994
That reminds me, how much longer
are you going to follow me?

155
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,203
Forever.

156
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,371
What!?

157
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,789
I see no problem with that.

158
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,584
Just pretend I'm Princess Cecilia. I'm your prize!

159
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,585
That again?

160
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,130
A real princess is no comparison to the likes of you.

161
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,215
You really are dense.

162
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,383
What?

163
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,354
So...

164
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,983
Why am I sleeping in the barn?

165
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,610
There are creepy things in here.

166
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,740
I wonder if he and Eiloppa are getting along.

167
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,950
Oh, well. Time to sleep.

168
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,179
What's this? This tingling sensation in my body...

169
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,557
My hands are moving on their own.

170
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,937
Is your body in turmoil Princess Cecilia?

171
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,397
Wh-Who s there!?

172
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,902
There are those in this country who
seek to usurp the Kings throne.

173
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:45,073
I was sent here to assassinate you.

174
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,034
But I've taken pity on you.

175
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:54,082
You wish to have intercourse with
me so badly that it's killing you.

176
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,303
Preparations okay.

177
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,682
Are you trying to use me to take over the kingdom?

178
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,434
Sorry, but I'm not into that.

179
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,147
No!

180
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:24,737
I can show you pleasures far more
erotic than those of a clumsy man.

181
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,618
No!

182
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,081
Not there!

183
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,379
Don't! Not there.

184
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,553
Jeez. What are you doing?

185
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,473
You came to save me.

186
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,267
l-ldiot!

187
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,352
I only came here to complain to you!

188
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,856
What's this smell?

189
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,984
It feels like my body is...

190
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,281
You were trapped under that woman's spell.

191
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:14,537
Wh-What are you doing, Etruria?

192
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,626
St-Stop.

193
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,213
You needn't hold back.

194
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,257
I don't mind doing it with you.

195
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,470
You always call me plain "you". Use my name for once!

196
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,139
Albion.

197
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,691
So, call me Cecilia.

198
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,235
Cecilia...

199
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,244
Cecilia, I want you.

200
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,207
I want you too, Albion.

201
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,668
Come in.

202
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,629
Cecilia, I'm coming in.

203
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,552
Yes! More!

204
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,763
Thrust into me harder!

205
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,705
More! Deeper!

206
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,590
No! No more!

207
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,467
I... I'm going to...
I'm almost there too.

208
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,594
I... I'm going to...

209
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,275
Albion...

210
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,658
That sort of thing is meaningless alone.

211
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,871
Come here. I'll be your partner.

212
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,252
It's your fault that it won't go down at all.

213
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,336
Own up to it!

214
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,174
Don't worry. I'll be gentle.

215
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,345
Come. Take that thing out.

216
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,390
You're all wet.

217
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,769
Okay. I'm putting it in.

218
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,706
I'm about to...

219
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,043
I'm cumming.

220
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,338
Cum! With me! With me!

221
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,597
So warm...

222
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,976
What a relief.

223
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,687
You have some nerve,

224
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,690
doing it with another woman as I was
sleeping just a few feet away.

225
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,400
But that was just...

226
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,861
You little...

227
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:41,577
Like I said! It was because of her magic spell.

228
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,663
Hmph. Pervert

229
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,665
That makes two of us.

230
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,583
It does not make two of us!

231
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,294
I would never sleep with another man.

232
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,421
So you're jealous.

233
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,215
I'm not jealous!

234
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,134
Oh, I nailed it.

235
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,051
Never mind!

236
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,263
Hey, slow down, Etruria!

237
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,974
You're calling me by the wrong name again!

238
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,645
Sir Albion...

239
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,316
Tower of Etruria.

240
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,950
Albion, you did well in rescuing my daughter!

241
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,243
I will reward you.

242
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,705
As promised, you may have my daughter as your wife!

243
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,168
Are you dissatisfied?

244
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,838
No. I'm very grateful, my liege.

245
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,257
I love you.

246
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,885
We will have the ceremony tomorrow.

247
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,053
For today, rest well.
Palmira, you bitch. You're still lurking around.

248
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,471
Palmira, you bitch. You're still lurking around.

249
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,727
What are you doing, Palmira?

250
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,230
You failed, yet you dare return?

251
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,859
What's wrong, General?

252
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,944
Uh, nothing, Sire.

253
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,199
Well never mind. For today...

254
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,125
Good for you!

255
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,961
Now you'll finally be lord of a
castle, just like you wanted!

256
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,297
What's wrong?

257
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,052
All the people of this kingdom
think you're Princess Cecilia.

258
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,930
You must've cast a really powerful spell.

259
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,641
You've got to be the thickest person I've ever met.

260
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,311
<i>Still, that's partly why I fell for you.</i>

261
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,482
Never mind that, what about tonight?

262
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,400
There's something you want to do, right?

263
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,404
Beautiful!

264
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,120
Not here!

265
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,915
What is this place?

266
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,876
I had no idea there was a maze
like this below the castle.

267
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,420
Oh my, oh my.

268
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,631
What's a pretty girl like you doing
in a dark place like this?

269
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,344
Oh, yes, I have an idea.

270
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,514
Why don't you become dinner for my cute little pet?

271
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,099
Dinner?

272
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,352
What?

273
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,441
This is...

274
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:23,990
It's an ultra-powerful magical being that the
royal family kept sealed up until now.

275
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,908
Isn't it cute?

276
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,703
What are you planning to do with it?

277
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,706
Destroy the world.

278
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,251
Every living thing will die,

279
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,296
starting with everyone in this kingdom.

280
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,506
Why?

281
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,843
It is the bidding of my Master.

282
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,429
Your... master?

283
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,055
That's right.

284
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,308
I won't let you do that!

285
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,645
The seal has been broken!

286
00:21:54,646 --> 00:22:00,776
Come, release yourself from the prison that
held you here for the last 500 years!

287
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,202
That's right!

288
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:14,790
Destruction! Thrash around! And destroy them all!

289
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,058
Yes!

290
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,810
Right there!

291
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,743
Will you return the favor?

292
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,543
Does it taste good?

293
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,670
It's delicious.

294
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,401
You still have more in you.

295
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,779
I can't hold out any longer. Let me have it!

296
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,659
So hard!

297
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,501
More! More!

298
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,348
Deeper! Deeper! More!

299
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,228
This feels wonderful!

300
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,356
No! It's coming out!

301
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,109
Good! Keep going!

302
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,080
No! I can't...

303
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,042
No, I'm going to cum...

304
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,085
I'm cumming!

305
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,809
Albion... I love you.

306
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:43,314
I... I... think I love you too.

307
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,282
What?

308
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,743
Albion, are you okay?

309
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,454
Pervert!

310
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,747
Hey...

311
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,420
My castle!

312
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,880
I'm not sure what's happening,

313
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,715
but it came from under the castle!

314
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,468
It's an old monster that was sealed long ago.

315
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,429
And just what about that thing is sealed?

316
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,182
Someone must've released the seal!

317
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,227
There's no way we can kill that thing.

318
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,187
Yes. It's too big.

319
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,653
I think this is crazy, but I'd better try.

320
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,404
I'll help you.

321
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,822
Be my guest.

322
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,533
Just a minute.

323
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,911
Eiloppa says he'll help.

324
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:56,011
Eiloppa was created from that creatures life force.

325
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,473
That means the creature is like a father to him.

326
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,809
Oh, of course, I'm its mother.

327
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,193
My castles still gone.

328
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,490
Sorry about that my groom!

329
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,664
So I guess it's off on another nomadic journey.

330
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,958
My, my, that makes me happy!

331
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,168
I love traveling with you.

332
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,965
Me too! I am honored to travel with you, Sir Albion!

333
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,551
Why do you have to come along?

334
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,720
It's my burden of love.

335
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,680
What the hell?

336
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,850

337
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,186

338
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,647
Coming, darling!

339
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,109
Maybe I should come too?

340
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,695
You're the last person we'd want coming!

341
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,280
Oh, is that a new gag?

342
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,573
Tower of Etruria

00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,075
