1
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,250
No!

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,210
You called me.

3
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,130
I didn't!

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,220
You broke the seal!

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,260
No!

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,760
Pledge yourself to me.

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,230
No... No! NO!!!

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,230
Follow me and
I shall answer your hatred.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,570
Well?

10
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,000
No!

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,250
No!

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,920
Open yourself!
Become one with my mind!

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,500
Demon Beast Invasion
episode 4

14
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,120
The snowfall which began
last night lasted until noon...

15
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,540
...and weather will be unsettled
for the next few days.

16
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,090
Due to deep snowdrifts in the
Kansai region, travel is disrupted.

17
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,220
Hello, Asakura residence.

18
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,890
It's me.
How've you been?

19
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,300
Miyuki?

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,520
I know this is sudden, but wanna
come up here for your school break?

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,520
What? It is kinda sudden.

22
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,650
Wanna?

23
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,570
I've been so lonely here since
I came for shrine maiden training.

24
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,940
I have no friend here.

25
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,530
I really want to talk to you.

26
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,320
But I have plans...

27
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,620
You're dating the son of
the Ungyosai temple master?

28
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,210
Huh? How did you know?

29
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,920
I'm psychic, remember?

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,590
So bring your boyfriend
with you.

31
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,670
But...

32
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,640
He'll be coming
whether you invite him or not.

33
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,930
No way!

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,310
I said I was psychic.

35
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,600
You two are possessed by
an evil hatred.

36
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,610
Miyuki!

37
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,230
Understand?
You have to be cleansed of it.

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,950
I'm your cousin,
so I can't ignore this.

39
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,490
You have to be purified.
So I'm inviting you to Ohyama.

40
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,370
Yeah, but...

41
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,580
I promise I'll meet you
at the train station.

42
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,710
See you then.

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,250
Hello? Hello?
Miyuki? Hello?

44
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,400
Very good, Miyuki...
Lure them to Ohyarna...

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,670
Really? I didn't know
you had a cousin like that.

46
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,620
Yeah.

47
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,460
She's from a long
line of shrine maidens.

48
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,170
Her predictions have
always been dead on.

49
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,550
But I don't want to believe that
Demon Beast is still after us.

50
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,350
Yeah...
That worries me, too.

51
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,350
Maitreya'e returned
to normal.

52
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,940
I'll have to give a memorial
service for the temple supporters.

53
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,950
What the devil?!

54
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,840
What is this?
Is the Ungyosai temple cursed?

55
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,420
Muneto, I'm sorry!
Did I bite you?

56
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,840
I'm all right, Kayo.

57
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,840
Muneto...

58
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,510
MUNETO!

59
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,220
MUNETO!

60
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,430
Dad!

61
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,440
- We're cursed!
- Dad!

62
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,310
We're cursed!

63
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,020
Something has corrupted
Maitreya's power!

64
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,070
- I cannot exorcise it!
- What do you mean?

65
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,200
Muneto, you share the
1,100-year-old karmic debt...

66
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,120
...of the Ungyosai family
to the depths of your soul!

67
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,450
Get a hold of yourself!.

68
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,750
What's with all this
anachronistic talk?

69
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,540
Maitreya... Maitreya...

70
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Kayo!

71
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,130
Mother...

72
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,460
I wander, lost in
a world of torment!

73
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,640
Mother,
only you can save me!

74
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,100
Kayo!

75
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,890
Kayo!

76
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,060
KAYO!

77
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,480
Naumaku Samanda
Amidaunken Sowaka!

78
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,910
Naumaku Samanda
Amidaunken Sowaka!

79
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,240
Naumaku Samanda
Amidaunken Sowaka!

80
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,550
Kayo!

81
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,470
Muneto!

82
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,810
Muneto!
Go to Ohyama!

83
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,520
Maitreya will never forgive you
unless you end your evil karma!

84
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,810
To Ohyama...

85
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,080
Strange...
It's just like Miyuki said.

86
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,500
Yeah. So, we must purify
ourselves of the Demon Beast.

87
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,420
I can face anything
as long as I'm with you.

88
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,220
Ohyama, where I will train at,
allows no women...

89
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,840
...into the forbidden sealed area.

90
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,970
No! Then what will I do?!

91
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,180
Outside the sealed zone you'll
have to have Miyuki purify you.

92
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,270
Have Miyuki...?

93
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,570
A shrine maiden with
divine powers in her blood...

94
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,110
...will be able to protect you.

95
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,820
You'll be safe until I return.

96
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,240
I just feel...
Sorta nervous about it...

97
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,400
The evil moves to the west...

98
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,270
Kayo...

99
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,280
Muneto...

100
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,240
Overshoot your station?

101
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,990
No, sir.

102
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,800
Kayo!

103
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,470
Miyuki!

104
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,930
How are you?

105
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,260
Great, just great!

106
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,270
Oh? You seem different.
Sexier.

107
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,470
Really?

108
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,480
Anyway, this is really weird.
We came together...

109
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,310
...just like you predicted.

110
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,270
This is Muneto Ungyosai.

111
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,940
How do you do?

112
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,700
Well, hello there.
Hmm, not bad at all.

113
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,540
Strange... Have we
met somewhere before?

114
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,080
Whoa, time out! No pick-up lines
for my boyfriend, please!

115
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,380
Whatever you want.

116
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,720
Let's go.

117
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,350
Strange... I DO feel like
I know her from somewhere...

118
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,060
But where?

119
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,980
We'll take It easy tonight, then
go to Ohyama tomorrow morning.

120
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,440
Just like old times!

121
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,360
But I thought
women aren't allowed into Ohyama.

122
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,650
We'll just go
up to the gates.

123
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,070
There's a waterfall there for
women to purify themselves in.

124
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,410
Just leave it to me.

125
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Muneto, hurry up!

126
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,960
Can I beat my cursed destiny?

127
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,800
Kayo?

128
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,240
I'll wash your back, Muneto.

129
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,070
Where's Miyuki?

130
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,620
Getting her photo album to show
you. From when she was little

131
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,330
She's really going
out of her way for us.

132
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,170
Yeah, really.

133
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,760
Also...

134
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,130
I'll be sleeping in
Miyuki's room tonight, so...

135
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,010
So...

136
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,520
Kayo!

137
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,190
No, Muneto.
Not yet.

138
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,950
Ready, Kayo?

139
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,910
Yes!

140
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,140
Kayo!

141
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,800
Yes! Oh, yes!

142
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,480
Kayo, I'm going to...!

143
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,850
Kayo...

144
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,150
- Uh, it tickles.
- I love you, Kayo.

145
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,230
I love you, Muneto.

146
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,570
Ow! You little...!

147
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,250
No! Muneto, please!

148
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,460
Munechika... What do you
want at this hour?

149
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,550
I saw ominous clouds
to the west.

150
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,930
I've come to see if you were
all right, my brother.

151
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,980
Being excommunicated from the
Ungyosai shrine leaders for my heresy...

152
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,820
I had first thought
I shouldn't interfere. However...

153
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,900
The temple votive statue is cursed.

154
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,530
I'm sure you know this.

155
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,530
The Ungyosai family,
loyal servants of the Buddha...

156
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,910
...once committed
a grave sin against him.

157
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,830
It has afflicted many of us
in the past, not just you.

158
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,590
I never thought
it would affect Muneto.

159
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,130
As things stand,
we risk being cut off from...

160
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,760
...not only Maitreya's grace,
but from all the gods!

161
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,550
And where's Muneto?

162
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,220
I sent him to the main temple
to do his penance.

163
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,230
What?!
To Ohyama?

164
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,940
What are you so
upset about?

165
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,190
It could be a trap!

166
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,230
What are you saying?
The temple is holy ground.

167
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,490
You don't know the true nature
of the temple, my brother.

168
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,570
But...!

169
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,740
Ohyama is holy ground...

170
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,450
...but there are evils
which await rebirth there...

171
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,750
...and plot the overthrow
of the earth.

172
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,250
You can't mean...
The Demon Beast?!

173
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,210
I don't believe it.

174
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,960
Ohyama is insulated
from the demon realm.

175
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:48,340
Ohyama is a world unto itself,
insulated from the depths of man!

176
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,640
You were naive!

177
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,480
Brother!

178
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,700
Sohnen, my love.
It's been so long.

179
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,620
A thousand years
I've longed for you.

180
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,330
But at last I see you again.
I'm so happy.

181
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,000
Sohnen...

182
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Why? Why do
you flee from me?

183
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,350
Stay back!

184
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,350
No woman may enter
the holy grounds of Ohyama!

185
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,350
Now leave me in peace!

186
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,320
No! I will stay, though
it bring down the gods' wrath!

187
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,650
Until you and I are man and wife!

188
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,070
No!

189
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,370
A servant of the gods cannot
profane his body with lust!

190
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,750
You take joy in
scarring my skin?

191
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,420
Then please, end my life.

192
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,220
Kill me, and run.

193
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,720
Kill me, and I will only
keep on following you.

194
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,720
Come...

195
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,900
Forgive me...

196
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,570
Forgive me!

197
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,740
Hold me...
Hold me like this...

198
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:47,130
Miyuki and I have met,
in our past lives.

199
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,090
Kayo?

200
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,140
Kayo!

201
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,430
She's gone!

202
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,310
Kayo! Where are you?!
Kayo! Kayo!

203
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,110
Miyuki, wait!

204
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,660
This is strange.
Miyuki, what's wrong?

205
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,670
"NO WOMEN WITHIN THESE BOUNDS"

206
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,790
Why didn't we tell Muneto?

207
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,530
Stop it!

208
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Don't do that!

209
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,200
Sohnen's scent...

210
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,540
What are...? No!

211
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,550
He is mine.

212
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,510
A thousand years of
longing shall be relieved.

213
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,350
What?!

214
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,310
Miyuki, what are you...?!

215
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,100
I shall offer you
to the Demon Beast.

216
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,520
No! Why?! Why?!

217
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,780
Kayo... You will pervert Ohyama's
power to the demon realm.

218
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,160
When this holy site which
forbids women is subverted...

219
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,490
...the Demon Beast will be reborn!

220
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,790
No! No!

221
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,120
Miyuki, don't you know
how horrible that would be?

222
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,000
When the Demon Beast revives...

223
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,170
...my thousand years of
longing will be answered!

224
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,760
No!

225
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,470
Let me go!

226
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,940
Miyuki, you've done it!

227
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,780
The boundary between the mountain
and the shrine is breached!

228
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,980
Kayo!

229
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,270
Muneto... Help me!

230
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,910
I am reborn!

231
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,620
Kayo, your warmth
has broken the barrier.

232
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,870
No! Stop it!

233
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,710
It is time for my rebirth!

234
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,300
Ecstasy! Paradise!
I can't think anymore!

235
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,890
Brother!
What is this?

236
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,810
Is the karmic debt upon
Muneto or brother?

237
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,940
The depth of the debt...

238
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,270
The Demon Beast is using the
thousand year curse himself!.

239
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,990
Don't die, my brother.

240
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,370
I shall cleanse the thousand
year curse upon the Ungyosai!

241
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,450
Mahm! Begone
stubborn and evil foe!

242
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,000
Seven trials become
seven blessings!

243
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,250
Naumaku Samanda Basaradan
Senta Makarosha Dasabadaya.

244
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,630
Un Takara Gamman.

245
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,340
Nahm! Begone,
stubborn and evil foe!

246
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,630
Seven trials become
seven blessings!

247
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,340
Om A Miri Tatei
Zekara Un!

248
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,690
Let's go!

249
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,010
Heaven! Heaven!

250
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,010
Great Munetara, hurry!
I can't wait anymore!

251
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,600
Wait, wait!

252
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,890
Wait, wait!

253
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,520
How skilled you are,
Great Priest!

254
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,060
Ah, small difference between
heaven and hell.

255
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:02,030
This is the ultimate ecstasy
to be found in this existence!

256
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,280
You're one to talk!

257
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,740
Your lust has floated in the
mountains for a thousand years.

258
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,240
You're a good ally to the
demon beasts...

259
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,700
...priest who transcends
this dimension!

260
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,080
Ecstasy! Ecstasy!

261
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,050
More! More!

262
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,760
Great Priest!

263
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,090
Yes!

264
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,520
Mother...
Mother has still not come!

265
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,810
The power I need to break
free of the demon realm...

266
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,150
Mother,
only you can provide it.

267
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,120
Excuse me. Have you seen
two girls around here?

268
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,630
- Are you mad?
- Ohyama is forbidden to women.

269
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,750
- But...
- Thank you...

270
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,460
...and good night.

271
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,300
Space and time are
already crumbling in Ohyama.

272
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,470
Can't those two see that?

273
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,880
Uncle Munechika!

274
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,470
Muneto, where's Kayo?

275
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,800
She's...

276
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,140
You have to get her out
of the sealed zone!

277
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,100
She's the one subverting
Ohyama's holy power.

278
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,350
But Kayo's with Miyuki,
a girl I met in a former life.

279
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,810
I thought my brother
was the only one.

280
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,480
But the son also shares
a lust-filled past life.

281
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,530
Uncle! Tell me!
What's happened to my father?!

282
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,530
He has assumed the form
of a past life...

283
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:19,330
...and is helping the Demon Beast
to shatter the lust seal on Ohyama.

284
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,170
He's what?!

285
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,500
It is karma.

286
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,510
You, his son, don't know
the depths of his past sins.

287
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,840
Even he doesn't know!

288
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,840
No...

289
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,850
Without realizing he's become
the Demon Beast's servant...

290
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,770
...he is soiling Ohyama...

291
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,520
...with the power of his lust
for thousand-year-old spirits.

292
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,190
It can't be!

293
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,860
Take this. You must
still his breath with it!

294
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,740
But I...
I can't do that!

295
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,160
He will rape Kayo as well!

296
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,450
This hellish power is fed by
the alien Demon Beast...

297
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,750
...and the desires of
a holy girl...

298
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,870
...and will allow hirn to
breach the seal on this place!

299
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,580
No...

300
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,250
Stop it...

301
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,890
Liar! You want me
to give you more!

302
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:21,600
Mother, help rne! Why do
you hide your true feelings?

303
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,940
I don't know...

304
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,950
The consciousness of the human
and Demon Beast realms...

305
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,290
...are mixing within your body!

306
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,960
Priest! They're open to you!
Both dripping holes!

307
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,960
Ah, it's like a
wriggling worm.

308
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:55,300
Mr. Ungyosai! Stop it!
No, please!

309
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,970
Muneto...

310
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,310
Mr. Ungyosai...!

311
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,660
I can't take it!

312
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Stop it!

313
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,630
Which do you want?
It's your choice.

314
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,000
Uncle...

315
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,670
Your father or your lover?
Now choose!

316
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,980
Kayo! You belong to
the Demon Beast!

317
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,990
Open your unwilling thighs!

318
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,490
Miyuki... Stop this...
This can't be happening...

319
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,330
It is!
You were born to steal Muneto's...

320
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,370
To steal Sohnen's heart!

321
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,340
Kayo!

322
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,550
Muneto!

323
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,630
Sohnen!

324
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,970
Kayo!

325
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,010
Miyuki, stop this.
I don't want to kill you.

326
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,020
Sohnen, my love.
I'll make you remember.

327
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,560
The warmth this part of
my body felt for you!

328
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,690
Stop it!
I'm not Sohnen!

329
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,740
He's been dead a thousand years
and reborn as Muneto Ungyosai!

330
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,410
Come, Sohnen!

331
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,410
Miyuki, what's...?

332
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,460
I've pursued you across a
millennium. I won't lose you now!

333
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,720
So warm, is it not?
Come into me!

334
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,840
Hold me. Embrace me.

335
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,050
Muneto!

336
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,760
No! If you
don't stop, I'll...!

337
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,100
Lick me!
To my very depths...

338
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,690
Stop it!

339
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,070
Miyuki!

340
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,070
Kayo...

341
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,120
Muneto!

342
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,080
Get out of the sealed zone!

343
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,040
As long as you're in here and
Ohyama's holiness is subverted...

344
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,830
...we won't be able to win!

345
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,380
The time of
conquest has come!

346
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,840
The time of my vengeance
I shall walk the earth again!

347
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,700
Sohnen, my love!

348
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,160
She's found us!

349
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,510
Kayo, hang in there!

350
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,850
Sohnen, wait for me!

351
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,520
Muneto!

352
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,570
Miyuki...

353
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,700
Sohnen, my love.
I'll never let you go.

354
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,580
Muneto!

355
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,750
Don't look!

356
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,380
Don't think of him as Muneto.
He has become Sohnen Ungyosai...

357
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,670
...holder of a
thousand years of karmic debt.

358
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,720
But...

359
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,850
If he doesn't settle the debt here,
you two will never be one!

360
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,220
Mister...

361
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,100
Miyuki, turn back
to normal!

362
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,400
You're being driven by
the thousand years of lust...

363
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,480
...the Demon Beast has unlocked.

364
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:26,740
Sohnen, what are you saying?
Do you reject me still?

365
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,910
I have only one wish.

366
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,910
To be with you, just once.

367
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,210
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

368
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,250
Forgive me... Yukino!

369
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,630
Sohnen!

370
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,930
Sohnen, my love!

371
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,930
Yukino!

372
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,930
Sohnen!

373
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,640
Ready?

374
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,280
Sohnen!

375
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,670
Sohnen!

376
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,860
Sohnen!

377
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,700
Sohnen, my love...

378
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:40,040
My regrets have left me...
Oh, joyous day!

379
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,400
Damn that thing!
It's broken the seal!

380
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,110
Damn it all...!

381
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,490
Dad!

382
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,700
Miyuki, I've done it!

383
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:24,420
Now kill the boy
before we descend the mountain!

384
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,040
Then come to me!

385
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,420
No!

386
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
Miyuki...

387
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,760
No! No! I won't!
I can't do it!

388
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,850
I've found you, Mother!

389
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,770
No!

390
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,940
And your drips of
your warm wetness!

391
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,730
By all means, come to me!

392
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,110
Miyuki!

393
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,410
Miyuki!
What are you doing?!

394
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,700
Run!
Kayo, save yourself!.

395
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,910
Traitor!
You dare turn against me?!

396
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,460
Miyuki!

397
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,420
Muneto, your father!

398
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,130
Right...

399
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,140
Father!
You've fallen into hell!

400
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,810
Father...

401
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,490
Damn you!

402
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,620
Muneto, run for it!
I'll handle this!

403
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,790
There's a marker at the summit
for the mountain's guardian deity.

404
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,460
The sealed zone ends there!
You can protect Kayo!

405
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,470
Right!
But, uncle...

406
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,010
I'll be fine!

407
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,470
- Kayo, let's go!
- Right!

408
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,180
Mother,
you won't escape me!

409
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,770
Wait!

410
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,150
Impressive! You're more than
you appear to be, monk!

411
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,610
Interplanetary Mutual
Observation Agent: Panther!

412
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,330
You face ME now!

413
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,790
Let's do it!

414
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,220
I wonder if my uncle's okay.

415
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,220
And what about Miyuki?

416
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,610
You won't escape me, Mother!

417
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,240
MOTHER!

418
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,580
- Muneto!
- Kayo!

419
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,920
Let me go!
Unhand me, traitor?

420
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,920
Miyuki! No...

421
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,420
Yukino.

422
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,300
Miyuki...

423
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,140
Sohnen, my love...
No, Muneto I mean.

424
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,890
Thank you for answering
my desires.

425
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,400
You have made me so happy.

426
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,560
Yukino...

427
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,230
I will let you go.
However...

428
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,240
When we are reborn...

429
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,870
...we will be
together once more.

430
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,280
Farewell.

431
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
What do you
think you're doing?!

432
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,350
Uncle!

433
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
What am I doing here...?

434
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,840
Kayo... Kayo!

435
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,970
Muneto!

436
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,260
Kayo...
I guess we made it.

437
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,640
Yeah.

438
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,890
As hot for each other as usual,
huh?

439
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:52,560
Miyuki?

440
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,770
Miyuki!

441
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,860
Miyuki, are you hurt?

442
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,320
Not a bit!
In fact, I feel great!

443
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,030
Thank goodness!
