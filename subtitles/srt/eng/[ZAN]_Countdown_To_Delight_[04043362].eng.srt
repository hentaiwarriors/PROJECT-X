1
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:13,059
This is a regular residential
neighborhood, it's nothing special.

2
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:26,797
And this is just a regular house.

3
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:33,812
My name is Motoki
and I live in this house.

4
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:36,316
But the people
around me are not normal.

5
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:41,919
Megumi...

6
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:47,657
They're doing it again?

7
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,396
More!

8
00:01:33,142 --> 00:01:35,303
Please, don't stop!

9
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:37,534
Megumi, you're cute...

10
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:49,755
Everyday, they're like that.

11
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,755
Help me, I can't take it anymore!

12
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:54,853
You envy me?

13
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:59,898
Once you see what my life is really
like, you won't think like that any more.

14
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:01,863
How frustrating!

15
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:10,104
Oh?

16
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:12,070
They became quiet suddenly.

17
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:13,341
Did they finish?

18
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:19,887
I can finally finish my homework.

19
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:22,115
They're really annoying.

20
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:29,053
E-Eika!

21
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:33,125
Hi.

22
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:34,260
How are you doing?

23
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:36,938
Her name is Eika.

24
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:41,799
She is my sister's girlfriend and the
main culprit in messing up my daily life.

25
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:44,310
By the way...

26
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,540
Who did you say was annoying?

27
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:48,048
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

28
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:49,844
Where's my sister Megumi?

29
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:51,508
Oh, my lover?

30
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,951
She's dreaming.

31
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,528
Go back to her room.

32
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:02,291
She'll be mad at me.

33
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:03,294
It's okay.

34
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:05,333
Jealousy is the spice of love...

35
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:06,897
Right?

36
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,333
I don't wanna be the spice!

37
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:15,166
By the way, your lover...

38
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:17,338
Don't change the subject!

39
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,078
What's his name?

40
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:22,673
Oh, it's Yuji!

41
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,048
He is not my lover.

42
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:28,246
He just says he is.

43
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,151
This is Yuji.

44
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:35,229
I think he's my best
friend but he doesn't think so.

45
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,766
Motoki is mine!

46
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:47,135
You should care about your
lover the way I care for Megumi.

47
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,839
I'm not gay.

48
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:52,574
Oh, really?

49
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:53,545
Yes!

50
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:55,674
Don't misunderstand...

51
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:58,349
Motoki, I understand!

52
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:01,149
You can't be satisfied with only a man?

53
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:05,122
Were you listening to me?

54
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:07,395
Well, then...

55
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,444
N-No...

56
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:28,512
Cute butt...

57
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:31,885
Stop it.

58
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:45,859
Hey, you got quiet all of a sudden.

59
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:11,157
You want to come, right?

60
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:12,989
But not yet!

61
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:15,190
What's that?

62
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:16,525
What are you going to do?

63
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:23,666
Ouch!

64
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:24,568
No!

65
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:26,171
Switch on!

66
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:39,079
Now you've got me all horny.

67
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:58,431
How's my technique?

68
00:05:58,707 --> 00:06:00,937
You just wanted to get laid!

69
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,842
That's not it.

70
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:04,742
I'm here to teach you!

71
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:21,024
Oh no, I can't hold back...

72
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:23,322
Coming!

73
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:30,463
So much...

74
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:42,881
Motoki!

75
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:44,418
Did you want to see me?

76
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:47,388
Y-Yuji?

77
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:58,495
Oh, leftovers!

78
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:02,997
What did you do to my Motoki?

79
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:09,971
W-Why Yuji...

80
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:14,980
Motoki!

81
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:17,309
I called him.

82
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:20,013
Jealousy is the spice of love, right?

83
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:23,450
Wake up, you were slightly injured.

84
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:27,490
Leftovers...

85
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,863
What're you looking at?

86
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:32,729
You're very noisy.

87
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:34,859
I was having such a good nap.

88
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,028
Hello.

89
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:38,401
Yuji, you're here too?

90
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:40,908
Emi...

91
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,574
Megumi is my sister.

92
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:47,308
She is rude and not feminine at all.

93
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:49,072
Well, excuse me.

94
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:51,108
The other one is Emi.

95
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:53,720
She is Megumi's friend and Yuji's sister.

96
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:58,050
She looks quiet but
she's actually crazy.

97
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:00,860
It is my pleasure to accept.

98
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:04,892
Emi, why're you here?

99
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,599
Eika asked me for a threesome.

100
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,536
But it looks like a fivesome.

101
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:26,015
I won't give Motoki to anybody!

102
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:35,155
Hey, Yuji.

103
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,920
You shut up!

104
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:42,028
I...

105
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:43,466
I hate...

106
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,170
...my life!

107
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:50,143
Where are you going, Motoki?

108
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:51,679
Play with us some more!

109
00:08:55,183 --> 00:08:57,708
Eika, let him be.

110
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:59,719
He is always like that.

111
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,745
Motoki, come back!

112
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:10,128
Well, okay.

113
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:18,897
Oh well...

114
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:21,238
It's hell on earth.

115
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:24,776
I want to escape from all
this and have a normal life.

116
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:28,671
But I guess I can't...

117
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,586
Nothing's going right.

118
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:41,627
We're sorry.

119
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:42,993
Are you all right?

120
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:46,261
Y-Yes.

121
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:47,767
I'm all right...

122
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:09,551
It's finally over!

123
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:14,155
Eika, don't you wanna go
shopping with me today?

124
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:15,988
Okay, but where?

125
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:21,568
Our favorite store is having a sale.

126
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:27,332
The big vibrator "Brad Pitt" is 40% off?

127
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:28,668
Megumi!

128
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:29,573
We should go.

129
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:35,182
What's wrong?

130
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,685
Are you worried about something?

131
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,045
Uh, yeah...

132
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:41,414
Actually about Motoki...

133
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:42,614
Motoki?

134
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:47,088
I haven't seen him
in your house recently.

135
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,523
He comes back late
and seems strange.

136
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:53,825
Seems...

137
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:54,799
Strange?

138
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:02,768
See?

139
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:03,708
Strange.

140
00:11:03,845 --> 00:11:06,541
He looks a little absent-minded.

141
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:08,481
Let's follow him.

142
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:15,286
It's Motoki.

143
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:16,449
Just moment.

144
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:25,590
W-What?

145
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,998
What is this?

146
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,660
I've heard about it.

147
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,830
It's Satonaka's house,
she moved here recently.

148
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,873
Her family is the richest in town.

149
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:34,600
But...

150
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:36,870
Why does Motoki come here?

151
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:54,488
I baked a cake.

152
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:57,759
Thank you, Natsuki.

153
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,367
Delicious.

154
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:05,129
I'm glad you like it!

155
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:08,640
You live in such a great house.

156
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,768
Quiet and calm...

157
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:14,274
After you eat, we should start.

158
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:15,040
Okay!

159
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:20,815
For this question, the answer is this...

160
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:22,186
Very good!

161
00:12:22,257 --> 00:12:23,281
I see.

162
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:26,418
Natsuki, you teach very well.

163
00:12:26,928 --> 00:12:27,952
Thank you.

164
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,094
But I feel bad.

165
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,964
I'm using you as a tutor for free.

166
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:35,893
Don't worry.

167
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:39,131
My car almost hit you.

168
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:40,572
I have to help you out.

169
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:42,640
No, you don't have to.

170
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:47,213
I'm very happy that I
can come here everyday.

171
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:48,540
Really?

172
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,744
This house is like an oasis for me.

173
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:55,545
I hadn't had such a quiet time.

174
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:57,358
And...

175
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:58,681
And?

176
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,052
Natsuki...

177
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:04,923
You're like my dream sister...

178
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,135
I'm happy too, because
I got a younger brother.

179
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:09,636
Please come here everyday.

180
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:11,069
Yes!

181
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:26,747
"Please come here everyday."

182
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:30,621
Oh Eika, I didn't
know you could read lips!

183
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:32,989
I have many talents...

184
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:34,423
What's this?

185
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:40,568
"Compared to you my real
sister is violent and rude."

186
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:43,193
W-What the hell!

187
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:53,510
I'll beat it out of him
when he comes back home.

188
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:56,750
We know the reason, anyway.

189
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:59,179
She looks like no fun.

190
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,949
He could have fun
if he hung out with us.

191
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:05,481
But that house is an oasis for Motoki.

192
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:08,084
He wants it.

193
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,493
I don't understand.

194
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,633
Natsuki...

195
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:23,333
Motoki!

196
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:24,639
Yuji.

197
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:26,738
Who's photo is that?

198
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:28,306
Who?

199
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:30,381
My new tutor.

200
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:32,352
Tutor?

201
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:35,286
T-Tutor?

202
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:37,552
Those two...

203
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,555
Too sweet...

204
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:39,556
Too much!

205
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:44,990
No, Motoki.

206
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,431
You can't go.

207
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:48,761
D-Don't get the wrong idea!

208
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:50,269
It's not like that.

209
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:53,068
But Motoki, you like her, right?

210
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:54,137
What?

211
00:14:54,242 --> 00:14:56,039
You were looking at her photo.

212
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:58,771
I-I just like her, so?

213
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,313
Yes, that's it.

214
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:03,908
That's your opportunity
for a first experience!

215
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:06,085
She is my oasis!

216
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:07,778
That's enough for me.

217
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:09,785
Then, you're not in love?

218
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,050
Stop it!

219
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:12,591
Answer me!

220
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:13,891
Shut up!

221
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:15,429
Just answer me!

222
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,725
Yes, I love Natsuki so much...

223
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,164
I knew it.

224
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:23,504
Motoki...

225
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:27,506
Natsuki.

226
00:15:28,142 --> 00:15:31,578
I brought your text book,
you forgot it yesterday.

227
00:15:34,148 --> 00:15:36,275
Um, did you hear that?

228
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:37,577
Yes...

229
00:15:37,652 --> 00:15:38,676
I...

230
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,184
It's okay.

231
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:41,745
I'm happy.

232
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,518
What?

233
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,031
Thank you.

234
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,226
I did it!

235
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:55,098
Thank you, everyone!

236
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:57,864
We'll be happy together.

237
00:15:58,339 --> 00:15:59,067
Motoki!

238
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,801
Natsuki!

239
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:04,708
I would like...

240
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:08,611
...to confess my feelings.

241
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,110
But I am embarrassed...

242
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:14,549
I'll be waiting for you at my
house, so come over today.

243
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:17,853
I was happy just with the quiet life.

244
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:21,223
But now, she likes me, too...

245
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:24,993
I'm the happiest man on Earth!

246
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:35,566
Mr. Motoki.

247
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:36,940
Please follow me.

248
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,649
What is this place?

249
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,186
Have fun.

250
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:48,187
W-Where is Natsuki?

251
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:52,686
W-What're those?

252
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:56,429
I was waiting for you...

253
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:57,787
Motoki...

254
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:04,433
N-Natsuki?

255
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,741
This is the real me.

256
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:15,678
Please accept my feelings!

257
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,157
I'm bored.

258
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:31,493
With Motoki around,
it's a lot easier to kill time.

259
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,225
Do you feel lonely?

260
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,363
Not like that, though.

261
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:42,170
Hey.

262
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:44,536
What's up?

263
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:46,478
Look at this.

264
00:17:52,353 --> 00:17:54,787
Weekly S&M Sunday.

265
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:57,251
Sounds like your type of magazine.

266
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:59,121
That's not the point.

267
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:00,089
Look at this!

268
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:09,158
Subscriber photos?

269
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:11,264
That's her!

270
00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:24,546
The girl Motoki likes!

271
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,951
This is what she really is like!

272
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:29,818
Princess Dominatrix, right?

273
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:34,452
So, by now, Motoki could be...

274
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,263
I've been dreaming
of this since I met you.

275
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:51,268
L-Leave me alone.

276
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:57,117
But I was worried
that you didn't like me.

277
00:18:58,052 --> 00:19:00,020
So I couldn't tell you...

278
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:03,151
But you like me...

279
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:07,159
I can love you all I want!

280
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:11,558
Don't you want to
have a simple relationship?

281
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:13,432
Why would I?

282
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:16,036
This is my way of love.

283
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:26,939
As I expected, you
know how to scream.

284
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:30,074
It's not a talent I want to practice.

285
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:31,477
Shut up!

286
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:35,587
Be glad.

287
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:36,552
Is it good?

288
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:37,952
Is it good?

289
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:40,091
Answer me, now!

290
00:19:43,698 --> 00:19:44,926
I'm so excited!

291
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:07,354
Look at that...

292
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,291
N-No.

293
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:17,523
What are you talking about?

294
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,829
I know how happy you are...

295
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:22,691
N-No.

296
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:26,596
I know you like it.

297
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:29,672
P-Please don't...

298
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,501
I-I'm...

299
00:20:38,352 --> 00:20:39,910
You look miserable!

300
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:46,450
But you're wonderful...

301
00:20:55,836 --> 00:20:58,304
Isn't that strange?

302
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:01,398
Look at me.

303
00:21:11,552 --> 00:21:13,042
N-Natsuki...

304
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:16,154
I'll punish you.

305
00:21:35,676 --> 00:21:38,144
You're moving too fast...

306
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:39,443
No.

307
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,638
Not yet.

308
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:45,851
But I...

309
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:49,051
If you come before me...

310
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,385
...l'll punish you more.

311
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:56,453
I can't stand.

312
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:05,967
W-What's happening?

313
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:10,843
Earth people call to heaven for our aid.

314
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,513
We come to defeat all evil.

315
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:16,943
Beauty squadron!

316
00:22:24,392 --> 00:22:26,519
Ecsta Ranger.

317
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:30,361
W-W-Why did you break into my house?

318
00:22:30,998 --> 00:22:34,195
We just wanted to
try a flashy entrance.

319
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:47,905
Are you okay, Motoki?

320
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,613
Emi.

321
00:22:53,554 --> 00:22:56,045
Is that Eika?

322
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,723
Don't try to steal my Eika!

323
00:23:03,364 --> 00:23:05,298
Sorry, it's a habit.

324
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:09,265
Megumi, too?

325
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:13,437
Did you guys come to save me?

326
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:15,165
Well...

327
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:18,573
We just don't like it
when others use our toy.

328
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:25,149
You bitches!

329
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:27,551
I won't give Motoki to you.

330
00:23:28,622 --> 00:23:29,486
What?

331
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,289
You want to fight?

332
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:35,929
We'll fight to the climax!

333
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:44,963
Destroy!

334
00:23:54,882 --> 00:23:55,780
Excuse me?

335
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:57,875
What?

336
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:02,545
Why am I caught?

337
00:24:02,623 --> 00:24:05,353
What happened to our action scene?

338
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:11,460
No one wants to see that kind
of action in an erotic comedy.

339
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:14,300
That's not right!

340
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:19,205
We have to respond
to what the client needs.

341
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:20,972
N-Needs?

342
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:23,340
That means...

343
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:29,944
Oh, it sounds like you like it...

344
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:34,981
I-I'm not used to being a masochist.

345
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:36,283
Really?

346
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:38,188
Then, you may love it...

347
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:50,735
Hey, I found this over there.

348
00:24:51,305 --> 00:24:52,932
Oh, great!

349
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:54,834
Let me...

350
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:01,748
All right.

351
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:09,119
Vengeance for Motoki!

352
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:20,332
Come on, come on, come on!

353
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:21,731
Come on, come on!

354
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:23,794
Come on!

355
00:25:31,212 --> 00:25:33,680
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

356
00:25:39,486 --> 00:25:43,718
Promise us you won't
molest Motoki without telling us.

357
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:46,349
Then we'll let you come.

358
00:25:50,264 --> 00:25:52,164
You don't want to, huh?

359
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:58,501
All right, I promise.

360
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:00,801
Good girl.

361
00:26:37,544 --> 00:26:39,409
I'm coming too...

362
00:27:02,903 --> 00:27:04,336
Motoki!

363
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:06,528
Y-Yuji?

364
00:27:06,974 --> 00:27:10,205
I've heard you quit seeing your tutor.

365
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:14,173
Yes...

366
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,242
Motoki.

367
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:23,713
I thought I found my oasis, but
Natsuki wasn't the girl I wanted...

368
00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:26,591
I can never live in peace!

369
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:31,060
Don't be so upset.

370
00:27:31,131 --> 00:27:32,996
Someday you'll find peace.

371
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:36,127
Thank you.

372
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:39,996
And if you want to...

373
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:43,373
I can help you find it!

374
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:46,608
What?

375
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:49,573
Kissy kissy!

376
00:27:51,652 --> 00:27:52,346
You fool!

377
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,044
Motoki.

378
00:27:56,857 --> 00:27:59,087
Play with us!

379
00:27:59,393 --> 00:28:03,090
They said I can play
with you when they do!

380
00:28:04,698 --> 00:28:06,063
I can't take it!

381
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:09,564
Wait, Motoki.

382
00:28:09,703 --> 00:28:11,796
Hey, hey Motoki!

383
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:13,601
Eika is my girlfriend!

384
00:28:14,274 --> 00:28:16,003
I'm outta here!

385
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,505
Help me!
