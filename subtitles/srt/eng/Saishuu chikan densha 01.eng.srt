1
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:34,092
That's enough.

2
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:37,530
Leave me alone.

3
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,494
This woman is about to lose herself.

4
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:44,002
And when she does, what
are you going to do?

5
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:50,441
You're going to turn that woman
into an insatiable sex monster.

6
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,137
That's none of your business.

7
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:55,147
You don't understand the consequences.

8
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:58,210
You are a beast, you make them
fall and then toss them aside.

9
00:00:58,284 --> 00:01:00,218
She's enjoying herself just fine.

10
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:00,911
So...

11
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:02,111
So?

12
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,992
So you keep making
women lose themselves.

13
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:12,831
You don't know what it
means to love or be loved.

14
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,292
You just keep destroying these women.

15
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:17,593
Where will that lead you?

16
00:01:26,913 --> 00:01:28,778
If that is what you want...

17
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:53,237
Midnight Sleazy Train

18
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,171
What are you doing?

19
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:37,371
Stop it!

20
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:39,684
Oh, come on!

21
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:41,180
Stop it!

22
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:42,613
Stop it!

23
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:46,247
Someone help me!

24
00:02:46,326 --> 00:02:47,987
Shut up, stay still!

25
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,653
I'll make you feel good!

26
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,264
Stop!

27
00:02:58,338 --> 00:02:59,134
No!

28
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:00,797
It hurts!

29
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:04,700
I said shut up!

30
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:05,641
Shut up!

31
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:06,404
Help me!

32
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:16,119
She's crying for help!

33
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,779
How can he force
himself on her like that?

34
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,217
This is great!

35
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:23,657
Don't turn your face away.

36
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:26,397
Next stop, Kitasato, Kitasato.

37
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:31,229
Please take your belongings
with you when leaving the train.

38
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,303
He's not very good.

39
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:41,113
There's a good reason why I say that.

40
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:46,017
It was before I started
working for the Kankyu Railroad...

41
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,738
You want it, don't you?

42
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,245
No, from behind.

43
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:57,721
It's never felt this good before.

44
00:04:58,224 --> 00:05:00,124
It feels so good.

45
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:09,565
My whole body is on fire!

46
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:12,228
I think I'm going to lose my mind!

47
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,171
Keep your voice down.

48
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:16,765
Do you want everyone to hear you?

49
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:18,143
But, but I...

50
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:19,769
Silly girl.

51
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,510
More, more, more!

52
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:34,459
The doors are thin.

53
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:37,695
We don't want anyone to
come, so I'm going to come.

54
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:44,195
I always make them come.

55
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:51,600
So they've never screamed for
help, and I've never been caught.

56
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:58,248
So in my eyes, perverts who force
themselves on girls are lowlifes.

57
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:00,853
What are you going to do, Tetsuo?

58
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,319
What do you mean?

59
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,252
There are rumors that the Momogawa
line is going to be shut down.

60
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:10,522
That means we're going to be laid off.

61
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:12,362
Isn't that right?

62
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,857
I see.

63
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,092
Victims of the economic downturn...

64
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:18,997
By the way, I hear
they hired a consultant.

65
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,834
It was in the monthly report.

66
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:25,075
A princess type named Reiko Hayama.

67
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:30,647
Acting like this doesn't concern you
is not going to benefit you.

68
00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:35,319
Three generations of this railroad
family is coming to an end with you.

69
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:39,755
In this bad economy, it's
going to be hard to find work.

70
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:43,692
See, I don't care if I stay
in the railroad business.

71
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:46,493
I can go into my family business.

72
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,562
That's not all.

73
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:52,902
If the railroad goes out of business,
what's going to happen to Momokawa Township...

74
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:54,564
...it's already in bad shape.

75
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:56,069
What do you mean?

76
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:00,641
It means that our home town
might not exist anymore.

77
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:03,714
It's exactly as you say.

78
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:05,347
Hello.

79
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:07,642
Hi Sana, on your way home from school?

80
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,345
Yes.

81
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:11,885
I overheard you talking...

82
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:12,980
Hey!

83
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:18,830
As a young person with her whole
life ahead of her, what do you think?

84
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:20,759
I completely agree with you.

85
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,631
My friends and I really like
the idea of life in the big city.

86
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:27,934
There are really no
jobs for me in this town.

87
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,168
We can still get around by train, but
if the railroad goes out of business...

88
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:36,076
...I think everyone will move to the city.

89
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:41,719
Railroads and roads are necessary
for a town's development.

90
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:45,086
Sana, your dad is still
digging for hot springs, right?

91
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:48,092
Yeah, but I don't think
it's going to work.

92
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:52,591
If we could find a hot spring it
would be the boost this town needs.

93
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:54,459
Come on, stop dreaming.

94
00:07:54,634 --> 00:08:00,834
Don't you have any better ideas of how
to keep the railroad from going under?

95
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:02,062
I know!

96
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:04,303
I'm thinking, give me time!

97
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:05,874
Don't strain yourself.

98
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:09,106
The only thing your family is
good at is making trains run.

99
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:11,149
None of you are great thinkers.

100
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,945
Hey Makoto, that's not nice!

101
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:15,315
You owe him an apology.

102
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:17,484
There's not need for that, is there?

103
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,816
Ever since we were
kids, we knew our roles.

104
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:24,363
I think, and you make things happen.

105
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:25,359
Right?

106
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:27,560
That's right.

107
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,268
Makoto, you're so mean.

108
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:31,768
Tetsuo, let's go home.

109
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:33,028
Come on!

110
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:36,630
I'm sorry, I still have work to do.

111
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:38,335
I see.

112
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:41,376
So some other time then.

113
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,072
Good luck, Tetsuo.

114
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:44,306
Yeah.

115
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:47,810
You're like her big brother.

116
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:51,587
She doesn't see you in
a romantic light at all.

117
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:52,715
Poor thing.

118
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:54,554
Don't be so hard on him.

119
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,254
They could have a forbidden
love between brother and sister.

120
00:08:57,797 --> 00:08:59,059
You're right.

121
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,200
Ever since we were
kids, we knew our roles.

122
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:07,135
I think, and you make things happen.

123
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,837
He's right.

124
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:13,904
Makoto was the brains, I just
made his ideas come to fruition...

125
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,405
See, it worked, didn't it?

126
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:17,073
Yeah.

127
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:18,874
Shoplifting is a cinch.

128
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:21,009
I'll take this then.

129
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:21,883
Wait!

130
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:23,352
Aren't we splitting it?

131
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:27,984
I taught you how to do it, so
you can do it on your own now.

132
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:33,092
It's like I always say, use
your brain from time to time.

133
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:37,464
I'd love to rub his nose it.

134
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:42,834
If I don't, I'm always
going to be his yes-man.

135
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,345
You're here...

136
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:54,049
What do you mean?

137
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:56,849
I've been knocking
and calling your name.

138
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:59,854
Sorry, I was thinking
so I didn't hear you.

139
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,954
I baked some cookies for us.

140
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:03,987
Great.

141
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:08,463
Were you thinking about the railroad?

142
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:09,967
...about your next job?

143
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:12,162
Yeah, sort of.

144
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:14,729
Being a grown up must be hard.

145
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,569
We're only four years apart.

146
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:20,303
It's not that much.

147
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,540
Four years is a lot.

148
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:26,140
I'm nowhere near being a woman.

149
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:28,644
You've got a good head
on your shoulders, Sana.

150
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:31,688
You're much more grown up than I am.

151
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,554
Do you really think that?

152
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:35,160
Then let me ask you something.

153
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:37,627
Can you see me in a romantic light?

154
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:41,424
Can you imagine marrying
me and having a family?

155
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:47,395
Even if you said yes, there's
no way she sees you that way.

156
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,136
I don't know about that...

157
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:51,670
See!

158
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:54,372
You think I'm just a child!

159
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,172
No, that's not it.

160
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:58,875
It's just because we grew up together.

161
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:01,743
Fine, I see how it is.

162
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:03,350
I'm leaving.

163
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:05,390
You can clean up.

164
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:09,887
Oh, that's right.

165
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:11,926
One of my friends said she was...

166
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:16,364
...attacked by a pervert when she
was on your train the other day.

167
00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:20,205
I didn't hear about that.

168
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:21,600
That must have been horrible.

169
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:25,207
Please keep an eye out.

170
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:29,545
Stopping perverts is part of
your job as a railroad employee.

171
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:31,543
You're right.

172
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:33,915
It's hard for us girls.

173
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,281
Some girls are so scared
they can't say anything...

174
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:40,081
...and no one around will say anything...

175
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:44,419
So the train is a sort
of haven for perverts.

176
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:56,337
Going out of business
is going to devastate us.

177
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:57,835
The only people who use...

178
00:11:58,444 --> 00:12:01,436
...this line are the residents
of the last stop, Momokawa.

179
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:06,711
Even if we run the trains
normally, ridership won't increase.

180
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:11,422
Even if we run the trains normally,
it's not going to increase revenues.

181
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,155
If we operate it normally...

182
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:19,762
The Sleazy Train, departing...

183
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,358
Sleazy Train?

184
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:25,164
Like a fantasy play?

185
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:26,329
That's right.

186
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:32,336
If we could act out pervert fantasies in
a real train, we'd get loads of customers.

187
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:36,712
If we charge regular fares, and
the company is kept in the dark...

188
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:38,841
...they would just think
ridership increased.

189
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:39,915
That's stupid!

190
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:41,653
What about the girls?

191
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:44,546
If you have to hire girls,
that's going to increase costs.

192
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:48,559
It'll be way too much trouble
and won't lead to any profits.

193
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:49,355
He's right.

194
00:12:49,595 --> 00:12:51,620
Leave the girls to me.

195
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:53,695
I'll find them.

196
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:54,858
You'll find them?

197
00:12:56,135 --> 00:12:58,365
As if you had any leads.

198
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:03,133
But just in case, can
you use the internet...

199
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:06,767
...to find women who are into
pervert or rape fantasies?

200
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,679
You too, Inoue.

201
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:11,312
Sure.

202
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:14,876
Do you have a better idea, Makoto?

203
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:16,513
No, I don't.

204
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:26,965
In order to keep the railroad
from going out of business...

205
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:29,193
...I decided to use my
secret pervert technique.

206
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:34,195
I would use my fingers to
turn women into sex monsters.

207
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,765
I would turn them into
bottomless sex pits.

208
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:56,959
Ma'am.

209
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,455
Yamamoto, what do you want?

210
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,095
Can I help you prepare
for the conference?

211
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:07,161
That would take even longer.

212
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:09,699
You can't even do your own job.

213
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:12,403
Why are you even thinking
of helping others do theirs?

214
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:13,937
Sorry.

215
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:18,811
You're so harsh.

216
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:23,313
He doesn't get the
message any other way.

217
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:26,721
Calm down.

218
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:29,890
There's a conference in here at two.

219
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:31,156
We have to be done by then.

220
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,226
Just over an hour.

221
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,542
This is amazing.

222
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:48,169
It's never felt this good.

223
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:49,736
That's good.

224
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:51,282
This is really good.

225
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,784
My instincts were right.

226
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:59,720
Do you want something
other than my fingers?

227
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:01,816
Anything.

228
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:03,952
You can stick anything in me.

229
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,264
How about sticking in it yourself?

230
00:15:09,568 --> 00:15:11,559
It's so good.

231
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,103
I see.

232
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:16,305
But you treat the male
employees like dirt...

233
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:19,104
...and here you are playing with a
vibrator in the conference room.

234
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:21,508
And you're loving it so much.

235
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,109
Please.

236
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,178
There's not much time.

237
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:27,979
The vibrator is good but
I want the real thing.

238
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:28,849
I see.

239
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,682
Then take the vibrator out.

240
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:34,352
You can't stop?

241
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:38,529
Too bad then.

242
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:43,432
I guess this is the only hole then.

243
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:46,665
Does it hurt?

244
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:49,805
A bigger one is coming.

245
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:52,409
It's my first time.

246
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:56,075
Don't worry, the pain will stop.

247
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,622
See, just like I told you.

248
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:11,125
My whole body is tingling.

249
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:13,397
I feel it in my whole body.

250
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,191
Are you ready?

251
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,766
What's wrong?

252
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,272
It has to go deeper for it to be good.

253
00:16:57,276 --> 00:17:01,076
How can you lick something
that was in your own ass?

254
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,405
You must be really kinky.

255
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:06,445
If you can do that, you can do anything.

256
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:11,545
Yes, I'll do anything fo you.

257
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:13,880
That's a good girl.

258
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:16,921
Good girls get rewards.

259
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:42,616
Yes.

260
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:46,219
It's Y-Yamamoto.

261
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:52,556
Regarding the invoice,
how should I itemize it?

262
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,792
Don't call me with
such stupid questions!

263
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:57,592
S-Sorry.

264
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:02,806
You can ask all your questions later.

265
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,440
You must be a very good boss.

266
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:09,978
Who cares about that.

267
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,442
Just do me harder.

268
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:15,279
Ordering me around?

269
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:21,983
Have you already forgotten
who calls the shots?

270
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:24,761
Please forgive me, master.

271
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:28,262
Please let me come.

272
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,099
Please!

273
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,000
Fine then.

274
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:44,005
Are you satisfied?

275
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:44,912
It's so good.

276
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:46,475
I'm going to die!

277
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:49,312
Then here we go!

278
00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:52,387
C-come!

279
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:54,584
Please come all over me!

280
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:09,906
That's one.

281
00:19:10,976 --> 00:19:12,603
There's a line.

282
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:14,339
Word already got out.

283
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:15,277
Word got out?

284
00:19:15,347 --> 00:19:17,247
What, you didn't know?

285
00:19:17,382 --> 00:19:21,785
That girl, she wants to be groped,
so she rides the rush hour trains...

286
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:25,789
...but she doesn't mind at all,
so there's no thrill in it.

287
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:27,415
But she's a good back-up.

288
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:28,083
Oh?

289
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:32,823
I'll let you have her today.

290
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:35,661
You'll never lay hands on her again.

291
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:36,257
What?

292
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:00,153
She wants to be touched
during her period.

293
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:01,658
She's kinky.

294
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:19,140
A woman on her period is
good every now and then.

295
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:35,020
Why do you want to be groped?

296
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,586
Well...

297
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,490
You don't want to answer?

298
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,163
You don't have to if you don't want to.

299
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,899
I'll ask the mouth down there.

300
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:57,276
You're a virgin.

301
00:20:57,949 --> 00:20:58,711
Yes.

302
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,912
Don't worry.

303
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:06,514
Your body wants a man so
bad, it can hardly stand it.

304
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:08,081
It'll be fine.

305
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:10,517
It'll be all better soon.

306
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:37,351
You're feeling good.

307
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:43,421
It feels kind of strange.

308
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:46,995
This feeling is supposed to feel good?

309
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,767
Save your questions for later.

310
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:53,095
Just let your body give
in to what it feels.

311
00:21:53,638 --> 00:21:54,263
Yes.

312
00:22:00,345 --> 00:22:01,539
That's right.

313
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:02,602
That's good.

314
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,045
It feels good.

315
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:09,017
My body is so hot.

316
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:11,188
I feel all tingly!

317
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:12,518
I'm going crazy!

318
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:14,687
It's good!

319
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,692
It's good!

320
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,190
That was good.

321
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,402
You worked up a sweat,
and you're all dirty...

322
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,903
Shall we take a shower?

323
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:28,164
Yes.

324
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:30,208
Don't move.

325
00:22:31,176 --> 00:22:36,204
So, your parents expect
you to get top grades...

326
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:39,345
...you are ignored and
ostracized at school...

327
00:22:39,885 --> 00:22:42,786
It must have been so stressful for you.

328
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:46,724
Am I a freak?

329
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:48,055
No.

330
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,226
Everyone wants to have
contact with other people.

331
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:56,462
In your case, that contact
came from a pervert...

332
00:22:56,535 --> 00:23:00,528
...and you got hooked on it.

333
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:03,230
It's nothing to worry about.

334
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,634
Thank god.

335
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:08,913
By the way, there's this
interesting kind of party...

336
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,844
A party?

337
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:11,743
Are you interested?

338
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,978
No, I'm not so good at parties.

339
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:18,248
Great, I'll count you in.

340
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:19,524
But I...

341
00:23:19,591 --> 00:23:20,615
It's fine.

342
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:24,360
The back door's next.

343
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:26,496
Get on all fours.

344
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:30,762
That's two.

345
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:34,133
At this rate, we'll have
more than I expected.

346
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:45,005
I'd like to welcome you all.

347
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:48,108
First you must buy
your tickets over here.

348
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,051
Then you will pass
through the ticket gates.

349
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:57,552
This limited express train will
depart at 1:15 as scheduled.

350
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,458
This way please.

351
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:03,458
Makoto, all of the perverts are on.

352
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,259
The blinds and doors are okay too.

353
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:06,269
Let her roll.

354
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:07,536
Yeah, yeah.

355
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:11,098
There's no way this'll
keep us in business.

356
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:23,087
Next stop, Kitasato, Kitasato.

357
00:24:23,522 --> 00:24:27,219
Please take your belongings
when leaving the train.

358
00:24:35,634 --> 00:24:37,226
Here we go.

359
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:41,400
Midnight Sleazy Train, ready to depart.

360
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,168
Ready...

361
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,233
Go!

362
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:34,784
In this train does not
prohibit illicit contact.

363
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:38,558
If there is anything that you have always
wanted to do but are forbidden to do...

364
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,122
...please take this opportunity to
enjoy yourselves to your satisfaction.

365
00:26:35,987 --> 00:26:37,420
Ma'am!

366
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,318
Yamamoto!

367
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,485
Ma'am, me too...

368
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,228
It feels so good, ma'am.

369
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:52,199
I can't believe you
are doing this for me.

370
00:26:52,604 --> 00:26:56,563
I won't ever cause
you any problems again...

371
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:10,445
Chihiro...

372
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:11,983
Mom!

373
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:21,488
Mom, you too?

374
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,235
Chihiro, you...

375
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:29,335
Mom, for the first time ever,
I've been honest with myself.

376
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,833
I am so happy.

377
00:27:33,878 --> 00:27:36,005
Chihiro, don't tell your father.

378
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:38,444
Yes, mother!

379
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:15,147
We're approaching our
last stop, Momokawa.

380
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:19,814
Please be sure to
withdraw your valuables.

381
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,750
A great success.

382
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,929
It's later than usual...

383
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:31,565
...the last train...

384
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,631
I wonder if Tetsuo is driving it.

385
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:40,506
Good work, Tetsuo...

386
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:44,004
Thank you for always
making the trains run.

387
00:28:45,483 --> 00:28:46,450
Tetsuo...
