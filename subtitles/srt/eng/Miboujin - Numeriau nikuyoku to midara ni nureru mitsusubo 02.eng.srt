1
00:01:55,949 --> 00:02:04,482
<i>Widow, Chapter 2</i>

2
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,244
My head hurts.

3
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:48,734
It's good.

4
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,099
Taeko prepared it, huh?

5
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,694
How nice.

6
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,911
Master Satoshi!

7
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,190
For me?

8
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:53,124
The postmark for the town, as
well as the sender, is unknown.

9
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,870
I wonder if Uncle is awake.

10
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,143
He seemed very tired last night.

11
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,496
Uncle.

12
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,532
Come here, Chiyoko.

13
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,395
Uncle...

14
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:46,076
Your fingers are going into my pussy.

15
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,749
Now, I'll make you feel much better.

16
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,752
It's embarrassing.

17
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,889
Uncle...

18
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,701
Chiyoko, you're beautiful.

19
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,900
Uncle!

20
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,154
Uncle, it tickles.

21
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,063
It feels strange.

22
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,642
Uncle, it's embarrassing.

23
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,685
Your pussy's gotten very soft.

24
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,558
I think I can stick
something big inside.

25
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,565
It's okay, you can stick it in.

26
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,027
Chiyoko.

27
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,068
Spread your pussy wide open.

28
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,008
Like this?

29
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,539
Your huge thing...

30
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,078
Is it going to fit inside?

31
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,082
I'm ready, Chiyoko.

32
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,723
It hurts!

33
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,590
It hurts, stop it!

34
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,996
Uncle!

35
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,077
Uncle, please don't move!

36
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,617
I can't do that, Chiyoko.

37
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,617
It hurts, uncle!

38
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,910
It hurts!

39
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,687
Stop, Uncle.

40
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,267
No, not yet Chiyoko.

41
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,372
Now, Chiyoko, let's finish up.

42
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,280
Uncle, let's stop.

43
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,239
I'm ready to come, Chiyoko.

44
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,688
Chiyoko.

45
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,160
From now on, I'm your master.

46
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,943
How many times is it now?

47
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,562
What a sex-craving asshole you are.

48
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,402
It's still wide open
and wanting more.

49
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,631
Don't say that.

50
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,882
This voice and this ass...

51
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,501
It must be.

52
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,045
That's for Kaoru.

53
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,350
You knew I was here?

54
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,351
You're early today.

55
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,344
Ah, well...

56
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,353
You worry too much...

57
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,122
...about Taeko, don't you?

58
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,089
Miyuki...

59
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,093
You're worried about me?

60
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,292
Yes.

61
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,127
Since Satoshi's younger brother Kaoru
is going to be living with Taeko...

62
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,099
...under the same roof for a while.

63
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,428
Hey Miyuki, you better stop...

64
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,734
Good morning.

65
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,365
You're very early today too, Miyuki.

66
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,781
Isn't this a good opportunity
to set things straight?

67
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,480
I'm sure you are aware of it but...

68
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,484
Toshiki has always...

69
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,894
What do you think of Toshiki?

70
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:43,825
What?

71
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,500
Good morning.

72
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,568
<i>Good morning Chiyoko.</i>
Good morning.

73
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,227
<i>Good morning Chiyoko.</i>

74
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:53,230
Good morning, Toshiki and Miyuki.

75
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,396
Good morning Chiyoko.

76
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,735
What's wrong?
You don't look very happy.

77
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,705
I feel fine.

78
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,145
Could you go wake up Kaoru for me?

79
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:09,483
Uncle said he's going out
to search for something.

80
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,248
What?

81
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,244
Oh, I see you were up
very early this morning.

82
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:37,010
Yes, I went to my lawyer to discuss
the paperwork for the inheritance...

83
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,741
...and I had to run other errands as well.

84
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,541
Did you eat?

85
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,187
I already ate.

86
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,649
By the way...

87
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,590
...where are Toshiki and Miyuki?

88
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,262
They're both tutoring
Chiyoko at the moment.

89
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,291
I see.

90
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:56,333
We need to talk, but I don't want them to
hear about it.

91
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:57,760
What is it?

92
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:02,365
You are aware of the envelope
that was addressed to me, right?

93
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,570
Yes.

94
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:08,136
I brought it to your room
along with the ice tea.

95
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,843
What do you think was inside?

96
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,484
Well, I don't know...

97
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,452
It was a video.

98
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,015
Video?

99
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,621
It was a wedding video
of you and my brother.

100
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,190
Video huh?

101
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,354
I wonder who sent it.

102
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:29,826
Well, it's more like footage
taken after the wedding.

103
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,764
After the wedding...

104
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,368
Would you like to have some wine?

105
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,373
Wine at this time of day?

106
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,880
There's an antique
wine cellar on the grounds.

107
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,813
Wine cellar...

108
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,110
...that sounds great.

109
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,614
Which do you prefer, red or white?

110
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,620
Then, red.

111
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,219
Wait one moment, please.

112
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,323
Sister.

113
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,631
May I join you?

114
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,130
Sure.

115
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,840
What's wrong? You look sad.

116
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,144
Huh?

117
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,382
Is it because you couldn't find Taeko?

118
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,145
She probably went shopping.

119
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,645
You like Taeko, don't you?

120
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,652
What do you mean?

121
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,150
Just answer my question!

122
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,661
It's not like that.

123
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:32,792
Liar!

124
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,661
You're in love with Taeko!

125
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,625
Stop saying that!

126
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,761
I know exactly what it is!

127
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,170
Does it matter whether
I like her or not?

128
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,738
Of course it does!

129
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,374
What Taeko said...

130
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,912
Does it bother you?

131
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:56,984
You want to know how I
feel about you, Toshiki?

132
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,418
Miyuki...

133
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,167
N-No!

134
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,305
Wait a minute, Toshiki!

135
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:20,738
What do you mean?

136
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,313
Don't say "no" to me now.

137
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,477
It's not that, it's just...

138
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,581
I wanna go to the bathroom.

139
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,520
There's no bathroom in this park.

140
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,156
Wait right there.

141
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,853
Miyuki!

142
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,760
Toshiki, no peeking!

143
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,302
Go away!

144
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,066
Let me see it, Miyuki.

145
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:49,567
What?

146
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,576
I want to take a look
at every part of you.

147
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,812
Is that okay?

148
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,543
Everything?

149
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,978
That sounds a bit perverted.

150
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,550
Well, all right...

151
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,550
But you have to let me see yours too.

152
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,056
Are you happy now?

153
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,228
Toshiki.

154
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,202
Miyu...

155
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,378
Miyuki, it feels great.

156
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,248
But don't you have to pee?

157
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,089
I'm fine, I can hold it a bit longer.

158
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,095
I want you to come first.

159
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,793
But after you come,
I want you to go away.

160
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,537
Then I won't come.

161
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,732
Besides, it's not good for
you to hold it in, Miyuki.

162
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:02,306
But I can't...

163
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,247
Let it out, Toshiki.

164
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,483
Miyuki...

165
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,490
I can't...

166
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,268
Miyuki, are you alright?

167
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,234
I'm okay.

168
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,132
Anyway, I need to...

169
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,541
Please, go away Toshiki.

170
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,870
Don't look.

171
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,008
Now it's time to show your stuff.

172
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,508
It's embarrassing.

173
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,630
Are you satisfied?

174
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,158
Miyuki.

175
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,269
H-Hey, Toshiki...

176
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:01,936
Ouch!

177
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,770
Don't bite so hard, Toshiki.

178
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,244
Toshiki, not there.

179
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,113
It's dirty.

180
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,657
I didn't wipe myself after peeing...

181
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,530
It's beautiful, Miyuki.

182
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,033
Let me see some more.

183
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,530
This isn't right, Toshiki.

184
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:39,907
What if someone sees us?

185
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,507
Don't worry.

186
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,347
Besides, don't you
want others to see you?

187
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,813
It's wet.

188
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,353
The juice is flowing out.

189
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,790
No, don't say that!

190
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,365
Are you ready, Miyuki?

191
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,277
Tell me if it hurts.

192
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,049
No, I'm fine.

193
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:39,938
Miyuki.

194
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,804
It's embarrassing, Toshiki.

195
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,546
Toshiki, I'm connecting with you.

196
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,594
Toshiki, I'm going to...

197
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,665
I'm out of gas too.

198
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,512
It feels good, Toshiki...

199
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,793
Me too, Miyuki.

200
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,301
No, not there!

201
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,877
It feels so tight, Miyuki.

202
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,246
Toshiki, I feel it in my ass.

203
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:40,657
Do it.

204
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,226
Come, Toshiki.

205
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,190
L-I'm going to...

206
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,207
M-Me too.

207
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,303
Do you like wine?

208
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,239
I like it but...

209
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,369
...I'm more used to drinking
the cheaper wines from the store.

210
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,241
You're just like your brother.

211
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,842
I didn't really have many
opportunities to drink with my brother.

212
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,243
I see.

213
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,456
My brother and I were always busy.

214
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,992
Did you drink with my brother often?

215
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,325
Yes.

216
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,187
It was just...

217
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,967
...maybe a sip or two.

218
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,707
The taste is very rich, and I can
appreciate the great taste and smell.

219
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,501
It's certainly wonderful.

220
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,546
We've had these for a while.

221
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,678
My father loved them.

222
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,012
We still have a lot more.

223
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:18,849
He was a playboy who
spent all his fortune.

224
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,754
Your family history is very interesting.

225
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,124
I always knew as a kid,
that you folks were rich...

226
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,754
...since you lived on top of the hill.

227
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:30,657
Coming from a wealthy household
doesn't really mean much.

228
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,771
In fact, it's uneasy and depressing.

229
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:36,739
My brother died here.

230
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:37,773
Am I right?

231
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,544
I'm very suspicious
about my brother's death.

232
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:46,309
My brother was very healthy, yet
he died of acute heart failure.

233
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,546
Plus the video that was sent to me
clearly shows you and my brother.

234
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,655
The footage also showed
these walls in here.

235
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:59,021
Yes, your brother did die here.

236
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,558
You carried his body out by yourself?

237
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:03,933
Yes.

238
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,265
I couldn't reveal this
place to the public eye.

239
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,638
What do you mean?

240
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,943
I was going to tell you sooner or later.

241
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,221
What is this place?

242
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,860
Is this my brother's studio?

243
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,660
That's right.

244
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,859
Satoshi built this place just for me.

245
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,395
My brother built this place for you?

246
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,540
What did you put in the wine?

247
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:00,921
Kaoru...

248
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,896
Welcome to the Sagayama family.
