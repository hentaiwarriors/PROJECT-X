1
00:00:05,898 --> 00:00:13,202
It was during the war... yes...
it was in the summer of 1943.

2
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:20,277
Jack was ten years older than me...

3
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:22,673
but he was my best friend.

4
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:28,318
When he came back home,
he completely lost the will to live.

5
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:31,911
Yes, he came home to die.

6
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:40,724
One night Jack left home by himself,
and went into the forest.

7
00:00:56,949 --> 00:00:58,439
Come out! Jack!

8
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:00,346
You can't get away!

9
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:09,391
Damn it!

10
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:10,560
Die!

11
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:17,996
He won't die!

12
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:24,667
You may not believe it,
but Jack was already...

13
00:01:25,677 --> 00:01:28,908
not human.

14
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,196
Please wait a moment.

15
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,760
Karl, can I talk to you?

16
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:51,595
What is it?

17
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,361
Well, I'm a private detective.

18
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:57,335
This is just out of professional
curiosity, call it a force of habit.

19
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,306
Yes?

20
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:01,609
Can you tell me your alibi?

21
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:03,772
Alibi?

22
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,715
There was a murder here.

23
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,210
I'm just a historian.

24
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:12,323
I was writing some report about
a historical site around here...

25
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:14,348
up until late last night.

26
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,584
And I was sleeping
in the morning.

27
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,719
I see.

28
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:24,732
I went to the historical site
for research in the afternoon.

29
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,961
So, I don't have any clear alibi.

30
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:36,008
But Marshall, your assistant told me
that those two women were still alive.

31
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:41,484
And you shot and killed
them in self-defense.

32
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,021
That means it's not a murder.

33
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:48,451
So, I wouldn't think checking
out my alibi is so important.

34
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:50,294
Well then, excuse me.

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,334
I was very scared when I
heard about the murders.

36
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:10,539
Can you take me to my room,
Mr. Suzusaki?

37
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:12,377
Sure, I can do that.

38
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:14,783
Oh, you look so happy.

39
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:19,083
Go ahead Chief. After all, this is
the country of "ladies first."

40
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:23,258
Something wrong?

41
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:25,555
It's nothing.

42
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:27,092
Let's go.

43
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,394
Stupid jerk!

44
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:36,236
I envy you, Asuka.

45
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:37,303
What?

46
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:40,943
You guys don't act like brother and
sister, but boyfriend and girlfriend.

47
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:42,677
Huh?

48
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:45,579
No, it's just like a couple who has
been married for a long time.

49
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:48,348
There's some warm feelings.

50
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:52,389
Oh, it's open.

51
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,730
W... what is it Clark?!

52
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,166
Why are you in my room?!

53
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:06,964
I'll leave you two alone.

54
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:09,404
I'm going back to my room.

55
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:22,252
Why do you have to seduce
men, one after the other?!

56
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:26,720
Why do you hit me all the time?!

57
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,987
I can do anything I want to!

58
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:38,597
I'm sick of you! Get out!

59
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,098
Why are you attracted
to such a nerdy guy?

60
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,500
Hey! Don't be crazy!

61
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:50,606
Amy, show me your ass.

62
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:51,445
No!

63
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:55,544
Clark, stop it!
Not there!

64
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,281
Shut up!

65
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,159
Amy! Do you feel good?

66
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:38,386
Yes! Yes!

67
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,260
Clark!

68
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:51,037
You!
You're the one who...!

69
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,279
But how old are you!?

70
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:58,773
You talked too much!

71
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:01,676
I'm thirsty.

72
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:03,377
I want some alcohol.

73
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,787
Why don't we get some from
the old man next door.

74
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:07,356
I'll go with you.

75
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:15,426
Satoshi, come up to the second floor!

76
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,023
There's been another murder.

77
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:18,733
No!

78
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:30,848
It's not working!

79
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:34,545
I can't call the police station.
The phone line is dead.

80
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:36,046
What does that mean?

81
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:40,315
Because of the storm, the phone lines
may be cut off somewhere.

82
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,720
What can we do, Mr. Suzusaki?

83
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:46,960
Well, let's leave the
crime scene as it is.

84
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,163
I'm more worried about
the other guests.

85
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,995
Let's split up and look around.

86
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,170
All right.

87
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,241
This is...!

88
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:09,583
Miskatonic University

90
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,093
Ms. Amy?

91
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,710
Karl, are you there?

92
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:40,273
This is...

93
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:46,123
Mr. Suzusaki, Clark
wasn't in his room.

94
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,114
Neither was Ms. Amy.

95
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:50,627
Karl must be Nezu.

96
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:56,524
This is Nozomi's!

97
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,636
Are you feeling sick?

98
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,502
You have to be patient,
just a little more.

99
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:13,844
Everything will be over soon.
You will become part of me.

100
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,079
My loving child!

101
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,150
Nozomi, I understand.

102
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:22,953
You don't recognize
that I'm your father.

103
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:30,394
I know I don't look like your father,
but that's only on the outside.

104
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:41,512
Yes, the soul is completely the same.
Your father's soul is in my body.

105
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:46,047
I even have the memories of
when you were born.

106
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,920
This is the most definitive magic
book in the world, the Necronomicon.

107
00:08:57,195 --> 00:09:00,892
It's also called "Kuro No Dansho",
a book of the devil.

108
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:06,300
Do you understand?
This book has the power of the devil.

109
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:11,337
This book can protect itself
with it's own power.

110
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:14,942
It erases the memory of people
who are against it.

111
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:23,580
The memories of Suzusaki and Bill have been
sealed by the power of this book.

112
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,115
But that ended yesterday.

113
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,883
And tomorrow it will be Beltane.

114
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,621
The power of this book will be
gone temporarily.

115
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:33,954
Suzusaki will come here to save you.

116
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,960
And they will all die here!

117
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:43,869
Oh no, you had an accident?

118
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:47,209
But you're my child,
so don't worry.

119
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:49,336
I'll clean you up now.

120
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,954
Bill!

121
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,697
What happened?

122
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,829
I... I just remembered what
happened six years ago.

123
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:17,068
It's here! We went to that
cursed place from here!

124
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:22,605
Satoshi, are you all right?

125
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,345
Yes! H... here!

126
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:28,781
I found it! Satoshi... Nora!

127
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:30,052
Is it here?

128
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:32,113
There's a stairway.

129
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:38,456
It was here!

130
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:42,125
I remembered that we went
to the place from here!

131
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:47,026
But why couldn't I remember
this, until today?

132
00:10:54,312 --> 00:11:01,411
Well, here are the entry records from
March through April. Karl Ihiman...

133
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:03,954
This is strange...

134
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,006
This must be some kind of set up.
He must of cut the phone line, too.

135
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:28,471
But why?

136
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:30,173
Tomorrow is Beltane.

137
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:35,685
Whatever ceremony he performs with
Nozomi will have to be tomorrow night.

138
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,644
But it's dangerous.

139
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:38,620
I know.

140
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:41,422
Please save Nozomi!

141
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:43,684
Don't worry about it.

142
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:45,953
I'll save her.
Even at the cost of my life.

143
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,395
I won't let anybody die
around me anymore.

144
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:50,556
Brother.

145
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:52,135
You should stay here.

146
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,107
Only Bill and I will go downstairs
tomorrow morning.

147
00:11:57,575 --> 00:11:58,303
No!

148
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,100
I'll go with you, no matter what!

149
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:03,513
Please take me, too!
I want to save Nozomi!

150
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:09,743
Akiko, Nozomi's mother,
asked me to take care of her.

151
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:12,648
I'm Nozomi's guardian.

152
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:15,255
I can't just wait here
and do nothing.

153
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:28,772
Are you still awake?

154
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:29,465
Yes.

155
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:32,907
I must go with you downstairs.

156
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:33,909
You can't!

157
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:35,008
Why?

158
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:40,380
I don't want to see
people die anymore.

159
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:45,654
I couldn't help Nora
six years ago, and your...

160
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:48,917
You might be the one
who killed my parents.

161
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:51,687
How do you know that?

162
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:55,196
I read the newspaper article at the
library the day before yesterday.

163
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:59,035
But I love you brother... no

164
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:01,768
I love you Satoshi Suzusaki.

165
00:13:02,206 --> 00:13:03,195
Asuka.

166
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,101
Thank you.

167
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:11,613
But I might be the one
who killed your parents.

168
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:13,773
Don't you mind?

169
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:14,712
No.

170
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:19,682
I know Satoshi Suzusaki is not a
person who could do such a thing.

171
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,621
Even if you killed my parents...

172
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:26,755
it doesn't change my feelings.

173
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:28,654
Asuka.

174
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,128
Women can be
dangerous sometimes.

175
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,874
Make love to me!

176
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:45,972
I was all by myself in a strange town
after my mother and father died.

177
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:50,043
It was five years ago...

178
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:56,994
But there was a person
who came and took me.

179
00:13:57,362 --> 00:14:00,763
He was a man who wasn't so good at
expressing his feelings to other people...

180
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:02,729
He was kind of a loser.

181
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:06,134
He wasn't perfect, but he
was a very nice person.

182
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:10,571
I don't care about the reason
why you took care of me.

183
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:14,338
I love you, Satoshi Suzusaki.

184
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:15,409
Asuka.

185
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:37,363
Huh?

186
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:42,039
This is the lucky charm that
you gave me on my birthday.

187
00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:45,167
I wear this all the time.

188
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:52,040
Aquamarine is supposed to have
the power to protect you from evil.

189
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,745
But that stone is not very expensive.

190
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:58,446
It's important because
you gave it to me.

191
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,091
I don't understand.

192
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:46,994
There is no such thing as a human
who never ages in this world.

193
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,423
Marshall!

194
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:50,663
What is it?

195
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:53,135
L... Look at this!

196
00:16:56,941 --> 00:17:02,311
Marshall, there are no records
of a Karl Ihiman...

197
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:05,880
but the picture that you gave to me...

198
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:08,879
...but I found an entry
record of this person.

199
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,578
It was one month ago.

200
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:14,117
Of course he used a fake name.

201
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:16,352
Marshall?

202
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,189
Satoshi.

203
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:23,025
Yes.

204
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:30,073
I'm sure about this.
It's here.

205
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:39,182
You're...

206
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,439
Clark!

207
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,110
Why are you here?

208
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:46,689
It's no good.
He's already become a zombie.

209
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:50,554
The same as Rumiko and Kate.

210
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,389
And Jack, who Louis mentioned.

211
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,363
What?

212
00:17:56,434 --> 00:18:00,734
And all the mysteries about the
murders are behind this gate.

213
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,832
And probably Nozomi, too.

214
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:05,130
Nozomi!

215
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:07,672
Ms. Sakimizu!

216
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:14,381
It doesn't work on him.

217
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:16,810
Bill! Shoot him in the head!

218
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:43,612
Satoshi, get inside there now!

219
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:46,338
Hurry!

220
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:50,747
You two stay back!!

221
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:53,853
Damn you!

222
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:00,056
Satoshi! Let's get inside now!

223
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:02,060
All right! Let's go!

224
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:11,608
Bill!

225
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:14,334
There's no time left!

226
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:16,503
I'll take care of this.

227
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,006
Bill!

228
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,052
Please save Nozomi.

229
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:25,818
Bill!

230
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,879
Bill!

231
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,691
Welcome to my party.

232
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,158
Nozomi!

233
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:40,762
If you come any closer than you are!

234
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:42,270
Nezu!

235
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:46,639
You arrived here much earlier
than I expected Mr. Suzusaki.

236
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:48,742
What are you trying to do to Nozomi?

237
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:49,609
Nezu!

238
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:51,881
I'm just having a party.

239
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,247
Today is Beltane.

240
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:56,011
The best day to have a ceremony.

241
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:57,315
What?

242
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:04,452
Before you worry about this girl,
why don't you worry about yourself...

243
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,089
or the friend you left outside the door?

244
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:10,561
Or are you going to just let them die?

245
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:12,896
Just like you did to your
girlfriend six years ago?

246
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:16,305
Run away, Satoshi!

247
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:21,011
I wasn't the one who killed Nora!

248
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:24,375
Yes, I killed her.

249
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:27,581
I let you know this now...

250
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:30,178
because your memory will come
back to you soon anyway.

251
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:31,512
What are you talking about?

252
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:35,419
I will reenact the scene
from that time in front of you.

253
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,390
However, the people who
were lying on this table...

254
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:40,226
were Professor
Kashiwagi and his wife.

255
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:41,421
You're evil, not human!

256
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:42,759
Not human?

257
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:45,797
Dear lady, you will not
be human very soon.

258
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,904
Just like the two
people you saw outside.

259
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:52,932
And I'll combine Nozomi's
soul with mine...

260
00:20:52,977 --> 00:20:57,573
and have a perfect body and soul
to complete the Family Circle.

261
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:00,080
What are you trying to do?!

262
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,152
Do you know this book?

263
00:21:04,155 --> 00:21:06,453
The book describes the magic
to get eternal life.

264
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,616
The Necronomicon.

265
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,091
I see.

266
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,328
You've researched up
to that point, Mr. Suzusaki.

267
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:18,694
You killed all the people who knew
about it or were involved with it.

268
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:24,736
Then I assume you already
know my real name too.

269
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:26,436
Herbert West!

270
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:28,272
Marshall Perkins!!

271
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:31,247
You were a former professor
of the medical department...

272
00:21:31,282 --> 00:21:33,079
at Miskatonic University.

273
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,641
Herbert West!

274
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,818
The university didn't approve your
research on reviving the dead.

275
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,120
You quit the University with your
assistant, Toshiaki Nezu...

276
00:21:42,193 --> 00:21:44,218
...and opened the laboratory here.

277
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:47,589
And you killed Nezu,
and stole his body.

278
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:48,790
You are evil!

279
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:51,827
Marshall!

280
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:55,301
I don't think I invited
you to this party.

281
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:59,631
You're under arrest for mass murder!

282
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:06,506
Do you think you can hurt me
with such a crude device?

283
00:22:06,984 --> 00:22:07,973
What?!

284
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:15,553
Who is this?

285
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,849
Akiko!

286
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:35,909
Nezu!

287
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,346
What did you do
to Nozomi's mother?!

288
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:42,078
Can't you see?
I gave her immortality.

289
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,623
Of course if I don't perform the
ceremony on the day of Beltane...

290
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,125
her soul will die.

291
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:50,317
Damn you!

292
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:53,396
Mr. Suzusaki!

293
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:56,025
Stop it, Akiko!

294
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:57,295
Stop it!

295
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,096
Stop it!

296
00:23:00,804 --> 00:23:05,639
Akiko, don't let them bother
me until I finish the ceremony!

297
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:36,973
Help me!

298
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:38,539
Mother!

299
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,345
Nozomi!

300
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:47,174
Damn it!

301
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:51,745
You bastard!

302
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,288
Fool!

303
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:01,429
Let me scoop out your heart.

304
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:04,325
No don't!

305
00:24:08,372 --> 00:24:10,101
Stop doing this!

306
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:11,636
Brother! Run!

307
00:24:16,513 --> 00:24:17,741
Y... you bastard!

308
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:25,545
Run Satoshi!

309
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:27,487
Let me go!
I have to save Nora!

310
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:31,459
We should go Satoshi.
Don't waste Nora's feelings.

311
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:37,593
Boy, are you afraid of death?

312
00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:40,628
Run Satoshi!

313
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:46,937
Nora!

314
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,512
Fire!

315
00:24:52,516 --> 00:24:55,508
He was very afraid of real fire.

316
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:12,600
Su... Suzusaki!

317
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:18,263
Akiko!

318
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:19,943
Let me go!

319
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,133
Mother!

320
00:25:21,178 --> 00:25:22,076
Nozomi.

321
00:25:25,015 --> 00:25:26,380
Asuka, run!

322
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:32,983
Let me go! Akiko!

323
00:25:38,395 --> 00:25:40,420
The Necronomicon...

324
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:42,429
Kill me!

325
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:12,259
Mother.

326
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:13,654
Nozomi.

327
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:19,331
Perkins, nobody will believe
what happened here today.

328
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,728
I know.

329
00:26:20,971 --> 00:26:22,939
