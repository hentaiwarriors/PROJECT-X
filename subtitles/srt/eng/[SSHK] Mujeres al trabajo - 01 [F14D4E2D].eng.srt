1
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,426
What?

2
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,903
I'm happy you feel that way but...

3
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,734
Plus you seem like a nice-looking guy...

4
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:16,968
Sort of...

5
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:22,169
But it looks like you're a wimp.

6
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,106
I see...

7
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:30,513
I'll pass.

8
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,281
Pass?

9
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,158
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,997
But it looks like you're a wimp.

11
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,871
Wimp...

12
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,220
You got huge muscles!

13
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,383
It's marvelous! Make love to me!

14
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,725
I've been dumped by my girl and she said I'm a wimp...

15
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,855
Men should be strong.

16
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,636
Who is this guy?

17
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,002
Weirdo!

18
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,989
Now Hiring

19
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,494
Workers wanted?

20
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,662
Workers wanted for a construction site...

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,694
Robust...

22
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:49,835
Body...

23
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,003
Gutsy...

24
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,593
High salary...

25
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,073
Yeah!

26
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,234
Times are getting better.

27
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,780
If I work at a construction site, it'll be much better than going to a gym.

28
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,316
I can really get a workout.

29
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,416
If I go to a gym, they'll charge me money.

30
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,716
But if I work at a construction site, they'll give me money.

31
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,523
This is a nice idea!

32
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,319
I can do this!

33
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,520
No, I can really do this!

34
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,029
Muscles and money, killing two birds with one stone...

35
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,069
Easy money...

36
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,672
Like driving a stake into sawdust...

37
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,104
Opps, my bad...

38
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,405
I'll workout like crazy and I'll show her what I can do!

39
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,174
I'll work and get a massive body...

40
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,818
I'll soon be attractive!

41
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,649
Just you wait!

42
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,358
Physical labor!

43
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,018
I'll show them!

44
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:03,366
Women at Work

45
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,244
My name is Hiroko Miike and I'm in charge.

46
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,383
Sorry to keep you waiting.

47
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,555
I looked at your resume.

48
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,626
For the time being...

49
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,354
I don't see any problems.

50
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,891
But can you really work at a construction site?

51
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,402
You look like a wimp.

52
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,098
Are you sure you want to do this?

53
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,538
I can handle it!

54
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,037
You know something, boy?

55
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,443
You can't make it in this world on attitude alone.

56
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,707
Do you understand?

57
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,310
All right.

58
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,785
Then I'll be nice and give you a test.

59
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,184
Is that ok?

60
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,517
Really?

61
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,252
Thank you very much!

62
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,193
What?

63
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,859
Go and prepare for the test.

64
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,963
Now, you have exactly 10 minutes.

65
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,701
Go!

66
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,568
Go!

67
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,950
Go!

68
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,022
What do you mean go?

69
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,653
I'm just trying to test your strength.

70
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,286
Didn't you learn that in school?

71
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,996
We'll be conducting a nationwide exam starting next year.

72
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:43,738
Or are you thinking that you can't do it with me since I'm older?

73
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,943
No, of course not.

74
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,672
Stand up!

75
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,745
Yes!

76
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,415
It's really standing up.

77
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,148
Of course.

78
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,091
Wow, it looks strong.

79
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,292
Strong?

80
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,262
We'll begin the test.

81
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,203
Yes!

82
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,287
Test...

83
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,984
This is an actual test, right?

84
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,253
I have to do it if it's a test.

85
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,694
You passed the first part.

86
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,562
Now let's go with the second part.

87
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,438
Shove that mighty stick inside me.

88
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,337
I passed the first part...

89
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,272
Mighty stick...

90
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,707
Yes! I'll shove it inside!

91
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,878
Like this?

92
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,022
You can move faster if you want.

93
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,121
Yes!

94
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,695
Give it to me faster...

95
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,032
Faster...

96
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,532
Yes, that's it!

97
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,734
That's it, keep it going.

98
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,607
You got it?

99
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,476
Faster! Faster!

100
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,716
You're good.

101
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,851
You have more strength than I thought.

102
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,588
You passed the second part.

103
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,792
Thank you very much.

104
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,193
Now comes the last part.

105
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,565
Just do your best until the very end!

106
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,466
Yes!

107
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,960
He's good.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,436
Go on and release it inside!

109
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,702
Are you sure?

110
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,772
I'm coming!

111
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,803
You're pretty good.

112
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,441
You're hired.

113
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,271
I guess I'll have you start working today...

114
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,811
Thank you very much.

115
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,751
Starting today?

116
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,520
If you can't, then I won't hire you.

117
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,294
No, of course I'll start.

118
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,795
I'll be happy to start working today!

119
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,127
Out of the way!

120
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,131
Out of the way!

121
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,378
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,310
I was in a rush.

123
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,743
What's going on?

124
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,855
Well, I was in a hurry, and...

125
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,064
I got what you said.

126
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,931
So please...

127
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,701
Try not to talk with your mouth full.

128
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,066
I'll climax!

129
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,543
I'm coming!

130
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,325
Sorry about that.

131
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,895
I know this is none of my business but...

132
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:39,301
...you should get some iron in your diet.

133
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,268
I have to go now.

134
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,070
Excuse me...

135
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,407
Who was that?

136
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,281
Oh, you don't have to worry about her.

137
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:52,942
Huh?

138
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,751
Harumi Tanigawa.

139
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,345
I hired her to provide us with tea but, she's a bit...

140
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,788
...no, she's really a natural.

141
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,382
You'll find out soon.

142
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,803
Yo, what's up?

143
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,002
Yuck!

144
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,442
Did you just say "Yuck"?

145
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,147
Really?

146
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,584
All righty then.

147
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,283
But you shouldn't look so surprised.

148
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,817
You're very rude.

149
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:40,494
Seeing a woman work at a construction site might be rare, but...

150
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,157
Okay, okay.

151
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,030
Don't pick on the young workers.

152
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,336
Hey, introduce yourself.

153
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,202
All right!

154
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,241
I'm in charge of this site...

155
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,273
Harumi!

156
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,608
We needed more lunch boxes!

157
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,712
Don't eat me...

158
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,652
I'll eat you...

159
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,617
Hey rookie!

160
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:08,623
Let's go to work!

161
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,288
Yes!

162
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:16,201
People sometimes go through events that change their lives.

163
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,698
I honestly didn't believe that at all...

164
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,363
...until today.

165
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:28,009
I can't believe it's at a construction site in middle of a filthy city...

166
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,951
Women at Work

167
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,357
Now that I've been hired...

168
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:52,961
...I'll work like crazy to make money and train my body...

169
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,437
I know I shouldn't be whining like this, but...

170
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:03,571
...why are these bags so heavy?

171
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,447
Hey! What are you doing, you slowpoke?

172
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,179
Keep it going!

173
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,720
Sorry.

174
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,680
Aren't they heavy?

175
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,093
I can't believe they're making you carry those by yourself.

176
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,991
My name is Akira Hayasaka.

177
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,127
I'll be working with you from now on.

178
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,756
Nice to meet you.

179
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,662
Oh, I'm Akiyoshi.

180
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,531
Nice to meet you too.

181
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,543
No, no.

182
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,243
Am I going gaga?

183
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,186
I don't know if this is a girl or a guy... but I'm getting excited...

184
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:46,586
Yo.

185
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,417
Looks like you guys already met each other.

186
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,726
Sorry I couldn't introduce myself earlier.

187
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,330
My name is Minako Takahara.

188
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,036
Call me Taka.

189
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,274
She's very rough.

190
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,305
But she doesn't seem like a bad person.

191
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,991
Damn! Here she comes...

192
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,197
Who could it be this time?

193
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,280
Miss!

194
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,885
You always show up to work like a princess.

195
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,853
Hey, these are the rookies...

196
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:55,085
There's no need for you to introduce them!

197
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,763
She's really gorgeous!

198
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,623
I'm guessing she's the president's daughter...

199
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:06,431
...or maybe she's the president's lover.

200
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,459
Expensive workclothes...

201
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,429
I didn't know they made those things...

202
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,236
You look very weak.

203
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,999
Can you really work with a body like that?

204
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,801
Whatever.

205
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,504
I just hope you don't get in my way.

206
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,943
Her name is Mutsuki Oshima.

207
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,209
Also known as "the Princess."

208
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,182
You can tell her personality just by looking at her.

209
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,379
Don't you worry about her.

210
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,153
What a complicated world.

211
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:07,366
Maybe I'm lost in a parallel world...

212
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,168
Okay everyone!

213
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,361
Get to work!

214
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,806
We're behind schedule, you know.

215
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,442
Let's put some energy into this!

216
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:26,017
Women at Work

217
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,148
Time for lunch.

218
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,884
Hey rookie, time for lunch.

219
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,057
I'll be right there.

220
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,536
Here's your lunch!

221
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,474
Try to savor it.

222
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,608
I can't...

223
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,548
I'm too tired to eat...

224
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,487
Here's your lunch!

225
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,256
Thank you very much.

226
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:09,190
Make sure you get some iron, I put lots of brown algae for you.

227
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,193
Hey Taka...

228
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,731
About that public relations work...

229
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,959
Unfortunately, I can't make it this afternoon.

230
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,867
So I was just thinking...

231
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,430
Can you send that rookie of yours as a representative?

232
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,608
Oh, that public relations work...

233
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,610
But sending him is a waste of time.

234
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,412
As a matter of fact, he's unreliable.

235
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,449
But there's nothing else I can do.

236
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:37,920
Damn!

237
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,351
All right then.

238
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,249
Can you go?

239
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,151
Me?

240
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,589
Well, it's an easy job, but...

241
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,966
But when you say public relations...

242
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,059
...I have to negotiate with others, right?

243
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,764
I don't have any experience with that. I can't do it.

244
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,837
It's like route sales.

245
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,600
It's so simple that anyone can do it.

246
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:04,612
Especially a young man like yourself.

247
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,942
Huh?

248
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,486
They said it's somewhere around here, but...

249
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:18,195
I only see regular houses.

250
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,591
I don't see any office buildings.

251
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,563
I see...

252
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:35,005
Is it just my imagination? I thought someone was watching me...

253
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,106
I have no time to think about such things.

254
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,151
I need to find that company fast and...

255
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,686
Hey! How long are you gonna make me wait?

256
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,255
What?

257
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:55,358
I see the person in charge is really young this time.

258
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,329
Now we can really negotiate.

259
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,838
Anyway, come on up.

260
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,703
My name is Fumiko.

261
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,475
You can see what I do from the work that's in front of you.

262
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:12,884
Yes...

263
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:18,514
Are you the person that I'm going to negotiate with?

264
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:19,921
Huh?

265
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:24,689
If you can, can you
just tell me the details?

266
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,495
They didn't tell you?

267
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,625
Great...

268
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,464
I hope you can understand.

269
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:39,408
My job is to write mangas all night and then sleep all day.

270
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,500
Get it?

271
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:45,979
But since you guys started to do some work in front of my place...

272
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,776
I can't sleep with all that noise.

273
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:50,922
I see...

274
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:55,422
So regarding this noise problem, your Nekoyanagi...

275
00:19:55,561 --> 00:20:00,294
...construction company and I decided to talk things over.

276
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,291
That's all.

277
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,429
They didn't tell you anything?

278
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:10,172
Your superiors are really mean.

279
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,209
Sorry.

280
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,839
That's just great.

281
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,312
But you'll do what you came here to do.

282
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,110
Start preparing for the meeting.

283
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,482
You're in charge of this right?

284
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,219
Let's begin the meeting.

285
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,417
Excuse me...

286
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:34,028
Basically, I want you to make me really tired so that I can fall asleep.

287
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,233
Well, it's just that, I...

288
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:42,669
Meeting is where a man's hips and the girl's ass goes bang bang.

289
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,537
They meet.

290
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,538
Well, they do meet, so that's why they call it meeting...

291
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,306
I see...

292
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,716
That's our agreement.

293
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:56,818
Since I can't fall asleep in the daytime due to your construction.

294
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,255
You people send over a strong man...

295
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:05,895
and make sure I can fall asleep after banging our hips and asses.

296
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,631
I see...

297
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,065
This is no time to be impressed...

298
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,828
Since you got it now, let's begin!

299
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,072
That's good...

300
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,212
Yeah...

301
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,310
Use your tongue more...

302
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,644
Lick the other hole as well.

303
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,622
Stick it deeper inside!

304
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,585
That feels good!

305
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,936
Okay, stick it inside.

306
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,106
Right here.

307
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,802
What? Are you sure?

308
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:54,976
Yeah.

309
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,811
If I get banged in this hole, I can fall asleep easily.

310
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,942
Now, don't hesitate. You're still young.

311
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:02,849
Yes.

312
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,285
Here I come.

313
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:12,787
It's tight...

314
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,707
Hey, that rookie seems to be doing well in his first meeting.

315
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,480
Yeah, he's got a nice tempo, too.

316
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,357
Yes! It feels good!

317
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:54,064
I like older guys, but I also enjoy the feeling you younger guys give.

318
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,549
It feels so good!

319
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,249
Go ahead.

320
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,088
Release it inside!

321
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,191
Women at Work

322
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,296
I finished the job.

323
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,588
Good job!

324
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:54,756
How did it go?

325
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,266
Take a shower and relax.

326
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,238
What a day.

327
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:06,841
Am I really lost in a parallel world?

328
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,580
Yeah, I must be.

329
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,720
Taka?
