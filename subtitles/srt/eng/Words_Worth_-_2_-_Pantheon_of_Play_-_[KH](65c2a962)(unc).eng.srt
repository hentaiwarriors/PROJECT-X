1
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:46,048
Fullscale attack!

2
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:54,423
The Tribe of Light is attacking us again!

3
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:56,196
Hurry! Hurry up!

4
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,780
<i>Your breasts are so soft....</i>

5
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:13,410
<i>This man....</i>

6
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,519
<i>You're pushing it in again!</i>

7
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:37,369
<i>Damn beast!
Sir Astral!</i>

8
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:42,479
<i>I have to run!
What are you doing, sir?</i>

9
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:44,047
Where is my ring?

10
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:46,617
<i>It's true.
What are you talking about?</i>

11
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:48,176
<i>It's true!</i>

12
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:57,295
<i>There's nobody in there!</i>

13
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:01,630
<i>Step aside,
or we'll report you to the Great King.</i>

14
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:06,432
What happened to that girl?

15
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,609
<i>We are searching for Sir Astral
following Sir Wartoshika's orders.</i>

16
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:13,474
Oops, this is bad!

17
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:15,814
<i>What horsepower he's got!</i>

18
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:20,112
<i>You're so desperate,
you must be hiding something in here!</i>

19
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:30,496
<i>Huh? lt's true.</i>

20
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:48,443
Go! Kill off the Tribe of Shadows
once and for all!

21
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:58,613
Die! You are all going to die!

22
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:02,853
What?

23
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:06,956
They came from the East Gate this time?

24
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:10,434
lt seems like a fullscale attack,
led by a giant machine.

25
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:15,571
Damn, the Tribe of Light
never learns its lesson!

26
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,176
Caesar and Sharon!
Yes, sir!

27
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:22,310
Gather the entire force!

28
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:25,647
We shall welcome them with full force!

29
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,913
Yes, sir!

30
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:36,124
l wonder why the Tribe of Light
is attacking us again so soon.

31
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,058
Could it be they have learned
the secret of the Words Worth Tablet?

32
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:46,468
Then l have to tell Astral the secret
of the Tablet as soon as possible!

33
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,374
Then l shall go look for Sir Astral myself.

34
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:52,377
Go!
Yes, sir!

35
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:02,417
<i>Stop it! What are you doing to me,
l'm a prisoner!</i>

36
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,419
Do we have to tell you?

37
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:09,690
<i>lt's unfair, Sir Stallion
is the only one enjoying the girls!</i>

38
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:11,663
Right, Brother?

39
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:16,632
<i>Yeah, you've got nice tits.
Don't! No!</i>

40
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,237
<i>Bro, this girl's crying.</i>

41
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:24,842
<i>She's crying with joy
because we're so good.</i>

42
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,880
How would l enjoy something this awful?

43
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:34,485
<i>She's dripping so much. Slut!</i>

44
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:47,162
Bro, do you think the Ladies of Light
have big pussies?

45
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,700
How would l know?

46
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:51,597
<i>How could that be? We're all the same!</i>

47
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:55,168
Then, Bro.
Yo!

48
00:04:58,178 --> 00:04:59,509
lt hurts!

49
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:12,423
<i>What're you doing?</i>

50
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:15,928
<i>We're going to check how big
you can take it in there.</i>

51
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:17,725
<i>No! Don't!</i>

52
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:21,298
<i>First, Sir Caesar's size.</i>

53
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:38,579
<i>Because you are attacking us,
we're too busy even to take a break.</i>

54
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:41,553
How could we get by
without a perk like this?

55
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,384
Right, Bro?
Yo.

56
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:46,956
You started the war.

57
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:49,359
You destroyed the Words Worth Tablet.

58
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:52,762
<i>We don't care for something
that happened so long ago.</i>

59
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:57,068
<i>We're just enjoying this moment!</i>

60
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:04,138
<i>Next, Sir Astral's size.</i>

61
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,718
<i>l'm melting!</i>

62
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:25,754
This girl knows how to use her tongue.

63
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:37,140
<i>Please, don't!</i>

64
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:42,009
<i>Sir Stallion's size. This will ruin her.</i>

65
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:45,777
<i>Before this makes her pussy too loose,
l'll use my own.</i>

66
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:48,286
Bro, let me have the first taste.
Yo!

67
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:52,152
<i>Don't come inside of her!
l'm going to use her, too!</i>

68
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:58,424
Thank you for the dinner!

69
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:14,074
Miss Maria.

70
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:17,015
Silverna, are you all right?

71
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:21,318
You saved me. Thank you.

72
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:29,019
l cannot forgive these men
of the Tribe of Shadows!

73
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:34,728
<i>I will never forgive that one man.</i>

74
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:40,104
Who could make you so angry?
Who is this unfortunate bastard?

75
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:41,640
Astral.

76
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,041
<i>That's what they called him.</i>

77
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:49,845
The next time l see him,
l will use my magic and turn him into dust.

78
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,578
<i>Oh, no! That's a little too much....</i>

79
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:54,647
Yes, l absolutely will!

80
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:00,653
Someone!

81
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:15,696
Miss Maria.

82
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:18,310
l will go and free the captured men.

83
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:20,744
<i>We'll attack them
from behind their defense line.</i>

84
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:24,910
lf you could report it to
Sir Fabris coming in from the East Gate.

85
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,079
l will.

86
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:35,256
There he comes. There he comes!

87
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:41,765
Here you go!

88
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:47,939
Help me!

89
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:06,489
l did it!

90
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:11,554
Sir Fabris!
That idiot! So conceited.

91
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,433
Here they come!

92
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:21,837
The most powerful swordsmen of
the Shadows, Sir Caesar and Miss Sharon!

93
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:34,048
Finally, my worthy opponents!

94
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,948
<i>l've been waiting for you!</i>

95
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:41,550
<i>Huh? There's nobody here.</i>

96
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:45,555
<i>Maybe they've all gone to
the Higher Levels?</i>

97
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:51,926
<i>l worked so hard to get the
Swordsman's Seal and now it's useless.</i>

98
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:58,103
<i>lf l have to climb all the way up,
l'll be exhausted before l get to the battle.</i>

99
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,769
Sir Astral.

100
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:04,646
<i>Hide? l see you're joining the battle, too.</i>

101
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:08,543
<i>Yes, after all, l'm a swordsman, too.</i>

102
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:12,689
<i>But l'm worried l might
just be a bother to everybody.</i>

103
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,727
<i>l don't think so.</i>

104
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:18,887
<i>Hide, you're quick and agile,
so you won't lose to the Tribe of Light.</i>

105
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:22,162
<i>Thank you. l'm just not confident.</i>

106
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:24,430
You just need to do your best.

107
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:30,108
<i>You're so right. Now that you've
talked to me, l feel more courageous.</i>

108
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:34,169
<i>What's wrong?
Just a little something....</i>

109
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:37,739
Hide, go ahead of me.
See you later.

110
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:46,725
<i>That was Nina, wasn't it?</i>

111
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:55,056
<i>That's Nina!</i>

112
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,861
Welcome, cute girl.

113
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:02,541
No! Leave me alone!

114
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:07,440
<i>Don't be ridiculous.
Why do you think l bothered to come out?</i>

115
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:10,580
Stay away!

116
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:12,850
No!

117
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:18,387
No, help me!

118
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:21,723
<i>How is it? You can't move, can you?</i>

119
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:29,728
Soon your body will be cold,
and there will be no pain, no suffering.

120
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:32,026
<i>l'm cold.</i>

121
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:44,006
So? Do you like it?

122
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,140
<i>l'm cold.</i>

123
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:49,821
When you can no longer feel cold or pain...

124
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,891
...l shall suck up all your energy and life.

125
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:57,093
Do you like it?

126
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:05,363
<i>l'm cold.</i>

127
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:08,662
Nina!

128
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:10,837
Sir Astral!

129
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,077
Nina, are you all right?

130
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:28,717
<i>Sir Astral, l'm cold.</i>

131
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:33,324
<i>Get a hold of yourself,
Nina, don't fall asleep!</i>

132
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:48,309
Oh, Sir Astral!

133
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:55,050
Good, you are awake now.

134
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:00,955
<i>Sir Astral, you're so warm.</i>

135
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:02,756
Nina.

136
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:08,456
Sir Astral, how long will this war go on?

137
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:15,500
Probably until either
the Tribe of Light or all of us die.

138
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:19,801
Why do we have to fight the Tribe of Light?

139
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:23,108
<i>l've seen many people
from the Tribe of Light.</i>

140
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:27,084
<i>They don't look all that bad.
l agree.</i>

141
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:33,119
We may be of different races,
but they must laugh and talk and cry...

142
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,660
...just like we do, l think.

143
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:41,594
Yes, the girls of the Tribe of Light
do smile and shed tears.

144
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:45,598
They have the same warm bodies
like you do.

145
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:47,670
Sir Astral.

146
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:51,773
How come you know
the girls of the Tribe of Light are warm?

147
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:55,043
<i>l'm sorry.</i>

148
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,648
Sir Astral, l feel something hard
against my tummy.

149
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:09,291
<i>That's my bad boy.
He woke up with your warmth.</i>

150
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:11,362
<i>l'm sorry, Nina.</i>

151
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,424
l love you, Sir Astral.

152
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:22,868
l know Miss Sharon lives in your heart.

153
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:25,600
<i>But l don't care.</i>

154
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:29,910
Even if you love Miss Sharon,
l still love you.

155
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,486
<i>Nina.
Please don't say anything, Sir Astral.</i>

156
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:39,557
Nina.
Sir Astral.

157
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:53,663
Sir Astral.

158
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:56,468
Nina.

159
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:05,875
Sir Astral.

160
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,998
<i>Sir Astral, l'm afraid.</i>

161
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:58,532
How can l take something this big
inside me?

162
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,504
<i>You don't need to worry. Here we go.</i>

163
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:04,032
Yes, okay.

164
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:07,941
lt hurts!

165
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:13,243
Sir Astral.

166
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:21,076
Sir Astral. lt feels so good.

167
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:32,795
Meow!

168
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,666
Where is Astral?

169
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:50,147
<i>l didn't find him in the castle.
Sir Wartoshika!</i>

170
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:52,013
Did you find him?

171
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:56,015
<i>Some have seen him earlier at
the swordfight training center, but....</i>

172
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:58,215
<i>Could it be he's obtained
a Swordsman's Seal?</i>

173
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,258
Could he be heading for the East Gate?

174
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:01,384
What?

175
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,523
l must tell Astral
where the Tablet fragments are hidden!

176
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:09,460
We must not let Astral die!

177
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:12,703
Bring back Astral right away! Go!

178
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:29,185
<i>Nina, why don't you take
a safe passage and go back?</i>

179
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:32,480
<i>You mustn't come
to dangerous places like this.</i>

180
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:38,793
Yes, but l thought this was
the only way to catch up with you.

181
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:42,699
Catch up with me?
Yes.

182
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:45,803
<i>l just couldn't help worrying about you.</i>

183
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:50,064
<i>But l'm not worried anymore.
l will be waiting for you.</i>

184
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:53,277
For ever and ever.

185
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,214
Caesar!

186
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:06,381
Damn you, Fabris!
Sharon!

187
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:12,219
<i>You seem like a strongwilled bitch!
You're worth raping!</i>

188
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:13,697
Here l come!

189
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,476
<i>Good! l like your determination!
You're stronger than Caesar.</i>

190
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:31,144
<i>But you're still no match for me!</i>

191
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:36,553
<i>Too bad, if you trained with me,
you'd be as strong as Pollux!</i>

192
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,821
Pollux? The Legendary Swordsman?

193
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,995
<i>The man was known as
the best swordsman of the Tribe of Light.</i>

194
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,189
<i>Pollux.</i>

195
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:49,567
Just about the time when
l became a worthy swordsman myself...

196
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,734
<i>...he disappeared.
And he became a legend.</i>

197
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:02,207
You look better without those.

198
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:07,614
Now l have to fuck you.
Bullshit!

199
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:11,286
Who would sleep with you?

200
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:14,319
Enough playing around.

201
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:25,234
Kill me!

202
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:30,303
<i>Huh! l can't kill you yet.
Then l shall kill myself.</i>

203
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:32,674
Then l dare you to kill yourself.

204
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:35,908
<i>You can't dare kill yourself
until you have killed me.</i>

205
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:40,073
l can see that in your eyes.

206
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:42,484
Sharon!

207
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:47,549
<i>Don't you find it entertaining to
fuck our brains out amidst this bloodbath?</i>

208
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:52,487
Kill me!

209
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:56,125
Only when l have
no more use for your body.

210
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,726
l shall torture you to death!

211
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:11,576
Damn kid!

212
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:22,420
Hide!

213
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:37,539
<i>lt's you, Hide?</i>

214
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:40,937
Sir Astral.

215
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:45,347
Who did this to you?
A man in silver armor.

216
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:50,851
<i>Guess l wasn't quite quick
and agile enough to evade his dagger.</i>

217
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:53,348
<i>Don't worry about me, Sir Astral.</i>

218
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:57,655
Please go help Sharon.

219
00:21:58,163 --> 00:22:02,793
What about Sharon?
Hold on to yourself, Hide!

220
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:10,106
<i>No, don't worry about me. l'm very sleepy.</i>

221
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:13,707
<i>No, Hide! You can't fall asleep here!</i>

222
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,111
Wake up! l said, wake up!

223
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:21,349
Sir Astral, take care.

224
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:24,513
Hide!

225
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:27,456
<i>Stop joking! You're kidding, right?</i>

226
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:31,560
Hey, wake up! Hide.

227
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:38,768
Hide!

228
00:22:58,257 --> 00:22:59,884
Where am l?

229
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:11,532
<i>How does a Shadow girl taste?
Don't!</i>

230
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:13,871
Maria?

231
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,342
Stop it already, Father, no, Sir Fabris.

232
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:30,421
<i>l shall avenge Hide!
Damn you! l'll kill you!</i>

233
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:32,846
Astral?

234
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:38,185
Sharon!

235
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,622
Astral, stay away!

236
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:46,296
<i>Pollux! You can't be?</i>

237
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:50,965
That man!

238
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,940
Pollux cannot be alive!

239
00:23:57,316 --> 00:24:00,251
Sharon, quick, take Caesar!

240
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:03,211
No, you have to come with us.

241
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,780
l have to kill this bastard.

242
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:11,888
<i>Okay, don't die, Astral.</i>

243
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:14,927
<i>l'll come back with
reinforcements right away.</i>

244
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:29,880
Father!

245
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:37,917
No!

246
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:46,388
You hurt not only me, but my father, too!

247
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:50,763
<i>l'll kill you! l'll turn you into dust!</i>

248
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:54,135
<i>Calm down, Maria!
You mustn't use that power!</i>

249
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:55,536
No!

250
00:24:55,607 --> 00:25:00,510
Even if the almighty God
may forgive him, l will not!

251
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:05,377
<i>l'll make sure he'll never appear
before me for ever and ever!</i>

252
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,214
But you said you liked it back then.

253
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:09,777
Shut up!

254
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:14,024
<i>That's what my body said
against my own will!</i>

255
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:16,083
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

256
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:22,694
<i>Do you think l enjoyed having
a Shadow man's nasty thing inside me?</i>

257
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:30,040
Now, you bastardturnedbeast!
You will be erased from this world!

258
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:33,173
Mystral Window!

259
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,910
Where am l?

260
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:15,077
Who am l?
