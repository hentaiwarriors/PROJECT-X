1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,752
Cut!

2
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,719
OK!

3
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,473
- Well done, everyone!
- Well done, everyone!

4
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,954
- Well done!
- Thank you.

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,994
- Well done.
- Well done!

6
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,636
Sex Beast

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,678
Idol of Darkness

8
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,110
lkumi, do you often cook at home?

9
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,314
Yes. But because I live alone,
I eat out a lot too.

10
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,195
But on your days off, there must be
a certain someone to cook for you?

11
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,070
That would be nice! But I'm so busy
with work at the moment.

12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,070
I'm picking you up at 6:30am tomorrow,
so don't sleep in!

13
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,550
I won't, Tanaka.
And make sure you're not late!

14
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,713
Good night.

15
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,758
Good night. Take care!

16
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,516
Graduation Day

17
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,353
lkumi.

18
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,518
- What the hell?
- Looks like the roof collapsed!

19
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,189
This shrine gives me the creeps.

20
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,196
Mm, let's get it over with quickly.

21
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,478
Right, ready for action!

22
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,957
Scene 36. Take 2. Action!

23
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,278
Good morning!

24
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,989
Sorry we're late.

25
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,192
I've kept you waiting.

26
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,114
Rie, this isn't good enough,
we've already started.

27
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,591
I'm so sorry.
But surely it's not time for me yet?

28
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,116
It's the supporting actress, isn't it?

29
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,550
Supporting actress?
She's the supporting actress more like!

30
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,995
She's a has-been. What a nerve!

31
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,354
Well then, shall we make a start?

32
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,437
- Don't pay any attention to her.
- I won't.

33
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,594
Right, get ready...action!

34
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,160
Ready for action! Scene 36. Take 2. Start!

35
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,028
No one's going to upstage me.

36
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,592
If it wasn't for that girl...

37
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,428
Cut!

38
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,788
OK!

39
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,477
- Rie, erm...where are you going?
- Leave me alone!

40
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,999
Are you the one
that woke me with your cry?

41
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,154
I will grant you your wish.

42
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,032
- Do you know what this is?
- Hm?

43
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,951
Well, well.

44
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,718
Drink, please.

45
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,072
Of course.

46
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,798
I'm so tired.

47
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,559
Sorry to keep you waiting.

48
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,191
Everyone's been waiting!

49
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,717
Going out to ten million fans nationwide,
lkumi Murase's Spring Concert!

50
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,075
Make sure you come! Promise!

51
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,912
5th March...

52
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,908
- Give me a massage.
- OK.

53
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,876
How's next week's schedule?

54
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,598
What's the matter?

55
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,592
Well...
You don't have any appointments.

56
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,033
Isn't it the manager's job
to find me work?!

57
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,993
I'm sorry.

58
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,317
That bitch!

59
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,790
Gets a little popular and look,
so full of herself!

60
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,756
She can't act, she's a terrible singer,
and she's not nearly as pretty as me!

61
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,799
The lead actress should really be me!

62
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,758
She's the one they want now.

63
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,310
If only I could summon up the sex beast.

64
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,751
You are my faithful servant.

65
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,236
- Do you listen to everything I say?
-Yes.

66
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,788
There! Yes, there!

67
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,715
More, more!

68
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,076
That's so good!

69
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,119
I'm coming!

70
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,591
That girl's not been herself lately.

71
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,597
Well, boss, the truth is...

72
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,709
She's at a critical stage.

73
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,268
A scandal could ruin her.

74
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,149
- Will you have a word?
- Yes, boss.

75
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,551
Graduation Ceremony

76
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,919
Akira!

77
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,991
Can I have a moment?

78
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,433
I want you to
stop seeing lkumi for a while.

79
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,873
Why?!

80
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,669
She's at a very critical stage.

81
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,956
She's young and inexperienced.

82
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,392
From now on, she'll be working on
many projects and she must succeed.

83
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,279
Until then, love and romance
are out of the question.

84
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,389
You two had a bad argument
the other day, didn't you?

85
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,151
It's because she's so busy
you can't see each other, isn't it?

86
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,472
At the moment,
she's worrying about you.

87
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,395
She's in no fit state to work properly,
and that's a problem.

88
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,879
It'll soon be time
for her debut concert tour.

89
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,311
She must be a success,
for the sake of her future.

90
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,839
Just think about her.

91
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,191
I want you to disappear
from lkumi's life, now.

92
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,753
Akira!

93
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,432
lkumi.

94
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,873
No matter how long you wait,
Akira won't come.

95
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,712
What?!

96
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,360
lkumi, listen to me carefully.

97
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,309
You're at a critical stage. Love and...

98
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,755
I know that!

99
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,754
But...

100
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,630
Akira understands.

101
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,550
He'll disappear from your life,

102
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,631
he's promised.

103
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,674
Shit!

104
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,998
Oi, come here!

105
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,199
- You won't put up a fight, huh?
- Not a bit.

106
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,077
This is an lkumi song.

107
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,717
I hate this girl!
Pretending to be so innocent!

108
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,674
I find her so cute -
her and her big breasts.

109
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,675
Oh, my darling lkumi! Suck my dick!

110
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,311
She looked great in that bikini
in a recent magazine.

111
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,188
Yeah, she has that real innocent look
but with seductive eyes.

112
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,434
I'm dying to fuck her!

113
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,112
Wait!

114
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,118
You fucker!

115
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,958
What is this?

116
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,993
Hello!

117
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:03,714
Hello, this is Akira Kobayashi.
Please leave a message after the tone.

118
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,996
Don't scare me!

119
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,912
You go first.

120
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,714
Rie!

121
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,318
There it is!

122
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,156
(Voodoo chant)

123
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,629
Just as I was told!

124
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,710
Yabe, let's begin.

125
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,636
(Voodoo chant)

126
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,039
Boss!

127
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,030
lkumi has....

128
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,236
Ikumi has disappeared!

129
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,033
What did you say?!

130
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,640
(Voodoo chant)

131
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,315
lkumi Murase
Spring Concert

132
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,511
(Voodoo chant)

133
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,033
Yes, I've tried her friend's apartment.

134
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,709
I'll definitely find her.

135
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,109
Finally, the time has come
to wake the sex beast.

136
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,396
It's so good!

137
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,549
I'm coming! I'm coming!

138
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,755
I'm coming!

139
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,312
Sorry to keep you.

140
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,958
Thank you.

141
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,791
- Akira...
- I...

142
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,955
I...have been thinking about
what Mr Tanaka told me,

143
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,310
thinking about us.

144
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,312
Even when you become a star,
you are you.

145
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,551
And I am me. That's how it is.

146
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,877
As you get more and more popular,
you're going to slip away from me.

147
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,475
That's how I felt.

148
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,193
But even if you become famous,
you'll still be lkumi.

149
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,998
The lkumi the star on the TV

150
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,719
and the lkumi with me now.

151
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,510
I know that both lkumis
are precious to me.

152
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,592
Ikumi, you told me once

153
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:18,509
''I've got a dream where I'm a singer,
performing in front of loads of fans.''

154
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,672
So...sing for me.

155
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,070
I love lkumi the singer too.

156
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,589
Akira!

157
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,033
lkumi.

158
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,196
Your fans are waiting.

159
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,555
Ikumi!

160
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,398
I'll be watching the TV, cheering for you.

161
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,950
Sing one for me, lkumi the star.

162
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,991
Give it your best!

163
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,034
Give it your best, lkumi.

164
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,800
He told me where you were.

165
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,997
- He's a good guy.
- I know.

166
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,399
Let's go!

167
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,637
Good evening, everyone!

168
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:35,719
I'm so happy that so many of you
have come here to see me tonight!

169
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,613
Encore! Encore!

170
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,491
Encore! Encore! Encore!

171
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,895
lkumi!

172
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,449
Thank you for tonight, everybody!

173
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,809
You all made it a great concert!
I've really enjoyed it!

174
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,778
There's something I want to tell you.

175
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,738
There is at the moment...

176
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,697
there's someone I really like.

177
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,533
That girl!

178
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,859
Boss, let her be.

179
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,373
But...

180
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,331
She is doing fine.

181
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,217
Get lkumi!

182
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:16,131
This boy that I like,
he's in my year at high school.

183
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,375
I met this boy
when we started high school.

184
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,372
And I've liked him ever since.

185
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:32,459
He hurt himself saving me
during summer camp.

186
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,658
We went to the school festival
in fancy dress together.

187
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,892
We ran the three-legged race together
on sports day.

188
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,215
He's always by my side,

189
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,212
he looks after me.

190
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,488
He's no movie star
and he's a bit of a dope.

191
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:59,212
But to me, he's the most
important person in the world.

192
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,173
I'm so busy working,

193
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,694
I can't see him as often as I'd like.

194
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,453
So sometimes we argue.

195
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,730
But...after that last time that I saw him

196
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,575
I've decided not to worry about
these stupid things.

197
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,216
I've decided to trust him.

198
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,093
Whatever happens,
I'll be right beside him.

199
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,731
And...

200
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,817
Well, I don't know what I'm saying.

201
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,089
I've been too shy
to say anything until now.

202
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,697
I...

203
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:55,537
I'm in love with Akira.

204
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,855
- Go for it!
- Good luck!

205
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,532
Thank you.

206
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:51,175
I am blessed to have so many fans
out there who support me.

207
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,578
I'm so happy!

208
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,458
I - KU - MI! Go for it!

209
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,417
Thank you, everyone!

210
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,453
I will sing a song for all my fans
who have supported me

211
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,294
and for my boyfriend
who is watching at home.

212
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:43,297
In the hazy sunshine in my bedroom

213
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,334
I can almost see your smiling face

214
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:57,416
That white T-shirt you always wear

215
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,009
It's shining so bright
Are you sad?

216
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:11,570
That summer's day when we first met

217
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,255
And now

218
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,979
In my heart

219
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,856
I'll hold you again

220
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,330
And kiss you with passion

221
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:33,337
Don't you forget about me

222
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,856
I want you to feel my heart beat

223
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,455
I want to send my heart

224
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,692
Carried on the wind, softly

225
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,294
To you

226
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,655
lkumi!

227
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,734
lkumi!

228
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,852
There they are.

229
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,255
Am I out of gas?

230
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,339
Shit!

231
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,379
lkumi!

232
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,573
lkumi.

233
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,052
Ikumi!

234
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,834
Give her back to me.

235
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,018
Akira!

236
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,215
You died for me.

237
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,448
Akira!

238
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,173
lkumi.

239
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,218
Where did you get that strength from?

240
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,015
I don't even know myself.

241
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,853
When I think about you,
I'm filled with a strange power.

242
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,859
Oh, Akira!

243
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,216
It's so...

244
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,020
Oh...there!

245
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,976
I'll be gentle.

246
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,453
Slowly.

247
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,616
It feels good, lkumi.

248
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,691
Me too.

249
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,932
Ikumi.

250
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,051
Akira!

251
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,091
I'm coming!

252
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:44,132
In the hazy sunshine in my bedroom

253
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:52,492
I can almost see your smiling face

254
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:58,052
That white T-shirt you always wear

255
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:05,291
It's shining so bright
Are you sad?

256
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:12,489
That summer's day when we first met

257
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,538
And now

258
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,739
In my heart

259
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,736
I'll hold you again

260
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,449
And kiss you with passion

261
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:34,252
Don't you forget about me

262
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,696
I want you to feel my heart beat

263
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,489
I want to send my heart

264
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,573
Carried on the wind, softly

265
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,458
To you

266
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,536
I'll hold you again

267
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:25,249
And kiss you with passion

268
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:32,052
Don't you forget about me

269
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,496
I want you to feel my heart beat

270
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,289
I want to send my heart

271
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,373
Carried on the wind, softly

272
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,690
To you

273
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,738
The end
