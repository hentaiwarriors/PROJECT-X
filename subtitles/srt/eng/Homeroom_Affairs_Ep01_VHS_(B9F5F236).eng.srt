1
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,317
So, when can I see you again?

2
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:23,189
Well... still, school starts today and all...

3
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,759
So skip it - skip school today.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,944
No good...

5
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,381
After all, I'm such a serious high school student.

6
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,758
HOMEROOM
AFFAIRS

7
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:55,588
<i>An 18 year old high school senior's affair with her homeroom teacher.</i>

8
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,459
PART ONE: Hitting me will cost you dearly, teach!

9
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,373
Mr. Ehara... the truth is, for the longest time...

10
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,808
...I've been in love with you!

11
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,377
Kya! I'm so ashamed!

12
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:28,120
How sweet, these girls... they haven't lost their innocence...

13
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:28,888
Teacher!

14
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,824
Well, I've been in love with you, too!

15
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,894
So have I!

16
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:35,895
Me, too!

17
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:36,762
And me!

18
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,699
Teacher!

19
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,077
Just a dream...

20
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,954
Morning, Tokiro!

21
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,491
Oh! Good morning, super!

22
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,627
Today's the day, isn't it?

23
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:13,931
Right! The first day of my teaching life.

24
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,235
That's true, yes.

25
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,572
But the school you've been assigned to is a girl's high school, right?

26
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,849
Uh, yeah.

27
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:26,279
To hear the high school girls around here talk of it, the place is fantastic!

28
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,782
Makes me wish I were ten years younger.

29
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,251
Cut the jokes!

30
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,754
The school I've been assigned to, Mitsuba Girls High School,

31
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,489
isn't that kind of place!

32
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,391
Besides, I'm a teacher!

33
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,927
To even think such slovenly thought about my students is...

34
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,804
Forbidden!

35
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:04,050
Sheesh, that super... oh!

36
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,053
<i>What an incredibly beautiful high school student!</i>

37
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:11,424
<i>Now, that type of innocence...</i>

38
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:15,061
<i>Yes, you can say it takes all kinds,</i>

39
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:19,432
<i>but that pure, unspoiled form is the true appearance of a high school student.</i>

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,735
Mitsuba, Mitsuba station!

41
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,507
Getting off! I'm getting off!

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,580
Sorry!

43
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,050
No, it's my fault, I wasn't paying attention.

44
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,460
This... this small box is...

45
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,562
CONDOM!?

46
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,434
Oh my, come over here, sir.

47
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,840
You're still a high school student, for crying out loud! Why do you have...

48
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,177
I could hear you without your shouting!

49
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,246
How embarrassing! Use your common sense!

50
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:09,982
Anyway, besides that...

51
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:20,927
Well, mister, what do you think?

52
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,901
You, sir, are just my type.

53
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,838
Next time, let's go on a date.

54
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:40,546
See you later, my handsome prince.

55
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,923
That was a night mare, that was...

56
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,793
"See you later, my handsome prince."

57
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,395
Yeah, right. There's no reason to expect.

58
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,987
That... that girl...

59
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,623
Oh my God...

60
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,093
Miyako, what's wrong?

61
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,496
Nothing, nothing at all... Heh heh heh...

62
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:35,401
Oh no... he's one of the new teachers...

63
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,539
Somehow I've gotta make sure we never meet.

64
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,447
Hey, Miyako... Miyako!! You're been acting kind of weird today.

65
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,641
It... it's nothing.

66
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:53,719
Don't tell me you know our new teacher?

67
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:54,812
That's impossible.

68
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,690
Yeah, you're right. There's no reason to believe...

69
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:01,360
that a serious girl like you would have any relation with a guy.

70
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,361
Yeah...

71
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,635
Miyako Hase, huh... Well.

72
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,739
since I'm your homeroom teacher, there's no way I'm letting you out of my sight.

73
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,690
There's no help for you taking such an attitude!

74
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,159
I'm contacting your parents!

75
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,329
Oh, cut the shit, will you!

76
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,632
Sit still for one second and they walk all over you.

77
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,936
Who do you think you're talking to addressing your homeroom teacher in such a fashion!

78
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,614
I would never have believed that at a top school...

79
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,674
like Mitsuba such a student like you...

80
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,019
I wonder what would happen if I yelled out now while dressed like this?

81
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:02,989
You're not...!

82
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,761
Uh-huh, everyone who saw me like this would think the same thing.

83
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,854
<i>Teacher, Mr. Ehara had his way with me over my protests...</i>

84
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,656
A CURRENT AFFAIR - ARE OUR SCHOOLS SEX PALACES!? HOMEROOM TEACHER RAPES STUDENT!

85
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,716
AN ACT UNBE COMING OF AN EDUCATOR! "I'LL NEVER BELIEVE ANOTHER TEACHER AGAIN!"

86
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:35,555
A naked girl in a classroom - the evidence is gathered before you...

87
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,707
What kind of preposterous...!

88
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,692
An any rate, put some clothes on!

89
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,327
Oh, teacher.

90
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,771
Let's be more tactful, hm?

91
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,475
If possible, I'd like to avoid any trouble.

92
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:02,481
If we both keep quiet, then things will be totally peaceful, right, teach?

93
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,489
Next time, come to my house so I can thank you properly.

94
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,963
Good-bye, teacher!

95
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,713
God, that was scary...

96
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:39,819
It's a test.

97
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:45,816
This is a test sent from above to see if I'm fit to be a teacher.

98
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,795
I will definitely bring that girl around.

99
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,980
This is it.

100
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,289
Ah, Mr. Ehara!

101
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:21,269
You came for a roll already? Impulsive, aren't you?

102
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:26,148
This is a home visit! I'd like to meet your parents.

103
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,654
Hm... Well, then, please, come in.

104
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,038
C'mon, get a grip!

105
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,585
Pardon the intrusion.

106
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,179
Your family lives in one room?

107
00:09:56,305 --> 00:10:00,967
Sorry, my parents are divorced. Please sit down.

108
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,171
Here.

109
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,649
In that case...

110
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,823
You don't have to be so formal, you know...

111
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,619
Really? Then I guess I'll be goin...

112
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:25,708
Now, you came all this way, so why not enjoy yourself? Besides, it's safe here.

113
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,298
Whoa! Will you cut it out, you idiot!

114
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,637
Stop it...

115
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,892
C'mon, you get undressed too, teach.

116
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,981
Hurry up!

117
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,162
Kyaa! T... Teacher!

118
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,233
What are you doing?

119
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,544
Be a little more gentle!

120
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,606
This is silk, you know! You're terrible!

121
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,950
Alleee!!!

122
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:03,014
What in the world...

123
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,092
That's right, yesterday...

124
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,663
<i>I came over to her house intending to have a parent conference,</i>

125
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:14,650
<i>and was tempted by her. After that...</i>

126
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,303
<i>I don't remember!</i>

127
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,989
<i>But... I've still got on my shorts...</i>

128
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,444
Still, like this...

129
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,044
Huh?

130
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:38,090
Whassup? It's too early t'be so loud.

131
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,642
At any rate, I'll be going now. We'll meet another time.

132
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,895
Are you right?

133
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,189
Just... a little woozy...

134
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,691
You should rest a little, you know?

135
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,902
Last night you lost an awful lot of blood...

136
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,070
Huh?

137
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,450
Mr. Ehara, you saw me naked and the blood came gushing out of your nose.

138
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,828
You blacked out, I was so surprised.

139
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:13,793
So... we... we didn't cross the student-teacher line?

140
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:18,256
Teacher, don't tell me you're a virgin?

141
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,594
You're kidding! At your age!? Embarrassing!

142
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,680
Leave me alone!

143
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,357
You'll be fine after some breakfast I'll make some now.

144
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,292
You made all this?

145
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,770
What do you expect? There's no one else here, after all.

146
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,843
You've got to eat a good breakfast.

147
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,714
It's a good start to the day.

148
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:12,101
An appetite for food and an appetite for sex are the foundations of good health.

149
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,220
Quit while you're ahead!

150
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,781
You could stay longer, you know.

151
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,702
There's time before school starts.

152
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,404
That's not possible.

153
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,372
If I relax at a student's house,

154
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,458
how can I distinguish myself as a teacher?

155
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,548
Mr. Ehara!

156
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,894
Next time let's get nasty, okay?

157
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,075
Tokiro!

158
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,577
These days you look as if you're going to die.

159
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,665
Yeah, going to work these days has got me depressed.

160
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:21,087
That's no good. It's only been a month and you're sighing.

161
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:25,725
I'd think you'd better be laughing heartily, surrounded by young girls.

162
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,262
Well... There's more to it than that.

163
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:46,112
Now then, in the case of past perfect, we... uh!?

164
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,743
Teacher, is something wrong?

165
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,246
Er... No, nothing...

166
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,042
Why, that...

167
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:06,432
Now then, read the answer to Example 3, Miss Hase.

168
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:07,717
Yes, sir:

169
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:17,043
"The concert will have started when I arrived at the hall"

170
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,478
Um... Very good, Miss Hase.

171
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,394
<i>Flawless reports...</i>

172
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,898
<i>And good at sports, yet...</i>

173
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:45,588
<i>If only her personality were good, there wouldn't be a problem.</i>

174
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,048
OW!!!

175
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,633
Sorry!

176
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:19,705
It shouldn't be like this.

177
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:25,378
I'm supposed to be send students along the straight-and-narrow.

178
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:35,454
An admirable high school girl should have such a pretty face.

179
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,056
What are you doing?

180
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:49,569
Miss Hase, how about quitting trying to give me a heart attack, okay?

181
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:52,488
If you don't cut it out, I'm really going to get angry!

182
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,747
You've forgotten already about that night?

183
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,583
Stop it!

184
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,918
If someone were to hear you!?

185
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:08,087
It would be a problem.

186
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,380
Damn right, it would.

187
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,426
Teacher, kiss me!

188
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:14,468
What?

189
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,723
If you kiss me here and now I'll be good from now on.

190
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,308
But here? In a place like this?

191
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:25,730
I see... 'bye!

192
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,448
All right!

193
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:06,062
<i>She's so cute.</i>

194
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:16,155
<i>No, if she's lying, that's it! I can't work from feeling!</i>

195
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:20,993
<i>In order to escape from this day-to-day-hell,</i>

196
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:24,397
<i>I'll have to do what she says...</i>

197
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,015
Gotcha!

198
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:47,019
Bye, teach! We'll play some more tomorrow, 'kay?

199
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:10,084
That's it, that's the limit!

200
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,880
I have nothing to be ashamed of!

201
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:16,883
Now I'll have to talk severefly to her!

202
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,323
This time I won't give in!

203
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,594
You're late.

204
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:37,653
She's at it again!

205
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:44,043
Hase!

206
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,915
Huh? Oh, Christ, what do you want?

207
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:58,382
Why do you have to go from one unrepentant act to the next?

208
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,551
Papa, no!

209
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:04,964
Teacher!

210
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,522
Mr. Ehara, great, he's coming around?

211
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,444
For a second there I didn't know what to think.

212
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,987
Ow!

213
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:22,156
I am so sorry.

214
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,077
Let me introduce you, this is my father.

215
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,372
Pleased to meet you. Thank you for looking after my daughter.

216
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,791
Father!?

217
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:35,294
Forgive me. I had no idea you were her homeroom teacher.

218
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:40,758
Still, to hit her so suddenly, I thought one of her jealous...

219
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,177
No, it's not like that!

220
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,221
Ah, you're embarrassed.

221
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:50,142
Nothing to be embarrassed about. Even I as her father...

222
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:53,271
can see she's the kind of pretty girl you'd like to take down and bed...

223
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,189
Papa, please.

224
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,315
Ah, that's right.

225
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,735
Before I forget, here's this month's living expenses.

226
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:00,862
Thanks, papa!

227
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:05,575
Paying at the bank is faster, but then we'd hardly ever meet.

228
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:09,537
What can you do? After all, papa, you're a busy man.

229
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:24,343
By, Miyako, don't get into any trouble!

230
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:27,513
You too, papa. Take care of yourself, okay?

231
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:31,951
Oh, teacher!

232
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,523
I'm going to make you pay dearly for hitting me.

233
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:55,082
I see... It's about Miyako's behavior.

234
00:22:55,834 --> 00:23:00,713
Yes. I figured that her home life must be different, still...

235
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:05,426
I wish that she would hear it from you as well as from me.

236
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:09,305
There's a lot that I'm worried about too. Fine!

237
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,725
Next time, I'll definitely have a word with her.

238
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,311
"Always make sure you use the right contraceptive!"

239
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,396
That's not what I meant!

240
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,315
Now, now...

241
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:23,236
What's with this sipping? Down that sucker in one gulp!

242
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:24,695
Down it!

243
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:29,242
There's a lad!

244
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:32,278
Hey, Pops, one more, and make it hot!

245
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:42,421
Many things have happened in our family...

246
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:46,968
I've always tried to make Miyako happy, even when she was a kid.

247
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:56,969
You might see her as a hell-raiser, but she really is a good kid.

248
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,897
It's just that people tend to see things in black and white.

249
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,066
That's why she's readily misunderstood.

250
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:06,279
That's why, if something should ever happen to cause her pain...

251
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:11,033
I'd want you and you alone to be by her side, please!

252
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,453
Leave it t'me!

253
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,124
I'll take responsibility for Miz Hase!

254
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:21,460
Ask anythin' you'd like! Anytime!

255
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:33,222
Really? Would you mind terribly putting that in writing?

256
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:42,415
"I, Tokiro Ehara, hereby pledge that, as Miyako Hase's homeroom teacher,

257
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:48,788
I will look for her should the need arise..." Huh?

258
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:51,157
You want my signature, too?

259
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:53,743
Whoa, Mr. Ehara!

260
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:54,927
Hey, are you all right?

261
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:57,788
Don't go to sleep here, teacher.

262
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:06,372
Teacher? Teacher!

263
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,520
Time to get up, teach! Your breakfast is getting cold!

264
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,940
Huh? What's Hase doing here?

265
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,733
Sheesh, what a sleepyhead!

266
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:31,948
What's this?

267
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,867
Heh heh heh... Well, the main course.

268
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,808
Is li'l-ol'-me!

269
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,260
Just a dream...

270
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,653
Oh, teacher!

271
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,850
Shall I pour you some coffee?

272
00:25:58,934 --> 00:25:59,976
Or...

273
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:02,937
Do you want some milk?

274
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:10,770
Hah hah hah! I like you, teach, you're so funny!

275
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:15,241
It... It's a dream! I still haven't woken up from this nightmare!

276
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:18,077
That's right. If this is a dream...

277
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,916
What was that for?

278
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:27,186
Payback for treating an adult like a fool!

279
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:31,457
Serves you right. Huh?

280
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:34,794
Huh? That hurt!

281
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,196
This is reality?

282
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:38,931
Damn right, it is!

283
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,934
How did you get in here?

284
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:46,022
I told the super I was your younger sister. See?

285
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:51,277
So, what do you want on a Sunday morning?

286
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:54,405
I just moved in.

287
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,324
Just moved in? That's nice...

288
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:58,618
What!? You just moved in!?

289
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:03,623
So, I'll be staying here for a while, all right?

290
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:10,838
I'm moving in. It's settled.

291
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,499
Settled by whom!?

292
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:17,136
Are you crazy, just blurting out suddenly you're...

293
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:19,388
I didn't say I was living here for free.

294
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,140
I'll pay the rent in advance...

295
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:23,142
Again with the...!

296
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:29,106
with my body.

297
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:32,985
Hey, cut it out!

298
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,824
I'll even throw in a lot of extra service.

299
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,616
No, it's no good!

300
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:05,318
What's the matter with you?

301
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:10,064
Get serious! A teacher and a student living under the same roof?

302
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:12,316
If anyone found out...

303
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:17,363
I'd definitely be fired.

304
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:19,232
If that ever happened...

305
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:26,497
My family back in the country...

306
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:29,250
Figures, you're just like the rest, teacher.

307
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:35,047
You use kind words but only think about yourself.

308
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:38,050
You don't want to get involved in any trouble.

309
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,086
You're the same as all the rest.

310
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:41,420
Miss Hase...

311
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:43,055
If that's so... If that's so...

312
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:46,893
you should stop messing in other people's business,

313
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:49,645
coming out the way you did for a conference!

314
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,480
I hate your guts, teacher!

315
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:52,532
Wait!

316
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:04,660
This... This is definitely what I wrote.

317
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,348
But what in the world happened?

318
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:16,255
I'm always going to have her around like this!

319
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:38,444
<i>I hate your guts, teacher!</i>

320
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:06,430
She didn't come back here?

321
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:09,350
Hey, come to see the apartment?

322
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:10,643
Huh? Apartment?

323
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:13,521
Yep, pretty young girl lived there.

324
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:16,941
Somehow her father's company went belly-up...

325
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,068
She left early this morning.

326
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:28,494
<i>"I'd want you, and you alone, to be by her side, please!"</i>

327
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:33,099
<i>You don't think he knew everything then...</i>

328
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:36,961
<i>and was leaving his daughter in my care!</i>

329
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:39,463
Hey!

330
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:53,186
<i>I'll be staying for a while, all right?</i>

331
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:57,523
That idiot! She really didn't have anywhere else to go!

332
00:30:57,624 --> 00:30:59,926
So she came to my place with that paper...

333
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:03,863
I wrote while I was half-drunk, asking for help! And what do I do!?

334
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:31,766
Hase!

335
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,566
Welcome!

336
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:19,313
Stop it, here, all alone...

337
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:21,858
Well, we can't get down and dirty here...

338
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:27,071
It'd be just like her... with no place to stay.

339
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,156
She'd probably call to one of these guys and...

340
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,333
<i>I... I don't have anywhere to stay...</i>

341
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:42,086
<i>If I could stay just for one night...</i>

342
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:44,338
<i>And then...</i>

343
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:44,590
Ah! This is all my fault!

344
00:33:44,658 --> 00:33:46,692
If I'd only been a little more...

345
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,255
That's right! Her stuff is still at the apartment!

346
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,382
Maybe she'll come back for it!

347
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:21,894
Hase!

348
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:30,436
She's not here...

349
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:51,424
God. I was rash...

350
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:56,028
If I'd known about her condition. I never would've done it!

351
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,273
<i>"You should stop messing in other people's business,</i>

352
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:17,176
<i>coming out the way you did!"</i>

353
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,347
MIYAKO!!!

354
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,585
Oh, teacher?

355
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,839
I must've fallen asleep...

356
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:58,509
Have you been in there all this time!?

357
00:36:58,594 --> 00:37:00,970
I mean, after all, up and leaving's all well and good.

358
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,597
But I had nowhere else to go.

359
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:06,225
And when I came back you were gone.

360
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:11,105
I thought I'd scare you so I hid in here.

361
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,732
Why, you...

362
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:16,903
Aah, it's night already!

363
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:39,467
Come on, let's sort out your things.

364
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:44,180
Man, this room's going to be a lot smaller from here on in...

365
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:46,933
Teacher...

366
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:52,021
Well, there's no help for it, is there? The situation being what it is...

367
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:01,614
Hey...

368
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,452
If you'd insisted that it wouldn't work I was going to blackmail you...

369
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:10,039
with living in my school club's meeting room on assembly day!

370
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:15,795
I told you the price for hitting me would be high.

371
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,344
<i>"High" is right... and there's still interest due...</i>

372
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:41,279
Sheesh, what a day this has been...

373
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,822
Teacher!

374
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:47,076
I'll scrub your back for you.

375
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:50,246
Just my way of thanking you for coming back.

376
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:52,915
Idiot! Don't come near me!

377
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:55,902
Tah-daah!

378
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:02,341
How do you like my swimsuit?

379
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:04,969
Whew...

380
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:06,846
Hoping I'd come in naked?

381
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,264
Don't talk stupid!

382
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:11,267
Now get out of here!

383
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,312
What's wrong? It's okay every now and then, isn't ti?

384
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:18,983
A change of pace is interesting.

385
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:24,572
Doing it like this feels good, doesn't it?

386
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:27,700
Hey now, stop it!

387
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:29,827
And now, the bubble dance!

388
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,246
Yi... Cut it out!

389
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:35,174
Mmm... Just like at a soap palace...

390
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:39,245
She... She's so soft...

391
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,427
I'll wash all the places that feel good!

392
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:58,147
Well? Not bad, hmmm?

393
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:02,610
So... this is what a soap palace is like...

394
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:15,456
That's right, you're still a virgin, aren't you, teach?

395
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:21,521
All right, then I'm gonna pop your cherry!

396
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,423
Idiot! Cut it out!

397
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,634
My, they are close for a brother and sister.
