1
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,890
We'll be on our way then!

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,960
Have a safe trip. Cheer them all on for all of us too.

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,530
Okay.

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,460
Hold it right there!

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,370
Chika-bu!

6
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,710
I'm going too!

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,620
It'd be terrible if I don't go to Minami's big game!

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,060
You have no idea what kind of terrible things could happen if I don't...

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,130
Mio-chan...
You have no idea what kind of terrible things could happen if I don't...

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,360
You have no idea what kind of terrible things could happen if I don't...

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,750
Hey, you do remember that you promised to stay home today so you wouldn't disrupt the game, don't you?

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,610
Don't be like that, Kosuke...

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,310
If you do that crazy thing you just said, I'll tell Keigo-san...

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,380
Ah! Ok, ok! Don't tell my dad! I'll do as I said and stay here.

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,450
Alright, then, I won't tell Keigo-san.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,030
Thank you!

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,620
I love you, Kosuke!

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,740
Hey, hey...

19
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,550
Honestly, if Keigo-san were to come back, it would mean a lot to Mio.

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,490
Keigo-san said that he was going to be coming back with the former manager.

21
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,860
He said he had something really important to say to onii-chan...

22
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,520
I wonder what it's about...

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,450
What if it's about onii-chan not being able to stay here...?

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,410
No, this isn't just about onii-chan...

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,125
If things don't go well for Kaoru-san... If her exam goes badly,

26
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,023
she might have to go back to Kagoshima.

27
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,470
It's the same with Minami-chan...

28
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,820
If she were to get into a school far away,

29
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,920
I wouldn't be able to see her every day like I do now.

30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,555
Listy is staying with us in Sazanami for as long as she takes to heal.

31
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:42,887
That's what Mayu-onee-chan said.

32
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,780
So that means someday, I'll have to say goodbye to them.

33
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,084
Mayu-onee-chan, Kaede-chan, Yuuhi-chan, Hayu-onee-chan...

34
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:55,489
We can't stay together forever.

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,920
Mayuki-san!

36
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,930
Ever since I was a child, I hated winter. The blowing snow and the cold winds, I hate it all.

37
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,250
I hate winter. Because it tells me that I'll have to say goodbye to loved ones soon...

38
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,910
Triangle Heart

39
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,580
Sazanami Girl's DormSazanami Girl's Dorm
Triangle Heart

40
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,240
Part 2 ~ Winter's Pledge ~
Triangle Heart

41
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,890
Yuu-chan!

42
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,310
Time's running out!

43
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,700
Minami-chan... You can do it!

44
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,830
Ima-chan!

45
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,730
Minami-chan!

46
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,480
Minami-chan!

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,160
Minami-chan!

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,070
Minami-chan!

49
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,980
Bring it on, Okamoto!

50
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,410
53 to 54! B-Team wins!

51
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,010
Minami-chan!

52
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,730
We finally did it! We won! We beat Rikako-san and her gang!

53
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,680
Minami-chan?

54
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,460
I wonder what's wrong? I really wanted to win against Rikako-san, but now...

55
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,260
Okamoto.

56
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,310
Rikako-san...

57
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,340
That was a great shot! You've gotten pretty good.

58
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,300
No, not at all... I'm still just a beginner...

59
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,880
Hey, hey... It's not good for the new team captain to talk that way...

60
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,730
Don't give me 'huh'! You were chosen by unanimous vote.

61
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,270
We can't have you sniveling.

62
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,760
Y-You can't! There really are better people than me, so...

63
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,346
Okamoto! I have full confidence in you. You can trust my judgment.

64
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:39,059
I'm leaving the basketball team to you!

65
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,120
Rikako-san...

66
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,680
Now I can finally retire from the club with a clear conscience.

67
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,860
What's wrong, Okamoto?

68
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,690
Rikako-san!

69
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,390
Woah, now, you really are sensitive. You're starting to get me worried.

70
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,600
But... But...

71
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,450
Ok, I get it, you can stop crying.

72
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,960
Rikako-san!

73
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,600
Congratulations, Minami-chan!

74
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,890
You seem really emotional, Chika.

75
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,680
I just hate sad things.

76
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,250
How about you, Listy?

77
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,580
Huh? I don't know about like or dislike, but I do know I don't like sadness.

78
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,980
Yeah, that's true.

79
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,130
I really love it at Sazanami.

80
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,698
Everyone there is really kind.

81
00:05:51,065 --> 00:05:56,371
If I could have my way, I would stay with them forever...

82
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,080
But, it just isn't possible, is it?

83
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,720
Someday everyone will have to leave.

84
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,370
I think everything changes over time little-by-little, but that doesn't mean it's bad...

85
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,920
Don't you think?

86
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,890
No, it's just as you said, Listy... But still... Still...

87
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,580
Tears don't suit you, you know. I prefer it when you're smiling.

88
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,500
I don't want to be separated from everyone!

89
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,360
Chika...

90
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,250
I want everything to stay just like this...

91
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,850
Ooh! Looks like it's started to snow, Keigo-san.

92
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,100
Well, it certainly is as cold as it looks, but don't you love a White Christmas?

93
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,060
I certainly do.

94
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,780
But is it okay?

95
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,910
If we dawdle we'll keep everyone waiting.

96
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,520
Oh, no worries. Sometimes it's more fun the longer you put it off.

97
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,660
We'll return to Sazanami after you're finished with your business.

98
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,770
Uh, ok...

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
All right then, let's get a move on...

100
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,510
Taxi!

101
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,200
Listy!

102
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,080
What's wrong?

103
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,290
Are you ok?

104
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,750
It's nothing...

105
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,890
But you're as white as a sheet!

106
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,870
Don't make a big deal out of this...

107
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,000
Listy... Did you take too much medicine?

108
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,930
No, it isn't because of that. It's because of bath battle-mode...

109
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,480
Battle-mode?

110
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm sorry. Don't worry about it.

111
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,160
It's not your problem.

112
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,420
It's always been like this. I still struggle with it.

113
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,570
Listy!

114
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:53,710
Chika...

115
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,440
You don't have to say anything.

116
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,450
I can't just sit here and watch you suffer.

117
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,120
So if there's something I can do to help then I want to.

118
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,070
Chika...

119
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,600
Thank you.

120
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,870
Come here...

121
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,950
It's ok.

122
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,760
Chika... Chika...

123
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,110
Chika... It's dirty there...

124
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,890
It's fine.

125
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,110
I'm embarrassed...

126
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,400
No, no... Let it all out.

127
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,470
Onii-chan!

128
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,730
What are you doing up so late?

129
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,260
Nothing...

130
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,980
C'mon show me...

131
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,670
Yeah, I don't think so...

132
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,680
Why?

133
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,830
Because...

134
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,930
Show me!

135
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,770
No means no! It's a secret.

136
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,890
That makes me wanna see it even more!

137
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,340
No!

138
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,010
Got it!

139
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,150
So, what do we have here?

140
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,980
Onii-chan, this is...

141
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,000
Yep... It's everyone's favorite foods.

142
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,360
Everyone likes so many different things,

143
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,370
so I figured if I put it down in a notebook it would be easier to remember.

144
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,250
Wow, this is very detailed!

145
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,110
Well, I like to write so it's okay.

146
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,360
Onii-chan, you really have been protecting all of your memories of us, haven't you?

147
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,620
<i>{\an8}Since this will probably be my last meal at Sazanami, I want it to be something everyone will always remember.</i>

148
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,720
Wait? Last meal?

149
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,230
When Kanna-san comes back are you not going to be the manager anymore?

150
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,020
Are you going to have to leave? If that happens, then I...

151
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,590
I'm just a temporary replacement for Kanna-san.

152
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,890
It's not that I want to leave, I'll miss you all terribly.

153
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,570
Onii-chan...

154
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,650
But you know what?

155
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,440
Even if I'm not the manager anymore that doesn't mean I can't come around now and then.

156
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,950
Onii-chan...

157
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:07,040
You know, how about you, Kanna-san and Keigo-san all be the manager at the same time...

158
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,620
It's impossible, isn't it?

159
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,360
Although I think it's a good idea...

160
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,140
Thank you, Chika.

161
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,790
Onii-chan!

162
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,110
Uh... This is...

163
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,410
A present!

164
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,680
A present?

165
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,260
Yep. A Christmas present.

166
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,180
Listy! Have a look inside!

167
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,700
A Memory Reader!

168
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,720
This...

169
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,400
You don't like it?

170
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,950
Just the opposite! Mayuki... How did you know I wanted this?

171
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,020
I can tell by looking at you... You're just like Chika used to be.

172
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,130
Well, I have to get some work done.

173
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,100
I'll see you both at the Christmas party later.

174
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,000
Mayuki.

175
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,760
What's up?

176
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,540
Seriously, thank you for this. I'm really happy.

177
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,930
Keep smiling.

178
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,380
I'll see you guys later.

179
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,360
Thank you very much!

180
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,460
Mayuki really is mysterious.

181
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,770
She doesn't have powers like ours, but she can tell how we feel.

182
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,970
That's true, isn't it?

183
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,100
But I think it's possible that everyone on Earth possesses some sort of secret power.

184
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,320
What is it?

185
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,990
Silver Ray!

186
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,470
She's the same as you!

187
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,340
LC-20, hand over the TE-1!

188
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,190
Silver Ray, there are no serial numbers here.

189
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,650
Hey, that Silver Ray looks just like you, but...

190
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,100
I can't do this anymore... I can't take it...

191
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,940
You may not like it, but there's no helping it.

192
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,300
It's because we're not normal...

193
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,790
If you try to leave, you'll just be chased down and imprisoned.

194
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,880
You're lying...

195
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,660
You really think there are those that would accept us...?

196
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,980
Someone like that just doesn't exist.

197
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,820
This is where we belong.

198
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,520
We have nowhere else but here.

199
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,480
Even still, I want to go! Someplace that isn't here!

200
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,290
Well then, just become another doll.

201
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,880
Silver Ray, please just leave Listy alone!

202
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,840
Chika...

203
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,520
LC-20. Give it up and hand over the TE-1.

204
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,320
If not, you forfeit your life.

205
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,640
Huh? What is this?

206
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,590
How dare you do that to Mayuki's present!

207
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,780
Now's our chance. Let's get out of here!

208
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,980
She's insane!

209
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,090
Listy...

210
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,740
It's ok. I'll protect you, Chika.

211
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,830
You think you'll get away?

212
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,640
Superb... Silver Ray is hunting down LC-20.

213
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,010
And just think, when I get my hands on the TE-1,

214
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,630
what kind of fantastic creatures will I be able to bring forth?

215
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,660
Thank you. I think I'm okay now.

216
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,920
You stay here.

217
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,180
Don't go!

218
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,930
Don't stop me.

219
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,960
She's out there waiting. If I don't do this...

220
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,310
Listy!

221
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,450
LC-20, TE-1, come out. I know you're in there.

222
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,240
Listy...

223
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,100
Wait!

224
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,360
Goodbye, Chika!

225
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,720
Listy!

226
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,170
Alright, Silver Ray, come get me!

227
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,630
Too weak! You think you can take me out with that attack?

228
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,660
LC-20, stop running and fight. I've had enough of chasing you!

229
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,950
I have to get her as far away from Chika as possible.

230
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,690
Listy...

231
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,150
They are creatures created like me.

232
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,120
No matter how you look at it, they are my little sisters.

233
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,670
They were born... no, created in a lab.

234
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,143
We were all created to have abilities, to be used as weapons and deployed to battlefields.

235
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:10,148
Trained to be killing machines.

236
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,055
Africa, Timor, Burundi, South-East Asia...

237
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:16,953
We were sent everywhere.

238
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,980
That was until someone from an organization tried to save us.

239
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,970
Was that Keigo-san?

240
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,900
And they wanted me to help them counter other living weapons similar to us.

241
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,220
Counter?

242
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,472
Sorry, Keigo wanted me to protect you.

243
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:37,242
But you got involved anyway.

244
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:38,939
I'm sorry it turned out like this because of me...

245
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,850
Listy!

246
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,700
LC-20, this is the end!

247
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,460
Stop!

248
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,100
TE-1!

249
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,700
Chika, get back!

250
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,400
What is this power? Where is it coming from?

251
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,790
Silver Ray, I can't let you take her.

252
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,130
Even if it means my life!

253
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:59,690
Kosuke, Mayuki, Minami, Kaoru, Izayoi, Mio, Kaede, Yuuhi, Ai...

254
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,830
I really wanted to stay with you all...

255
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,580
Stop, Listy! That's enough.

256
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,020
Chika, this isn't a person! She's just a living weapon sent here to kill us!

257
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,490
That's not right! She is a person just like you and me...

258
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,530
I can feel the sadness in her heart!

259
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,000
We're different from your kind, Chika!

260
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,260
We're the same!

261
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,240
That girl is crying on the inside, just like you!

262
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,790
I'm not crying!

263
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,180
Then why did you say goodbye?

264
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,330
Because you're sad, right?

265
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,600
Because you want to be with everyone, right? Didn't you say you didn't want to leave?

266
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,790
Chika...

267
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,020
LC-20...

268
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,730
Hurry and kill me.

269
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,920
That's your mission, right?

270
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:57,560
Go ahead.

271
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,380
You can't die!

272
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,287
You have to keep on living!

273
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:02,548
It might hurt at times when people ignore you or treat you badly,

274
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,037
but someday you'll feel happy!

275
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,625
You'll meet people who will make you happy.

276
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:09,866
You can make that your reality.

277
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,680
You blind optimist...

278
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,090
LC-20, hurry up and give me peace.

279
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,840
You should understand.

280
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,250
That there's no point in my living anymore.

281
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,350
Silver Ray...

282
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,990
I'm sorry, Chika!

283
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,010
Stop, Listy!

284
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:42,830
Chika!

285
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,780
TE-1, why did you save me?

286
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,360
It doesn't matter who you are or how you were born.

287
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,210
Everyone has the right to be happy, and you shouldn't give up on that.

288
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,490
If we're together, I know we can be happy.

289
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,830
Isn't that right, Listy?

290
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,250
Yeah...

291
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,460
Just like back then...

292
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,250
All right then, Chika, come outside with your big sister.

293
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,050
Chika...

294
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,290
Silver Ray, what happened? Respond!

295
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,020
What in the...

296
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,680
Ryu Hakue of Ryukikan organization, isn't it?

297
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,410
You're under arrest for human trafficking, genetic manipulation, and other illegal activities.

298
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,870
You dog!

299
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,809
I'm fine with being a dog.

300
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,478
It's better than controlling people's hearts and bending them to your will!

301
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:16,950
Yes...

302
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,080
Yes, that's right.

303
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,700
Silver Ray is still alive, but you don't have to worry.

304
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,030
Silver Ray won't hurt anyone anymore.

305
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,810
I see... Okay... Great work.

306
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,010
We can consider this case closed.

307
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,170
Listy, looks like we'll make that Christmas party after all, huh?

308
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,700
Well, catch you later.

309
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,320
Good work.

310
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,330
Ok, shall we head over?

311
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:46,980
Yup!

312
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,700
Okay, everyone.

313
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,900
While you guys are all riled up and excited, I, Nimura Mayuki, will sing a song for you all!

314
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,900
Mayuki, are you sure you're okay? I mean, there's your health.

315
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,360
I was concerned about that too.

316
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,890
Shut your faces! How dare you make me remember something I was finally able to forget!

317
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,900
Hey, don't take it out on us!

318
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,590
Exactly, we're just trying to be considerate...

319
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,090
You're EVIL, I say. Evil!!

320
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Mayu-onee-chan, that's not very ladylike of you.

321
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,900
Shut your face! Uh oh?

322
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,960
Kosuke!

323
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,290
Yes?

324
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,730
What's with the getup? You going somewhere?

325
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:34,990
Kosuke-chan?

326
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,270
You caught me.

327
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,740
I thought if I left before you noticed, it would be easier on you all.

328
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,130
Leave? Where are you going?

329
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,420
To Nagasaki.

330
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,710
Kanna-san is back, so I think this part-time job is over.

331
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,690
It may have only been for a short time, but I'm so glad I met you all.

332
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,120
I truly won't forget our time together.

333
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:01,120
Oh! Speaking of which, Kanna-san, I've been putting this together since I got here.

334
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,840
If you'd like, please use it.

335
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,440
Well, Kosuke-chan, it looks like I really did pick the right person for the job.

336
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,700
All right! You can have this back.

337
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,120
From now on, you'll be the full-time manager.

338
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,890
Please keep up the good work, ok?

339
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,720
Keep up the... what are you doing, Kanna-san?

340
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,530
Me? Well, I'm...

341
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,440
Wait a minute, ok?

342
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,610
I'm going to become Keigo-san's wife!

343
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,060
Kanna-san, Keigo-san, congratulations!

344
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,730
Thank you!

345
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,520
I heard you were going to get married, but...

346
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,550
I can't believe it's to Keigo-sama...

347
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,030
You're joking, right?

348
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,700
Mio-chan, congratulations...

349
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,220
Huh? For what?

350
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,800
Well it's obvious.

351
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,220
Isn't it great Mio-chan?

352
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,370
What a wonderful mother you now have!

353
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,550
Kanna is Kanna! Kanna ain't Mama!

354
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,490
But isn't that Mama Kanna?

355
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,850
No, that isn't the point, Minami! That's not it!

356
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,410
Oh, there's my little Mio-baby...

357
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,980
- No! Let go! You're creeping me out!

358
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,710
- What a cute daughter I have!
- No! Let go! You're creeping me out!

359
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,300
I'm not cute!

360
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:21,820
Listy.

361
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:23,530
What is it?

362
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,240
My mission is over, I guess it's time for me to hit the road, huh?

363
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,000
It doesn't look like you want to.

364
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,580
I've never felt like this before. I want to face my mission head-on.

365
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,830
I'm happy for you...

366
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,240
It looks like you finally found a place where you truly belong.

367
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,700
A place where you can feel at home.

368
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,930
Where do you think you're going?

369
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,000
If you're going to return somewhere, it should be home, right?

370
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,150
Mayuki...

371
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,100
If there are people here who will say "welcome home," then this is where you live.

372
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,640
Is it okay if I stay here?

373
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,900
Yep!  We can stay together forever!

374
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,750
All right! To celebrate, I, Shiina Yuuhi, shall now sing!

375
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,040
Is it okay if I sing with you?

376
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:14,660
Sure it is!

377
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,810
Let's get started!

378
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,050
Here we go!

379
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,764
The place where, even if you're away a long time,

380
00:33:08,364 --> 00:33:13,609
where everyone says "Welcome Home" with a smile...

381
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,170
That's the place I love!

382
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,070
Welcome home!
