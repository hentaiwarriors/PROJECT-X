1
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:11,010
Date General Hospital

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,224
The victim is Date Sojiro, age 52.

3
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,976
He is the Chief of Medicine
at this hospital.

4
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,770
The head nurse found him.

5
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,189
She has a spare key to this room.

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,735
Because the windows
have latches and curtains,

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:31,447
we can think of this as a locked room.

8
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,242
And the cause of death was... heart failure?

9
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,618
Apparently so.

10
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,290
Though the records indicate he
didn't have a heart condition,

11
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,292
and his hair was still pitch-black.

12
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,171
Something wrong?

13
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,298
No. Itis nothing.

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,095
For now we're guessing that he saw or experienced
something so shocking, that he had a heart attack.

15
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,638
Yes. We believe so.

16
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,641
Still, he could have been poisoned.

17
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,143
We won't know until after the autopsy.

18
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,352
Good point.

19
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,772
And where are the two nurses?

20
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,899
In the morgue.

21
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,613
There's just one.

22
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,328
What's that about?

23
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,497
Take off the shroud.

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,064
Pact 2

25
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,740
S-Seimei?

26
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,992
Hey there!

27
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,539
So you're the detective guy? Such fun!

28
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,416
Wh-Who are you?

29
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,921
Me-ya? My name's Byakko. Nice to meet'cha.

30
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,679
Just for the record! I wasnt'spying on her.

31
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,933
I have some information
that I want to give her.

32
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,852
So don't jump to conclusions.

33
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,440
It's a light beer! Want some?

34
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,109
It's really popular these days.

35
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,985
No, thanks.

36
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,196
Really? But it's so yummy.

37
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,865
I'm on duty. I'd be crazy to drink alcohol.

38
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,867
Never mind that. Will you
fetch Seimei for me?

39
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,829
Well, let's forget about that for
now and continue spying.

40
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,496
What?

41
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,125
Hey! What's the big id

42
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,711
They can't hear ya down there.

43
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,254
Just shut up and watch.

44
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,713
I don't get it

45
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,967
Why are two women doing that to each other?

46
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,552
They're just having a little
fun in their spare time.

47
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,223
But damn, that Suzaku is such a slut.

48
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:39,194
Your eyes are staring in disapproval,
but your body sure likes it.

49
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,947
Hey, what are you doing? Cut it out!

50
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,283
Stop fighting it.

51
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,161
What you want is right before
your eyes. Just watch it.

52
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,414
Don't worry, I wont tell Seimei.

53
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,613
Damn, you're big.

54
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,516
It looks like cream, but it
tastes completely different.

55
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,479
What cha doin' there?

56
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,315
Seimei will be out soon. We're leavin'.

57
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,281
What the hell is going on?

58
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,668
Have they been autopsied?

59
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,422
Why are you avoiding my eye?

60
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,092
I'm feeling odd. Don't mind me.

61
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,927
So what do you think about this case?

62
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,638
Good question.

63
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,226
If you asked me here to see if demons
were involved, you must not know.

64
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,310
Yeah.

65
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,606
This case is too bizarre to
be the work of a human.

66
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,192
The Chief of Medicine was
alone in a locked room.

67
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,487
He received a shock that
turned his hair white and died.

68
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:50,325
Both nurses were sliced in
half and then sewn together.

69
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,411
The other halves haven't been found yet.

70
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,413
And I can't forget what you told me.

71
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,916
Demons are everywhere,
wriggling around like worms.

72
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:04,923
For starters, I've interviewed
everyone at the hospital.

73
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,174
Seimei...

74
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,178
I've called you here to help me,

75
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,806
because I believe that only
you can solve this mystery.

76
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:17,686
I know that this will put
you in danger again.

77
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,399
To be honest I almost don't want
you to help because of that.

78
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,403
Demons like that are not my enemies.

79
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,946
So don't worry.

80
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,781
What the hell are you saying?

81
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,741
You almost fainted that day,

82
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,994
and you could've died
if I hadn't been there!

83
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,620
Is that how you remember it?

84
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,710
Why do you keep saying things
that are easily misinterpreted?

85
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,045
I don't understand you.

86
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,466
Miyamoto.

87
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,383
What is it?

88
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,509
Actually, that was...

89
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,386
Yo! Whassup?

90
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,764
Jeez, what's with the long, secretive faces?

91
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,934
What'cha think of my nurse's outfit?

92
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,604
I made sure to hide my ears and tail.

93
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,648
This should work just fine, right?

94
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:10,947
You have some nerve showing your
ugly face to me again, you worm.

95
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,579
Because of your clumsy work I got
stuck in this boring place for hours!

96
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,499
What a sickening worm.

97
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,250
Funai-san! Leave him alone!

98
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,462
Let him go!

99
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,424
<i>Funai Taibo.</i>

100
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,760
<i>He's the new CEO of Funai Co.</i>

101
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:36,139
<i>Several of his trade rivals have died
mysteriously making him my prime suspect.</i>

102
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,099
<i>He's a very disreputable man.</i>

103
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,230
<i>As a result of a train accident yesterday
he's currently a patient at this hospital.</i>

104
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,901
Funai-san!

105
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,279
He's under observation
in the psychiatric ward.

106
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,532
He won't bother you here anymore.

107
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,077
So calm down already! Be still!

108
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,915
<i>Anzai Makoto.</i>

109
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,835
<i>He was the driver in the
aforementioned train accident.</i>

110
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,131
<i>The accident happened because he
suddenly jumped out of his seat.</i>

111
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,260
<i>He was brought in with a
severe case of dementia.</i>

112
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,056
Just as I thought. You're insane!

113
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,351
Go get locked up and don't come out again.

114
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,963
Taki-san.

115
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,508
Its about time to return to your room.

116
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,722
<i>Taki Mariko.</i>

117
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:04,519
<i>She tried to commit suicide many times with
her husband, but she always survived.</i>

118
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,647
<i>This has put her family deeply in debt.</i>

119
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,358
<i>Others have nicknamed her
"Mrs. Double Suicide",</i>

120
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,778
but we think the whole
suicide bit was a fake.</i>

121
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,533
After the fourth suicide
failed, she was admitted here.</i>

122
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,452
So you're saying...

123
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:25,790
that many people capable of committing these
murders happen to be here simultaneously.

124
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,459
Exactly.

125
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,046
And the one I find most suspicious is Funai.

126
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:36,635
In the train accident everyone
near him died instantly,

127
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,429
but he mysteriously survived
with just light injuries.

128
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,932
That could mean there's a demon inside him.

129
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,768
That would explain everything.

130
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,270
While that might be true...

131
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,647
What?

132
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,398
You sound unconvinced.

133
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,068
No. Its just that...

134
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,240
I am still unclear as to why you are
suddenly so interested in demons.

135
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,953
I feel I'm in danger.

136
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,957
I sometimes wonder if a demon
might be trying to control me.

137
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,920
Or perhaps you are controlling me?

138
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,630
You could say that.

139
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,218
These are the only things I can control.

140
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,262
You want to use them, don't you?

141
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,264
Yeah.

142
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,434
So, Funai-san!

143
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,229
Here's your water.

144
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:37,404
Take your time, stay still,
and have a nice drink.

145
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,744
Wh-What are you doing?

146
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:48,164
What am I doing? I think
you know what I'm doing.

147
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,042
No! Please stop this! I'm calling for help.

148
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,001
Don't go!

149
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,212
Gotcha!

150
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,432
No!

151
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,350
Mop it! Let me go!

152
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,896
Now, now, that makes me
not want to stop even more.

153
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,653
She's really putting up a fight.

154
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,071
I wonder if she's okay.

155
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,532
She's a shikigami programmed
to act out his fantasy.

156
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,451
Of course she's okay.

157
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,704
Why are you here?

158
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,540
Because Seimei is busy meditating.

159
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,919
Ignore what doesn't concern you.

160
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,046
Concentrate on your own job.

161
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,524
You're so soft. I love young women for that.

162
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:02,155
I'll bet my son would like to have you
after I'm done, don't you think?

163
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,994
Okay.

164
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,002
Come on. Open your mouth.

165
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,338
Take it in deep, or you'll be sorry.

166
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,971
Good. Good girl.

167
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:48,076
That's good. Keep it up.
Get it all the way in.

168
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,379
Good.

169
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,175
Oh, your juices are so thick.

170
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,095
Your pussy is crying tears of joy over this.

171
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,981
That hurts. Please stop.

172
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,857
Shut up!

173
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,277
If you scream, I'll stick this
all the way up to your throat.

174
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,279
Got it?

175
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,532
Come on, face me.

176
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,009
Come closer to me.

177
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,289
There you go. Go on.

178
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,207
This money is for you.

179
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,504
There. You like it don't you?
What do you think?

180
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,716
Yes, I like it

181
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,677
Oh, that's very good.

182
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,522
Don't!

183
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,315
Shut up!

184
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,858
No!

185
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,944
Hang in there until it burns!

186
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,541
Too bad about yesterday.

187
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,460
You didn't get a lead.

188
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,878
I had no choice.

189
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,423
If I hadn't intervened, the shikigami would
have turned to paper and burned up.

190
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,136
Maybe we took things a
little too far with that one.

191
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,640
Horrible news!

192
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,893
Funai was murdered!

193
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,815
I thought I smelled blood so I went in.

194
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,358
The door was locked.

195
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,864
The nurse's body disappeared!?

196
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,785
This might be a bit dangerous,
but I'm glad you're helping.

197
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,577
Thanks.

198
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,504
I'm sure Miyamoto had a reason
for asking Seimei to do this.

199
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,091
Please tell me. Why do you
keep trying to kill yoursel?

200
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,680
The police don't trust you.

201
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,351
But if you just tell them the truth,

202
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,062
they might help you.

203
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,866
Yes. Stick your tongue out more.

204
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,328
I understand you.

205
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:24,417
Even though you're ill,
you're still a good person.

206
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,588
You just like to be here because it's safe.

207
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,839
Let the doctors and nurses...

208
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,342
take care of you.

209
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,473
Wow.

210
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,226
You're already so hard.

211
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,562
See? That is a normal healthy reaction.

212
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,400
But... you seem to be in pain,

213
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,985
like someone has taken over your mind.

214
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,031
I will release you from that now.

215
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,675
I cant stand it!

216
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,021
Wow!

217
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,816
I can't go on!

218
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,904
Don't you want to touch them?

219
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,698
You may touch them.

220
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,618
If you want to touch them...

221
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:57,218
I... I saw it. I saw it. I saw the demon.

222
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,220
But no one believes me!

223
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,431
It was standing on the
tracks and glaring at me!

224
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,183
That's why I...

225
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,147
I believe you! I do
believe you! So please...

226
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,826
I-I mustn't.

227
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,412
Why are you doing this?

228
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,332
Because I want to get to know you.

229
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,795
This is the best way to
get to know each other.

230
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,756
See? I'm making you wet.

231
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,052
I can tell you don't mind.
Aren't you lonely?

232
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,929
I-I don't know what you mean.

233
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,016
You can't lie to me.

234
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:49,604
All the men you loved so dearly are dead.

235
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,525
Then, why don't we see what
it's like to love a woman?

236
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,449
Our lips are soft.

237
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,957
Our skin is beautiful.

238
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,588
Come.

239
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,757
Suck mine, too.

240
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,929
It's a beauty that no man has.

241
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,099
Good.

242
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,271
Let's do even better things.

243
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,276
Next is this.

244
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,829
You're so wet! It tickles!

245
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,043
I cant.. Stop it, please!

246
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,464
We can't stop. We've come this far.

247
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,341
We both need to be satisfied.

248
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,977
Wh-What's this?

249
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,155
Mariko-san?

250
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,492
What is this? What's going on?

251
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,413
Nurse, this is how I show my love.

252
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,373
I'm showing my love to you,

253
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,002
just like I showed my love to the others!

254
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,255
Let's all go into the water together!

255
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,384
Darling! I want to go with you!

256
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,264
But I... But I...

257
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:01,068
If only... If only I didn't
have this cursed body!

258
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:06,073
I could have stayed with him. Why me?

259
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,700
Why?

260
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,308
Are you going to sleep all night?

261
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:36,729
I know you've been exchanged. Show yourself.

262
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,570
Aw, shit. Ya got me.

263
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,865
It's the sort of plan that
a woman would create,

264
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,326
though I had hoped she would do it herself.

265
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,287
Apparently I underestimated her.

266
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,082
You think you're tough?

267
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,502
Well you ain't fought the likes of me yet.

268
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,604
You hid my prey.

269
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:22,108
As punishment I will feast
on you in her place.

270
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,985
But before that..

271
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,372
Seimei!

272
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,941
I think I'm ready to cum.

273
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,320
Just a little more.

274
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:12,158
Stay still. Otherwise,
your head will fall off.

275
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,245
I have no other way to relax!

276
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,236
Seimei!

277
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,821
Wait! Seimei!

278
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,285
Resistance is futile.

279
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,330
You cannot escape my shrine.

280
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,250
I shall now deliver the final blow!

281
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:53,092
I'm amazed that there was
a shrine to her in this city.

282
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,846
Thanks to that Byakkos powers
were increased tenfold.

283
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,722
Yeah.

284
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,641
What is it?

285
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:02,851
What do you mean?

286
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,854
You keep stopping yourself
from saying something.

287
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,439
No.

288
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:13,153
It's just that I wanted to hear what
you started to tell me yesterday.

289
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,824
If you don't want to tell me, that's okay.

290
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,534
As part of being a sorceress,

291
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:24,290
you must suppress all five senses in order
to link your spirit with a shikigami.

292
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,542
You know what I'm implying.

293
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,586
So..

294
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,256
Your body still can't merge with a man?

295
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,340
Exactly.

296
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,846
So that's why...

297
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,180
Don't you want to change?

298
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,892
But I really like it.

299
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,562
It makes me all brave and strong!

300
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,479
Really?

301
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,400
If you hate it that much, I'll change
back when we get home.

302
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,110
But I can wear it until then, right?

303
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,575
No. That's not it!

304
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,910
That's not the demon I saw!

305
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,622
That wasn't the demon I saw!

306
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,916
What's wrong

307
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,543
Nothing. I'm just hearing things.

308
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,128
It's an airplane!

309
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,345
This world is full of machines now.
