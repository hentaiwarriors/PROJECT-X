1
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:54,105
Well, this is what it means.

2
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:56,144
Does everybody understand?

3
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:59,713
You have to study
these subjects very well...

4
00:00:59,787 --> 00:01:02,347
because they might be on the exam.

5
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:07,155
Alright, the rest of the
assignment is due tomorrow.

6
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:09,990
Does anybody have any questions?

7
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:12,461
All right.
Then this is it for today.

8
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:16,903
Uh... it's bright.

9
00:01:19,673 --> 00:01:22,403
- Akiyama, got a minute?
- Yes.

10
00:01:22,476 --> 00:01:25,343
You don't belong to
any college clubs or sports?

11
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:27,471
- No.
- Then if you don't mind...

12
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:31,210
I want you to bring this
printed material to Ms. Yoshifuku.

13
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:35,016
She's been absent from college
since she became a sophomore.

14
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:38,987
She just called me to tell me
she has a bad flu.

15
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:43,557
I would like to visit her, but I have
lots of errands to take care of...

16
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,961
so I can't make time for this.

17
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:49,424
I don't mind doing that.
Where does she live?

18
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,638
Oh, I really appreciate it.

19
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:55,837
Hey, leda!
Akiyama said it's OK for him to go.

20
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:58,975
All right, then we'll go together.

21
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,581
You saved my life.

22
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:08,052
I hesitate going to a woman's
place by myself. You know?

23
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:09,919
Yeah, I think so too.

24
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:14,616
But aren't your and Yoshifuku's
houses close to each other?

25
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:18,722
Yes, we're neighbors,
but she's just moved into town...

26
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:20,733
and we never taken
the same lecture before.

27
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:24,237
To be honest with you,
I don't know her very well.

28
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,976
But I remember
she was kind of hot.

29
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:33,374
Oh, I see.

30
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:36,712
You weren't in the same lecture
with her before either.

31
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:42,219
No, but I might have
seen her before...

32
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:45,048
since we go to the same college.

33
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:49,485
You must be very popular, huh?

34
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:52,065
You're very good at sports, and...

35
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:54,225
W-what are you talking about?

36
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:56,266
You look like the ideal type
for a woman.

37
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:59,863
Well, maybe if I belonged to some
kind of popular sports club.

38
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:11,650
It's suppose to be around here.

39
00:03:12,953 --> 00:03:14,147
Ah... there it is.

40
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:24,724
- It's a really big house.
- I'll press the intercom.

41
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:25,924
Ah... y-yeah.

42
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:34,797
Maybe nobody's home?

43
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:36,901
- What should we do?
- Well...

44
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:41,138
Yes?

45
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,842
Ah... yes...

46
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:46,079
I'm someone who's taking the same
lecture as Miss Noriko Yoshifuku.

47
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:48,621
My Professor told me to bring
some printed materials for her.

48
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:52,216
Oh, thank you. Please come in.
I'll open the door right now.

49
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:57,024
Let's go!

50
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:13,202
It was gorgeous outside,
but inside is much more than that.

51
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,734
This is really spacious.

52
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:36,098
It is.

53
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:51,213
I'm sorry. I was taking a shower.
Please come in.

54
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,921
M-my eyes feasted on her.

55
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:58,653
What's the matter?

56
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,893
Ah... well... then...

57
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:02,053
Hey!

58
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,189
I heard you got the flu.
Are you all right now?

59
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:10,762
Can you wait here?
I will prepare some tea.

60
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:12,168
Sure.

61
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,672
I'm sorry, but nobody's home now.

62
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:24,108
Yoshifuku looks totally different
from when I saw her before.

63
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:26,081
Was she always that hot?

64
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,484
Hey! Akiyama,
what do you think?

65
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:34,258
W-well, I don't know about before,
but she is beautiful.

66
00:05:35,395 --> 00:05:37,556
She said that
she was taking shower.

67
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:39,223
Yeah, she did.

68
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:40,391
Akiyama!

69
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:44,166
Weren't you just
imagining that right now?

70
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:47,799
- What?
- Yoshifuku taking a shower.

71
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:57,315
N-no I wasn't!

72
00:05:57,384 --> 00:05:59,318
Oh! I should give her
the printed materials.

73
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:04,585
What are you talking about?

74
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,217
Nothing!

75
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:11,694
Oh... we still haven't
introduced ourselves.

76
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:13,699
This is Akiyama who is
also in our lecture.

77
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,166
Nice to meet you.

78
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:16,258
Hi.

79
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:18,563
And I am leda.

80
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:22,273
These are the printed materials that
the Professor asked me to give you.

81
00:06:23,277 --> 00:06:24,471
Thank you.

82
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:28,781
I guess you have already
recovered from the flu.

83
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:31,582
You can come to college
tomorrow then.

84
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:34,644
leda, isn't tomorrow
the fiirst Saturday of the month?

85
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:36,052
Ah, it's true.

86
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:38,716
It's not the flu.

87
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:44,454
I have a different kind of sickness.

88
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:47,998
Ah... s-sorry.
I didn't know that.

89
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,403
Yoshifuku...

90
00:06:57,477 --> 00:06:59,104
I have this kind of sickness.

91
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:00,612
Yoshifuku?

92
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:07,810
I think dirty things like this
all the time.

93
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:15,057
Ms. Yoshifuku... what's the matter?
What are you doing?

94
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:27,970
Come...

95
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:36,046
Come to me... please...

96
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:42,320
Hurry...

97
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:52,230
leda...

98
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:58,334
Ah... no...

99
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:07,805
C-can I?

100
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,280
Give it to me...

101
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:15,711
leda...

102
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:05,869
C-come!

103
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,668
Please... come to me!

104
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,805
Akiyama.

105
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,595
- See you next week at college.
- OK.

106
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:15,368
I'll pick you up at your place
on Monday morning.

107
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:16,602
Thank you.

108
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:17,665
See you.

109
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,206
See you. Take care.

110
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:22,614
Akiyama!

111
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,179
See you.

112
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,225
She...

113
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,859
Don't you think her illness is...

114
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:43,191
the illness that anybody has
in their late teens?

115
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:45,738
Us too.

116
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:50,673
Akiyama!

117
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:52,803
Ah, I'm sorry.
I'm embarrassed for what I said.

118
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,868
You! You!

119
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:56,379
Ouuuchhh! F-forget it.

120
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:59,076
No, it's all right.
I understand that.

121
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:02,087
We have that sickness too.

122
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:20,801
I can't sleep.

123
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:49,834
- Good morning!!
- Good morning!

124
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:09,386
Good morning!

125
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:13,256
Good morning.

126
00:12:14,227 --> 00:12:16,957
- Thank you for the other day.
- Well...

127
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:24,599
Yoshifuku, long time no see.

128
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:25,998
Yes.

129
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:29,599
I never knew there's such a
good-looking woman in our lecture.

130
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:32,975
I was in the same lecture
with you last year.

131
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:34,070
Do you remember me?

132
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:38,413
You've been absent
since the end of last year.

133
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:40,510
Have you been sick or something?

134
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:42,379
Sick...

135
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:47,287
I've been sick...

136
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:51,153
Well, well, everybody sit down.

137
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:56,334
Oh, Yoshifuku,
you've come back to college.

138
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:58,667
I'm sorry I made you worry.

139
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:01,332
- I'm glad you recovered.
- Thanks.

140
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:03,171
Let me take attendance.

141
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:04,642
- Akiyama.
- Here.

142
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:06,468
- Leda.
- Here.

143
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,270
- Shinoda.
- Here.

144
00:13:08,648 --> 00:13:09,842
- Nomura.
- Here.

145
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,617
- Hashimoto.
- Here.

146
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:14,519
- Yoshifuku.
- Here!

147
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:19,387
Yoshifuku... I'm glad she's fine.

148
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,940
OK! Ready!

149
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:49,078
There are several rules,
but for now we'll just make it...

150
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:52,454
that if anybody in the outside team
circles around three times, wins!

151
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:55,085
If you step out from your line,
then you lose.

152
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,857
We will switch the teams when
everybody on the same team loses.

153
00:13:57,931 --> 00:13:58,920
Ready, set, go!

154
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:01,029
Rock-paper-scissors!

155
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,931
Takaradon!!

156
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,804
- I'll go over there!
- Leave it to me!

157
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,318
Wait!

158
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,233
You did it!

159
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:42,563
Yoshifuku is really hot.

160
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:46,373
Akiyama, thank you.

161
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:50,079
W-well, Yoshifuku.

162
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:53,310
What is it?

163
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:56,947
I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.

164
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,718
I forgot what I was trying to say.

165
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:03,153
Please let me know
when you remember.

166
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:06,198
And... can you come
and visit me again?

167
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:11,065
All right, let's play!

168
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,155
Let's play Takaradon again.
That was fun, wasn't it?

169
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:40,793
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you.

170
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,576
Uh... I wanted to be
with her little more.

171
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,174
Uh? What's wrong with me?

172
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:58,549
I really had fun today.

173
00:15:58,618 --> 00:16:00,449
Can we do something
together again tomorrow?

174
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,612
Yeah.

175
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:05,018
Everybody was very nice to me too.

176
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,049
What's wrong?

177
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:10,523
This is where I live.

178
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:17,800
Wow, your house is
very close to mine.

179
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:23,741
- Then I'll see you...
- Yoshifuku.

180
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,442
I think there was nobody at
your place last time I visited you.

181
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,277
Is it the same today?

182
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,614
No?

183
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:35,776
Yes.

184
00:16:36,022 --> 00:16:39,321
Uh... then... why don't you
stop by at my place?

185
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:41,519
It's kind of small, but...

186
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:46,462
Ah... great.

187
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:49,231
I'm home.

188
00:16:53,673 --> 00:16:56,039
This is my room.
Can you wait a minute?

189
00:16:56,109 --> 00:16:58,100
I'll clean it up quickly.

190
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:00,544
Brother!!

191
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:04,906
Hey!

192
00:17:04,984 --> 00:17:08,112
I told you not to go in my room
without asking me fiirst.

193
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:09,620
Yeah, yeah.

194
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:13,189
This is my sister, Miyuki.

195
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:15,750
This lady is Ms. Yoshifuku.
We're in the same lecture.

196
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:16,817
Nice to meet you.

197
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:19,829
Is she your girlfriend?

198
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:22,197
That's not quite...
We're just...?

199
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:24,031
Y-yea...

200
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:26,634
Miyuki, when you go downstairs...

201
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:29,504
please ask mom to
prepare dinner for her too.

202
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:32,804
No, don't worry about it.

203
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,747
It's all right.

204
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:37,874
You have a nice sister.

205
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:39,075
Ah... yeah.

206
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,032
You have so many interesting
things in your room.

207
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:07,313
Sorry it's so messy.

208
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,577
No, I didn't mean that.

209
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,111
I have so many things I want to do.

210
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:18,350
I was in the basketball club
in junior High...

211
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:20,790
and I joined the tennis club
when I was in High School...

212
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,490
but I want to do other things too,
so time is important to me.

213
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:28,226
Do you belong to
any clubs right now?

214
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:29,593
Not at all.

215
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:32,528
I'm kind of easy going.

216
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:37,508
So I've already decided that
I won't join any club in college.

217
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:42,946
I envy you.
You can do the things you decide.

218
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:47,319
I can't control myself at all.

219
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,646
Yoshifuku...

220
00:18:50,323 --> 00:18:52,052
Make love to me.

221
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,904
Do it as much as you want
this time.

222
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:12,839
Try to stay quiet.

223
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:54,913
Brother.

224
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:13,498
Do you hate me?

225
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:18,337
No, it's not that
I hate you... but...

226
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:22,577
You don't like women
who want to do this?

227
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:26,448
No... it's not that.
I do like you.

228
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,650
That's why I'm happy...

229
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:39,923
I like you too, Satoshi.

230
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:48,535
Look at this. It's ripe and juicy.
I'm sick.

231
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:51,133
Can you cure me?

232
00:20:55,982 --> 00:21:00,282
I did it again.
I'm the sick one.

233
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,986
But... I can't forget about her.
I still can't.

234
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:10,588
See you tomorrow.

235
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:11,925
See you!

236
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:14,355
Of course it is.

237
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:17,035
Have a good afternoon too.

238
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,466
No, you can't!

239
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:30,138
Yoo-hoo! Akiyama.

240
00:21:31,517 --> 00:21:32,609
Yoshifuku.

241
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:36,687
Let's go home together.
I'm alone today too.

242
00:21:42,895 --> 00:21:44,192
What happened to leda?

243
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,531
He has to stay at college
for practice today.

244
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,501
He was selected as a member of
the ball game tournament.

245
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,970
leda is really good
at playing sports.

246
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:58,501
Akiyama,
you are often by yourself.

247
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:01,045
I kind of enjoy being alone.

248
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:03,742
I'm not so good at talking to people.

249
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:06,943
You must be bored
being with me.

250
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:12,614
I don't like that kind of
self-evaluation.

251
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:17,125
I'm a lot like that myself.

252
00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:23,190
Ah... what?
What's wrong with me?

253
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:30,073
Akiyama, let's go to my place.

254
00:24:07,173 --> 00:24:08,697
This is like a dream.

255
00:24:24,223 --> 00:24:27,954
Since that first day
I was dreaming about this.

256
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:31,287
just the two of us
together like this.

257
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,463
I was waiting for this too.

258
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:41,266
We could've done this anytime.

259
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:43,338
But... I thought leda was...

260
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:48,103
leda and you are both my friends.
Important friends.

261
00:24:49,782 --> 00:24:53,013
Let's do this again
with the three of us.

262
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:54,143
Yes.

263
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:57,745
What did you just do?

264
00:24:58,357 --> 00:24:59,688
Here we go.

265
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,856
Oh, you!
