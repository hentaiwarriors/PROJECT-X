1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,700
My name is Shiori Tachikawa.

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,170
This is my favorite high school teacher...

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,807
Ms. Yayoi Mizuno.

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,808
All of us worshipped
and admired Ms. Mizuno.

5
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,405
We loved her as our teacher...

6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,278
and spending time with her made us happy.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,746
We thought those days would last forever.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,582
However, Ms. Mizuno was recently engaged!

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,686
Her fiancee is our biology teacher,
Mr. Tatsuya Kubo.

10
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:34,460
So the members of Ms Mizuno's fan club...

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,229
went on a farewell trip.

12
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,801
Members include the slutty Kyoko Sahara...

13
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:42,134
the athletic Yuko Koizumi...

14
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:47,374
Akemi Yashiro, Yuko's best friend,
and myself.

15
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:53,015
Kyoko's boyfriend,
Tetsuji Tsuchiya, also came along.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,384
The first day was a real blast.

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,987
Especially at night!

18
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:01,783
Everyone was having a lot of fun
with their partners.

19
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,359
I didn't have a partner, though.

20
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:09,234
Tetsuji's feelings for Yuko wasn't mutual.

21
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,066
In the middle of the night...

22
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,936
a storm tore through our camp.

23
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,237
With only the clothes on our back...

24
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,009
we ran into the forest for cover.

25
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:31,521
Looking for food,
we wandered through the forest.

26
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,324
We were soon separated from our teachers.

27
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,929
Deep inside the forest...

28
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,223
a horrible fate was waiting for us.

29
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,302
We were oblivious to the impending terrors.

30
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,242
What was that for?

31
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,577
I can give you some food.

32
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,713
I don't want it.

33
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,915
What a fine body.

34
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,684
Please stop!

35
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,591
Fifty years ago,
I worked for the government.

36
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,261
I was researching biological weapons.

37
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,932
I was cross-breeding different plants...

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,093
and made countless number
of genetic mistakes, until...

39
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,502
I succeeded with the Garanta.

40
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,732
The Garanta has never seen
a human woman.

41
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:28,113
I'm going to make sure the Garanta
really likes you.

42
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,479
No!

43
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,221
Go away!

44
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,349
No!

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,833
Tatsuya!

46
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:38,773
School of Darkness 3

47
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,455
Yayoi...

48
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,321
Yayoi...

49
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:48,953
Yayoi...

50
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:51,731
Yayoi...

51
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,829
Yayoi?

52
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,172
Yayoi!

53
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,373
Yayoi! Yayoi!

54
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,108
Yayoi.

55
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,385
She didn't fall from here?

56
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,762
Where am I?

57
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,328
What's happening to me?

58
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,270
Someone...

59
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,167
come get me!

60
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,036
Hurry!

61
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,469
Please help me.

62
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,213
That's...

63
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,251
it's Tatsuya!

64
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,082
Please Tatsuya...

65
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:30,882
Please!

66
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,391
Please hurry!

67
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,190
Help me get out of here!

68
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,252
No!

69
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,655
Wait!

70
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,287
Don't go!

71
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,328
Wait, Tatsuya!

72
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,197
Don't leave me here!

73
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,901
Tatsuya!

74
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,267
Help me!

75
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,508
Help me!

76
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,538
Tatsuya!

77
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,423
I wonder where our teachers are.

78
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,259
Everyone's asleep.

79
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,267
They must be really tired.

80
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,675
I'm really exhausted, but I can't sleep.

81
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:24,935
Ms. Mizuno...

82
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:28,575
please, come back to us, soon.

83
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,515
Shiori!

84
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:33,949
Morning.

85
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,250
Are you okay?

86
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,420
Yeah.

87
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,521
Our teachers haven't come back yet.

88
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,722
Don't tell me you stayed up all night?

89
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,193
Yeah.

90
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,591
Get some sleep, now that I'm awake.

91
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,363
No.

92
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,835
We need to find food,
and look for our teachers.

93
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,537
I can go look for food by myself.

94
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,070
I'll help you.

95
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,112
Let's go together, then.

96
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,941
Kyoko, time to get up.

97
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,346
Wake up, we need to go look for more food.

98
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,679
I'll go, too.

99
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,389
You need to sleep.

100
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,784
Don't worry.
I'm sure Tetsuji will bring back more food.

101
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,854
Shit, get up you lazy bum!

102
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,526
I haven't seen Tetsuji at all
since last night, either.

103
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,062
Don't worry about Tetsuji.

104
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,230
Even a bear couldn't kill him.

105
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:33,207
The guys will be fine,
but I'm worried about Ms. Mizuno.

106
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,809
We should...

107
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,711
split up into two pairs and gather more food
and find Ms. Mizuno.

108
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:39,741
Yeah.

109
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,784
Let's plan on meeting back
at this spot in two hours.

110
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,459
I'll look after the fire, so have fun!

111
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,892
You're coming too!

112
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,158
Yayoi...

113
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,227
Yayoi.

114
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,261
Where did you go?

115
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,601
Yayoi!

116
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,598
No, please stop!

117
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,769
Why are you?

118
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,040
No!

119
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,274
Stop!

120
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,484
Let me go!

121
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,157
No, stop!

122
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,619
Stop!

123
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,690
No!

124
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,126
Wait, maybe she's still there!

125
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,897
Stop, I'm tired!

126
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,494
I'm exhausted too.

127
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,603
Don't be such a wimp.

128
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,265
I can't walk anymore.

129
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,870
What is it?

130
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,811
Look, Kyoko!

131
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,016
What could this be?

132
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,743
It looks like some kind of hut.

133
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,222
Maybe somebody lives in it.

134
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,857
Excuse me!

135
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,588
Is anybody home?

136
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,836
Maybe it's abandoned.

137
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,665
But it looks like it's being used.

138
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,143
That means there might be food here!

139
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,446
Right!

140
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,452
There's lots of nuts in here!

141
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,089
Kyoko, look, there's food over here, too.

142
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,219
We did it!

143
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,196
See, there's potatoes, and dried fish.

144
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,525
What about...

145
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,925
Wow, it's canned food!

146
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,170
There's so much food, let's go get everyone!

147
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,173
Whoa, it's you two.

148
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,454
Mr. Kubo!

149
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,685
Good. I'm glad at least two
of you are safe.

150
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,991
Progress, at last.

151
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,698
We at least found Mr. Kubo,
and enough food for everyone for a while.

152
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,765
We heard about the man
that owns this cottage...

153
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,407
and the horrible event
that occurred last night.

154
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,638
I couldn't stop shaking for a few hours.

155
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,509
So, do you know what happened
to Ms. Mizuno?

156
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:23,981
Don't know.

157
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,548
I thought I might possibly find her
here, but...

158
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,180
I'm worried about the others.

159
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,922
That creepy guy is still wandering
the forest, right?

160
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,023
They might be in danger!

161
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,597
We have food now,
so let's bring the others over here.

162
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,930
Yeah, we should go.

163
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,993
Yes, but Kyoko should stay here.

164
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,640
Shiori should be able to find them...

165
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,836
but I'm going to need your help here.

166
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,637
Sure.

167
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,116
I can't do this!

168
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,552
I just can't walk anymore.

169
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:03,145
What?

170
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,755
At this rate, we're all going to starve
to death out here.

171
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,454
Hey, cheer up.

172
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,561
Hunkering down isn't going to
solve anything.

173
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:18,398
Wait!

174
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,270
Yuko, was it Mr. Kubo?

175
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,738
No, but it was a person, for sure!

176
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,369
Excuse me, please wait!

177
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,913
We got lost during that horrible storm
several days ago, and...

178
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,022
I thought...

179
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:42,389
you might have enough food
to share with us.

180
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,095
Not on me,
but I do have some in my cabin.

181
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,062
So you must live close to here?

182
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,094
And if I did?

183
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,167
Could you call the local police for us,
so we can get help?

184
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,732
Unfortunately, the phone lines are out.

185
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,672
I can't call for help.

186
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,042
I understand.

187
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,279
I can give you some food, though.

188
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,615
Will you, really?

189
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:07,384
But...

190
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:11,383
only if you agree to help me
with my experiment.

191
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,556
What experiment?

192
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,288
It won't take too long.

193
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,824
Follow me.

194
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,495
No thank you.

195
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,806
Hey wait, I have something here.

196
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,900
You must be hungry.

197
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,203
No, that's all right.

198
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,672
Don't worry, it's not poison.

199
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:40,414
It's a stimulant derived
from the nectar of a plant.

200
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,651
It'll give you energy.

201
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,188
See, it's not poison.

202
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,423
This is all I have,
but it should be enough for you.

203
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,425
Here, take this with you, okay?

204
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,706
Just come by the cabin
if you change your mind.

205
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,736
It's near the waterfall, you can't miss it.

206
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,823
Is it okay?

207
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,761
- It's sweet.
- Really?

208
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,292
Akemi, have some.

209
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,097
Wait, make sure you don't spill it!

210
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,977
Let me have some more!

211
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,912
What about the others?

212
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:48,453
There isn't enough for everyone,
so we'll just have to finish it off.

213
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:49,784
I agree.

214
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,495
Tickles!

215
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,408
It's all gone.

216
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,481
We can go look for that old man's cabin?

217
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,549
No, he was a creepy bastard.

218
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,892
You're right, he'll probably
do weird things to us.

219
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:34,260
I bet it's probably a trick
to lure helpless women.

220
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:35,666
I'm scared!

221
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,167
We won't fall for that one!

222
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,788
What the hell happened here?

223
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,987
What did this?

224
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,119
As you can see...

225
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,731
You are?

226
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,163
I see!

227
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,867
So, it finally happened, I can't believe it!

228
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:51,075
You aren't exhibiting any side effects,
like skin rashes.

229
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,143
It has not affected your beautiful body!

230
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,608
This is beyond my wildest expectations!

231
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,445
What did you do to my body?

232
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,246
Why does it matter now?

233
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,616
There is no way to reverse the changes.

234
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,453
Tell me!

235
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,496
Tell me now!

236
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,529
Why can't you reverse the changes?

237
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,773
I never imagined such perfect results!

238
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:22,972
Result?

239
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,301
Is this another crazy experiment of yours?

240
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,573
Correct.

241
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,282
I'll oblige, since you insist.

242
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:35,348
The Garanta has succeeded
in genetically merging with you.

243
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:43,723
The Garanta evolved,
and it became more than a plant.

244
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,190
It just needed a highly intelligent animal...

245
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,466
I needed to merge it with a human.

246
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,637
However, that was not a simple task.

247
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,966
The Garanta genes are extremely dominant.

248
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,667
It quickly overpowered the hosts'
genes and took over.

249
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,808
Every single test subject...

250
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,645
suffered from severe side effects,
and died from shock.

251
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,786
You are my first successful outcome.

252
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,384
You are proof that my theory was accurate!

253
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,899
Your DNA was suitable for the Garanta.

254
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,897
It's an honor.

255
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,164
You are now the ultimate biological weapon!

256
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,107
This isn't over just yet, mind you!

257
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,111
This is only the beginning.

258
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,543
As a biological organism,
you need to reproduce.

259
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,320
As you can see...

260
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:47,925
the first generation Garanta
has completed its job.

261
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,062
Yes, now it is your turn.

262
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,092
Your progeny will descend
upon this planet...

263
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,697
and completely conquer
the miserable human race!

264
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,140
Stop it!

265
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,178
What are you doing, Akemi?

266
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,281
Stop!

267
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,519
Here!

268
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,392
Stop!

269
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,391
Take this!

270
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,197
I'll get you!

271
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,685
I've been feeling really strange.

272
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:59,591
I'm tingling deep down inside there,
and I'm feeling very horny.

273
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,798
Me too, and I can't take it anymore.

274
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,296
Let's do it!

275
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,471
Yes, let's.

276
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,418
Yes, Yuko!

277
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,253
It feels so good!

278
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,586
Wait.

279
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,025
What is it, Akemi?

280
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,063
I'm not comfortable doing it in the water.

281
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,372
Come over here, Yuko.

282
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,579
Where did you learn
to be so sexy and seductive?

283
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,183
Not telling.

284
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,748
Naughty girl!

285
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,198
Just like that!

286
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,733
More, lick harder!

287
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:20,474
Yes!

288
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,304
I love it, Yuko.

289
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,211
I don't think I can take this much longer!

290
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,346
Yes!

291
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,401
So, does this feel good, Akemi?

292
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,961
Yes, yes!

293
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,542
Louder, I want to hear you!

294
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,674
God, you make me feel so good!

295
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,650
I think I'm going to come!

296
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:21,617
Yes, I'm going to come hard, too!

297
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:26,155
Akemi, come, come for me, come with me!

298
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,672
I see.

299
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:39,870
The hot stud decided to show up!

300
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:43,837
So, are you just going
to stand there like that?

301
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,140
Well...

302
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,411
I was looking.

303
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,754
Look at his face, Akemi.

304
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,950
Just like a deer in headlights.

305
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:53,486
He does!

306
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,062
I'd bet he's been watching us
have fun all this time.

307
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,797
How rude of him.

308
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,694
I'll leave you two alone!

309
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,400
Wait a minute.

310
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,372
You really want to join us, right?

311
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,678
We honestly don't mind at all, you know.

312
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,339
Stop it, don't fuck with me.

313
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,576
Now, don't be a party pooper.

314
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,486
I know you want me.

315
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,721
It's so obvious.

316
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:34,664
Here, you can do what you want
to my body.

317
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,466
Yuko, why?

318
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,473
Say something?

319
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,006
What's gotten into you?

320
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,882
Nothing's wrong.

321
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:53,343
Let's have some fun.

322
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,547
I'm not stupid.

323
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,153
Here Tetsuji, I have a treat!

324
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,469
Stop it!

325
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:16,606
Don't play me for a fucking fool, damn it.

326
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,468
Is he okay?

327
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,476
Tetsuji, I thought you wanted me
for a long time?

328
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:28,217
You bitch, I did. Damn!

329
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,485
Wow, that was quick.

330
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:33,090
See, guys just suck.

331
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,090
I'm hungry again.

332
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:39,887
We were supposed to be looking for
food and Ms. Mizuno.

333
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:44,265
In that case, let's look
for that creepy guy's cabin.

334
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:48,503
Yeah, he did say that he would
give us some food.

335
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,507
This is unbelievable.

336
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,343
Her powers are just amazing!

337
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,524
Yes, rage is good!

338
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,330
Anger is going to be the fuel
for your new power!

339
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,399
You're going to kill me?

340
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,874
You idiot, that won't help you!

341
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,378
We still don't know
what's going to happen to you!

342
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:34,510
How are you going to live on your own?

343
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,179
No, listen to me!

344
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,028
Ms. Mizuno!

345
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,900
Do I look like Ms. Mizuno to you?

346
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,469
It's just you.

347
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,238
Yeah, it's just me.

348
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:38,505
I see. The hot stud decided
to show up!

349
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,747
Yuko and Akemi are late.

350
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,922
I've been waiting for them forever.

351
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,317
A weird old man lives around here.

352
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:52,395
He kidnaps women, so I'm worried.

353
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,694
I saw them earlier.

354
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:55,891
Where?

355
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,193
On the lake shore.

356
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,529
Were they okay?

357
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:03,941
I thought they were acting
kind of strange.

358
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,144
Were they acting really horny?

359
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:07,572
You could say that.

360
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,976
No!

361
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,114
What if Mr. Kubo was telling the truth?

362
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,017
Now it's not just Ms. Mizuno.

363
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,217
What?

364
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:22,083
Damn him, why do I have to do this
kind of shit?

365
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,557
What an asshole.

366
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,400
Mr. Kubo!

367
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,108
You're eating all of the canned food.

368
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:42,079
Idiot, I'm not eating all of the canned food!

369
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,276
You don't have to get so pissed off.

370
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,647
That creepy old guy could come back here.

371
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,855
I need strength to protect you.

372
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,287
All right, I believe you.

373
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,218
I'll leave the water here.

374
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,285
You want some of this?

375
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:01,126
What do you think?

376
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,965
If you give me some...

377
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,832
I won't tell the others you ate most of it.

378
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,603
Good, we have a deal, but first...

379
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:11,437
But first?

380
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,908
You'll let me sample your body, too.

381
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:15,680
What?

382
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,274
Well...

383
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,513
What now?

384
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,214
What about Ms. Mizuno?

385
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,651
She'll never know!

386
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:23,750
Mr. Kubo!

387
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,754
Okay, I'll do it.

388
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,324
Don't be so rough.

389
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,863
That's a good girl.

390
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:36,931
Food won't be the only thing
you'll swallow today.

391
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:42,736
Suck on it baby, I know you're hungry.

392
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:49,540
I'm sorry, Ms. Mizuno!

393
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,145
That's very good.

394
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:10,368
That's right, keep sucking my hard cock.

395
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,275
Yeah, just like that.

396
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,595
Shit, I'm going to come!

397
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,969
Yeah, I want you to come inside my mouth!

398
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,499
You'll have plenty to swallow.

399
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,474
Hurry, I want to taste you!

400
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,050
Do you like it?

401
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,446
Yummy, thank you.

402
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,818
But, I'm just getting started.

403
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,391
I want more.

404
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,493
Damn it, you selfish little girl.

405
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,138
Tatsuya.

406
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,608
What wrong, you want it, right?

407
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:29,339
But, this is embarrassing.

408
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,279
Shut up and spread them wide.

409
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:33,740
Like this?

410
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,851
That's perfect.

411
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,881
Why are you making me do this?

412
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,859
Men need a break
before we can get hard again.

413
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:43,622
How lame!

414
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,390
Just shut up and spread your pussy more.

415
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:51,364
You pervert, do you make Ms. Mizuno
do this kind of thing?

416
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,393
What?

417
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,769
I'll put you in your place, girl.

418
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,840
Not like this!

419
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,946
That's a nice view.

420
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,446
Stop it, you sick bastard!

421
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,447
No!

422
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,690
That's it, I can't wait anymore.

423
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,688
Not yet.

424
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,424
Give me!

425
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,229
Then tell me do you want!

426
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,367
Fuck me!

427
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:26,994
With what?

428
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,229
Your cock!

429
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,468
Where do you want my hard cock?

430
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,571
Put it in there.

431
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,412
Put it in where?

432
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,012
My pussy!

433
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,977
Shove it deep in my wet pussy!

434
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,384
You are such a dirty slut.

435
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,783
Don't make me wait, please.

436
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:47,481
I want it!

437
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,750
You asked for it.

438
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,265
God, this feels amazing, yes!

439
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,270
Yeah, keep doing that, keep going!

440
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,633
My god!

441
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,837
Now fuck me harder, much harder!

442
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,144
Yeah!

443
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,447
More!

444
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,691
Good, I'll come with you!

445
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,327
Yeah, I'm coming, now!

446
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:37,908
Ms. Mizuno!

447
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:42,006
Having fun, my Tatsuya?

448
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,115
I can explain everything, Yayoi.

449
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,882
Don't bother, because it doesn't bother me
to see you have fun.

450
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,855
So, would you mind if I joined you two?

451
00:34:58,696 --> 00:34:59,822
Ms. Mizuno?

452
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,095
I hope you don't mind?

453
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,397
I don't know...

454
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:10,437
Let's have lots of fun.

455
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,670
Right, Tatsuya?

456
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,670
Yayoi.

457
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,630
Ms. Mizuno!

458
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:57,979
God!

459
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,355
I'm losing my mind!

460
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,731
Ms. Mizuno!

461
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,333
I've never felt so good!

462
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,007
You're the best, baby.

463
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,049
No baby, you're the best.

464
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,581
Thank you, Tatsuya!

465
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,963
So this is what it looks like.

466
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,670
I've never seen it this close!

467
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,858
What is this?

468
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,334
Ms. Mizuno?

469
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,341
No!

470
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,109
Stop!

471
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:02,770
Stop!

472
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:06,149
Please, don't kill me!

473
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,480
You don't need to be afraid.

474
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:13,418
I already got what I wanted from him.

475
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,719
I do have a special gift for you.

476
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,326
Will you accept?

477
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,223
No!

478
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:21,762
Don't!

479
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,238
What was that noise?

480
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,777
That sounded like Kyoko!

481
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:34,835
Let's go!

482
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,475
Kyoko!

483
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,254
Ms. Mizuno!

484
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,192
Is everything okay?

485
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,894
Get out, run Akemi!

486
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:03,869
Yuko!

487
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,978
Akemi!

488
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:37,499
Ms. Mizuno, your pussy tastes
like that nectar.

489
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,970
Akemi, no, get out of here!

490
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,226
Akemi!

491
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,911
Ms. Mizuno?

492
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,252
Shiori, I haven't found Yuko or Akemi.

493
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,045
What's up?

494
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,719
I heard Ms. Mizuno's voice.

495
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,020
Hey! Wait up!

496
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,113
She isn't here.

497
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,882
Let's keep looking.

498
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:57,516
What's wrong?

499
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,053
For some reason,
I thought she would be here.

500
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,058
Why?

501
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:06,025
Ms. Mizuno adores white flowers.

502
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:07,388
I thought...

503
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,035
- What the...
- An earthquake!

504
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,841
- Let's run!
- But, Ms. Mizuno!

505
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:23,744
Just run fast!

506
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:37,561
Shiori, run!

507
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,488
No, stop!

508
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:10,259
Please!

509
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,156
Stop, Ms. Mizuno!

510
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,096
Ms. Mizuno, why are you doing this to me?

511
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:30,045
Shiori, that's not Ms. Mizuno!

512
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:31,272
You monster!

513
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,488
Ms. Mizuno, I really liked you!

514
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,311
No!

515
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,078
Stop, stop!

516
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,617
What did I ever do to you!

517
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,829
Here, put this on.

518
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,939
We both made it, Tetsuji!

519
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:41,010
Yeah.

520
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:45,779
Let's go.

521
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:14,372
We've located
a mummified body, male!

522
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:15,969
Three bodies, all female.

523
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,709
The female bodies are nude,
and covered in strange rashes.

524
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:21,445
Approximate time of death within 4 hours.

525
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,211
Team 2 here!

526
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,785
We've found 2 bodies,
one of unknown origin, and one human.

527
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,015
Sex, female.

528
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:32,385
We've located another body,
male, possible owner of the motorcycle.

529
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,091
We've found a survivor, young female!

530
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:39,666
Looking for identification.

531
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,939
The Garanta has survived!

532
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,835
It survives inside that girl now!
