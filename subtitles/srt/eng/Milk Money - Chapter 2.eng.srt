1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,166
You've been such a bad boy!

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,965
Making love to someone other than me!

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:11,041
If you ever do that again, you're
really going to be in trouble!

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,304
Yes, Nanny.

5
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,209
Touji, I know you're a good boy.

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,541
Nanny...

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,622
That feels good!

8
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,622
Nanny, can I?

9
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,620
Come here.

10
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,153
Let it all out inside Nanny!

11
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,085
Pour it all inside me, Touji!

12
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,498
You're my baby, Touji.

13
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:17,475
Don't worry, I'll love
you more than anyone else.

14
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,220
<i>MILK MONEY Chapter 2</i>

15
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,570
I wonder if Marika's still sleeping?

16
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,308
Today's Saturday, so
she's probably sleeping in.

17
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,681
Even so...

18
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,484
Marika! You should get up now.

19
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,085
Marika!

20
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,955
Marika, get out of
bed, for heavers sake!

21
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,885
I'm going to open the door.

22
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,389
I know it's a Saturday,
but enough's enough...

23
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,237
Marika, when did she...

24
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,650
You're my baby, Touji.

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,896
Don't worry, I'll love
you more than anyone else.

26
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,097
Mom...

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,360
Touji...

28
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,369
Just what's going on
between you? And why?

29
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,648
Marika, what's up?

30
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,212
I have something I
want to ask you, Touji.

31
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,413
Hey, you're scaring me, kind of.

32
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,484
Last night I saw you in the basement.

33
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,992
You and my mom...

34
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,964
Want to come in?

35
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,060
Yes.

36
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,510
Why?

37
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,950
Why, Touji?

38
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,486
Tell me why...

39
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,157
What a terrible thing to do...

40
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,625
I mean, she's my mother!

41
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,029
I've never heard of such a thing...

42
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,362
What am I supposed to do?

43
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,630
I really liked you, Touji!

44
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,333
That's not all, what you did is filthy!

45
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,645
Did you forget that my
mom was your wet-nurse?

46
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:12,049
Maybe you're not related by blood
but it's still a filthy thing to do!

47
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,480
So you saw us, Marika.

48
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,284
I see...

49
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,488
You saw me and Nanny...

50
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,353
Is that it?

51
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,189
Is that all there is to it?

52
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,889
But then why did you have sex with me?

53
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,297
Why in the world did
you have sex with me?

54
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,688
I'm not sure what to say to you...

55
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,215
I don't know why myself.

56
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:56,488
But ever since I was a boy,
I've always had a crush on Kyoko...

57
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,928
...that is, your mother.

58
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,296
You might think it's ridiculous...

59
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,495
...but ever since I can remember,
you could say I loved her.

60
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:08,166
At the time, my own parents
were both busy with their work...

61
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,902
...so I had no one else
but Kyoko to turn to.

62
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,140
But when my mother found out,
she threw Kyoko out of the house.

63
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,221
It was something that
happened all of a sudden.

64
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,350
Ever since that day...

65
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,588
...I've never been able to forget
Kyoko or what she meant to me.

66
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,158
Strange, huh?

67
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,667
Not being able to forget
the woman who breast-fed you.

68
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,234
I'm sure there's something
wrong with me, myself.

69
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,170
Please stop.

70
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:50,080
Please, I want you to forget my mother.

71
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,181
I want you to fall in love with me!

72
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,448
I'll do anything for you, Touji!

73
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,649
Please, I want you to love me!

74
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,188
Marika...

75
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,184
Touji.

76
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,326
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,125
No, it's all right.

78
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,326
Thank you for understanding.

79
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,690
Marika...

80
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,500
Touji...

81
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:29,922
Harder!

82
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,514
Harder, thrust into me harder, Touji!

83
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,498
That's right, just like
you did to Mom last night!

84
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,261
I want you to screw me even
harder, like there's no tomorrow!

85
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,339
Feels so good!

86
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,967
Touji, that feels amazing!

87
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,429
That feels great, Marika.

88
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,498
Touji, your thing is so
hard and tastes so good...

89
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,629
I'm never going to leave your side...

90
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,345
Marika...

91
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:40,551
Yes!

92
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,636
Right there, right there!

93
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,972
You're hitting my spot!

94
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,507
Touji, I can feel the
very end of your penis!

95
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,920
Yes!

96
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,551
I can't hold it, I'm pulling out.

97
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,459
Touji, your penis is
getting bigger inside me!

98
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,489
I love you, I love you!

99
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,157
I want you to come
right inside me, Touji!

100
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,002
I'm coming!

101
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,942
Touji...

102
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,113
This is for you.

103
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,316
What is it?

104
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,161
That's my good-luck charm.

105
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,363
Good-luck charm?

106
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,193
Yes.

107
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,160
I want you to keep that with you, Touji.

108
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,968
If my mom ever tries to seduce you...

109
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,435
...I want you to look
at that and remember me.

110
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,433
Okay.

111
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,430
<i>TO: TOUJI'S CELL PHONE</i>

112
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,629
<i>TRANSMISSION REPORT: Unable to</i>
<i>complete; unknown address</i>

113
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,337
You won't be able to
contact Touji anymore.

114
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,605
You have no chance.

115
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,480
Marika! What have you done?

116
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,180
What did you tell Touji?

117
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,187
Mom, I want you to calm down
and listen to what I have to say.

118
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,188
What did you do, Marika?

119
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,057
Why did you do it, Mom?

120
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,631
Don't you think it's
a bizarre thing to do?

121
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,962
It has nothing to do with you!

122
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,362
It does, too!

123
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,300
I don't want my own
mother to do such a thing!

124
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,902
Just how much older are you than him?

125
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,209
That's not the only thing.

126
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,938
You're his mother figure, aren't you?

127
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,306
It's abnormal!

128
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,947
Abnormal?

129
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,516
Another thing, I have
feelings for Touji.

130
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,017
I'm in love with him.

131
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,052
I don't want to lose him, even to you.

132
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,588
So please, just don't see him anymore.

133
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,459
Touji's not going to
contact you anymore...

134
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,960
He chose me!

135
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,565
So please, give him up.

136
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,100
Even if you carry on for now,
you and Touji have no future.

137
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,103
It's pointless, don't you see?

138
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,271
You're right.

139
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,101
If two people can't talk
about the future together...

140
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,304
...then it can't
possibly be love, can it?

141
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,643
So you do understand now, Mom?

142
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,211
I won't see Touji anymore.

143
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,653
I'll do just as you asked.

144
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:03,025
I'm really sorry, Mom, but
I do think it's for the best.

145
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,930
Don't see him anymore, and please
keep that promise for me, okay?

146
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,501
Then maybe someday...

147
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,662
...you'll be able to see him again, and
it'll be like this never happened, right?

148
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,433
Mom, thank you for being understanding.

149
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,438
Well, I'm really tired
so I'm going to bed, okay?

150
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,457
Mom...

151
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,562
I won't have it...

152
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,328
No one will get in my
way, not even you, Marika.

153
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,561
Touji is mine.

154
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,202
I'll never let anyone
take him away from me.

155
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,435
Touji is in love with you?

156
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,205
That's not possible.

157
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,144
I'm the one who raised
that boy on my milk.

158
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,514
How could he possibly fall
in love with anyone else?

159
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,245
Your cell phone's ringing.

160
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,951
It's not mine.

161
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,615
I wonder if it's ringing
inside someone's house?

162
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,557
Oh, that's probably it.

163
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,659
Anyway, I wonder what that kid
Sudoh was doing in a place like this?

164
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,498
He must've come here to see a friend...

165
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,265
The last place he used his credit card
was in that convenience store over there.

166
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,235
Buying cigarettes with a credit card...

167
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,471
Student life has certainly changed.

168
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,208
I guess you're right.

169
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,988
Excuse me, we're with the police.

170
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,614
Would you mind answering
a few questions?

171
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,036
It's dark...

172
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,404
It's so dark.

173
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:35,546
Oh, I see, so I died.

174
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:36,643
Hey.

175
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,315
Who are you?

176
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,514
I'm Shinji Sudoh.

177
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,645
I was murdered by your
mother, that's why I'm here.

178
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,287
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:46,687
Well, because...

180
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,620
Hey, don't feel bad, it's not
like I have a grudge or anything.

181
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,455
Wait a minute...

182
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,089
Did my mother breast-feed
you too, by any chance?

183
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,098
Yes.

184
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,931
Then you're like my brother, too!

185
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,528
What do you mean, then
there was someone else?

186
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,435
Yes.

187
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,030
What kind of person is he?

188
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:07,545
Well, I'm not really sure, but to
me he was a wonderful big brother.

189
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,638
Let me guess, you were in
love with him, weren't you?

190
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,108
Well, yes.

191
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,878
Then I hope he gets here soon.

192
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:18,150
Me, too, but that's a cruel
thing to hope for, isn't it?

193
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,315
That's true.

194
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:29,932
Hello?

195
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,962
Who is this?

196
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,440
Touji? It's you, isn't it?

197
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,940
I've missed you, Touji.

198
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,051
Nanny, I'm sorry, okay?

199
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,015
That's all right.

200
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:51,112
Marika's run away from home.
She might not be coming back.

201
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,153
But...

202
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,455
Now you and I can be alone,
just the two of us, forever!

203
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,104
I'm sorry, Nanny!

204
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,005
I'll never do it again,
so please forgive me.

205
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,111
No, that's the second
time you used that line.

206
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,440
But I swear, you're the
only woman I love, Nanny.

207
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,012
Then why don't you prove it to me?

208
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,084
Nanny, you're embarrassing me.

209
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,029
What's the matter, Touji?
You don't seem well today.

210
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,492
Nanny will make you feel better.

211
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,360
That feels good, Nanny.

212
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,669
Nanny...

213
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,645
I've only just started punishing you.

214
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,253
Delicious!

215
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,421
But we still have a long way to go...

216
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,462
This time you're going
to drink me, Touji.

217
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,538
Touji, keep sucking...

218
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,307
I'm starting to get
the shivers all over!

219
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,512
I want you to lick me until I melt away!

220
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,984
My God, what's happening? I feel
something shooting right through my
body!

221
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,534
Now I want you to lick
me right here, Touji.

222
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,536
Okay. I'll do anything for you, Nanny.

223
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,301
Yes!

224
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:59,543
Nanny, does that feel good?

225
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,280
That's it, right there.

226
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,152
Nanny's shy there, lick me harder!

227
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,456
I'll go even deeper for you, Nanny.

228
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,559
Yes!

229
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,426
Go on, stick out your behind more.

230
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,156
I'll lick you all the way from
your anus to your clitoris.

231
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,134
I'm coming!

232
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,984
The person you are trying to reach
is unable to come to the phone.

233
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:40,457
Please leave your name and
number within the next 30 seconds.

234
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,957
Marika... Where did you run off to?

235
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,341
That's my good-luck charm.

236
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,179
I want you to keep that with you, Touji.

237
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,630
Please leave a message
within the next 30 seconds.

238
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,292
It's Touji. Where the heck are you?

239
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,460
At least give me a call,
I'm so lonely without you...

240
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:42,543
Marika...

241
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,088
What are you doing here?

242
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,015
Nanny!

243
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,250
What are you doing here?

244
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,620
I was just wondering where Marika was...

245
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,595
Stop worrying about that girl,
she'll be back one of these days.

246
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,136
Yes, you're right.

247
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,229
We don't need to worry
about Marika, do we?

248
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,311
Nanny, it hurts! Please, stop!

249
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,882
Please, Nanny?

250
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,269
Touji, you mustn't hide
things from me!

251
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,862
I'm going to make sure you
can never call her again!

252
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,236
I'm sorry, Nanny!

253
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,643
I'll never do it again,
so please forgive me.

254
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,684
I thought you said I was
the only woman you loved!

255
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,386
After all the love I showered
on you, how could you betray me?

256
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,483
You're such a bad boy, Touji!

257
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,526
Nanny...

258
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,221
I'm suffering from this!

259
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,334
Touji, I'm so lonely!

260
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,937
Hurry up and suck it away!

261
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,170
Feels so good!

262
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,373
Touji, you're mine and
mine alone, aren't you?

263
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,475
Right. I don't love
anyone but you, Nanny.

264
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,076
There's no one but you.

265
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,018
That makes me so happy!

266
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,426
Touji...

267
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,325
Nanny.

268
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,267
Nanny, what are you doing?

269
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,236
Stop it, you're scaring me!

270
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,137
This is the problem right here.

271
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,938
This is what made you change from
that sweet boy you used to be.

272
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,477
Nanny, please!

273
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,480
But I have to. This is
a very important thing...

274
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,317
I haven't started punishing you yet.

275
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,054
Nanny, it hurts!

276
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,461
Nanny, it hurts! It's
going to fall off, stop!

277
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,638
It's going to fall off.

278
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,205
Nanny! Please, you've got to untie me!

279
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,309
Oh, no I won't.

280
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,142
You stay right here and think
about how bad you've been.

281
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,062
Touji...

282
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,131
Starting today, this will be the
only food you're going to get.

283
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,963
I'm going to pump out
lots and lots for you!

284
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,867
Now then, drink up.

285
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:55,274
What a good boy, my Touji.

286
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,143
Such a sweet boy.

287
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,313
Touji, sweetie...

288
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,952
Come on, suck it up!

289
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,246
Come on, suck my milk!

290
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,135
I can't hold back any longer.

291
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,936
Nanny, no, it hurts...

292
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,656
Nanny, it hurts...

293
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,533
Help me...

294
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,635
I want you come right now.

295
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,276
Ow, it hurts.

296
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,649
Now then, come!

297
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,263
Now don't be such a wimp!

298
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,010
I guess I have no choice.

299
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,515
All right, I'm going to
let you off easy today.

300
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,313
Come here.

301
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,231
Is he here?

302
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,323
Yes.

303
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,128
Marika! So you were here all along?

304
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,568
Yes. I've been waiting for you, Touji.

305
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,170
Isn't it strange?

306
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:16,577
Even though she treated me so cruelly,
I still never hated her, not once.

307
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,945
I know what you mean,
it was the same for me.

308
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,944
Oh, stop it, both of you.

309
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,681
I don't want to hear about my mother.

310
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,650
No, it's important
that we talk about this.

311
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:26,520
Right.

312
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,425
No matter how cruel she was to me, there
was still that feeling of absolute love...

313
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,929
I knew that she loved me.

314
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,065
That's why, even though I ended up
dead...

315
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,999
...I don't have any hard
feelings toward her at all.

316
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:45,637
That makes me bitter, but maybe
that's what absolute love really is...

317
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,171
But still I...

318
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,980
Yes?

319
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,150
Excuse me...

320
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,686
We're with the police.

321
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,116
You two are with the police?
Has something happened?

322
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:04,356
We're looking for this person,
do you know him, by any chance?

323
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,622
We know that he's been
in this neighborhood...

324
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,923
...but we don't know what's become of
him.

325
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,058
No, I have no idea.

326
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:11,965
I see...

327
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,367
Sorry I couldn't be of any help...

328
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,011
Mr. Shibuya, that pendant...

329
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,446
Right. There's no question.

330
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,382
Detectives?

331
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,248
Ma'am?

332
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,589
Oh, I'm glad you're here, there's
something we want to ask you.

333
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,628
What could that be?
