1
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,430
What happened to Brooks?

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,720
He involved Security Police,
but as we planned...

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,030
he was killed.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,600
And Massy's fallen into the trap?

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,930
Yes.

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,910
Well done, Dyne.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,810
Enjoy.

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,530
Good, so good.

9
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,050
Shadow is watched by the Security Police.

10
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,050
Be careful.

11
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,760
Yes.

12
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,130
Dr. Wezmar...

13
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,130
You said you hurt your arm.

14
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,800
Is it okay now?

15
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,370
Yes, I only had a minor damage
to my neuron system.

16
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,630
I see.

17
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,040
Were you worried about me?

18
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,080
You're under my care, after all.

19
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,110
I don't want to use you too harshly and
end up writing a damage report.

20
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,550
You have your maintenance
machines in the kitchen.

21
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,150
Yes?

22
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,690
Move them into the living room.

23
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,950
It clutters the kitchen too much.
Inconvenient.

24
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,550
Yes, sir!

25
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,830
Please, don't let me go home tonight.

26
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,330
But, you...

27
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,130
I love you. Please sleep with me.

28
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,170
But I have to...

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,640
I know, when the sun comes up,
you have to go away.

30
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:14,370
That's why I want to imprint
your memory inside me.

31
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,110
Approaching. A female.

32
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,480
Armed, confirmed!

33
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,890
You?

34
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,700
Metropolitan Police Department,
Security Task Force.

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,200
Lieutenant Mamoru Mikogami.

36
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,290
Confirmed.

37
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,140
Kaoru, your sister is here.

38
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,710
What's going on?

39
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,980
Who's this girl?

40
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,710
What are you doing here?

41
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,350
Right. I came to complain.

42
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,690
No! I came to ask
foran official explanation!

43
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,990
About the other day?

44
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,390
That was within my jurisdiction.

45
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,490
You're the one who breached
our operation...

46
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,630
based on a false information.

47
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,360
I've received no explanation!

48
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,460
You work for the Security Police.

49
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,940
You understand there are certain things
we just can't talk about.

50
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,340
You're always like that, Bro.

51
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,640
You suddenly left home.

52
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,980
Who knows when you started
this dangerous work.

53
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,120
Just like you, I'm a public servant.

54
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,920
But why did you have to disappear without
telling anybody? Why?

55
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,320
Couldn't you tell us why?

56
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,590
Yes. There was a reason...

57
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,630
why I joined the Imperial Intelligence.

58
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,990
That was...

59
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,660
Hey, Bro!

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,170
What? What did you say?

61
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,400
See, you aren't listening to me!

62
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,700
Ninth Heaven!
That's what I'm investigating.

63
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,510
Ninth Heaven?

64
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,780
Ninth Heaven?

65
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,210
It's a cyber drug popular
in the Subcultures.

66
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,780
The same one as we found in Brooks' room?

67
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,180
Yes. My analysis reveals it
was made of pure neuron units.

68
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,930
The same material used for Alice's brain.

69
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,430
It appears to be a system to send some data
directly into human brains.

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,470
Maintenance complete.

71
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,200
There's no abnormality
that will pose a problem.

72
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,870
What do you mean?

73
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,540
There are abnormalities,
but they aren't a problem?

74
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,270
Of course there are.

75
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,780
Girls are very complicated.

76
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,440
Mikogami, come in right now.

77
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,150
I'm wanted. See you later.

78
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,250
Alice, listen.

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,890
Yes?

80
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,760
Since the Brooks incident,
I see your emotions are not steady.

81
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,470
Yes, I am self-aware.

82
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,230
Is the unsteadiness caused
by Mr. Mikogami?

83
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,230
Well...

84
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,970
Strange.

85
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,740
I cannot control myself.

86
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,880
Really, you're just like a human.

87
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,910
Is this the way humans are? What can I do?

88
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,050
Be true to your heart.
Throw yourself at him.

89
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,520
Throw myself?

90
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,400
You mean, I have to attack Kaoru?

91
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,090
I cannot do such a thing!

92
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,110
Machine or human,
we have the same feelings.

93
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,010
Right?

94
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,450
Hey!

95
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,610
This is Steven Mayhew.
He was in charge of Alice, in the States.

96
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,990
In charge of Alice?

97
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,880
Are you CIA?

98
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,020
Massy Spector was...

99
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,990
the first guinea pig for MJP.

100
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,730
MJP?

101
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,130
A technology to directly connect
human brains and computers.

102
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,940
Was it all right?

103
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,170
You told the top secret to Mikogami.

104
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,570
We applied Alice Technology
to develop MJP.

105
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,350
I don't think Massy is aware
of this yet himself, but...

106
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,980
he's carrying the dormant
memories of Mayumi.

107
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,150
Mayumi...

108
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,360
For Mikogami's sake as well,
I was hoping nothing would happen.

109
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,320
Mikogami so far has no clue
to lead him to Massy.

110
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,760
I'm worried about Dyne Wiseman's
activities, too.

111
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,670
The question is...

112
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,940
why Digital Demand requested
Brooks' assassination.

113
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,910
This is interesting. But I do not like these.

114
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,040
I like...

115
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
What's wrong?

116
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,190
Behavioral malfunction now?

117
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,460
- Even for a joke...
- I like you, Kaoru.

118
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,000
I am happy that I got to meet you.

119
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,760
That I got to meet you is...

120
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,130
the best thing that's ever happened to me.

121
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,500
Again!

122
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,740
Red and purple.

123
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,950
Where's your money?

124
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,390
I caught them red-handed.
Mimura, come in now!

125
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,280
Mimura, what's wrong?

126
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,150
Do you copy?

127
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,100
That you came over here means...

128
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,240
You got something pretty heavy.

129
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,340
Ninth Heaven.

130
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,380
Know anything about it?

131
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,150
It's a chip with a stimulus program
to activate a human brain.

132
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,960
They are color-coded in nine colors,
and each has its own effect.

133
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,730
If you use one color too many times.

134
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,900
Or if you use it wrong...

135
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,930
it can cause the user's brain
to go into overdrive.

136
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,140
If you use the 9 colors in a certain
sequence in a certain time period...

137
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,710
it is said that you will gain
an absolute power.

138
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,440
Who says?

139
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,350
Nobody knows the said sequence
or the time period.

140
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,280
There are rumors, all wrong.

141
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,160
An urban legend, sort of.

142
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,390
I want to know the distribution route.

143
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,130
It's not the lmperial Intelligence work, is it?

144
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,230
It's sort of a dangerous investigation...

145
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,300
It's personal.

146
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,300
Whatever.

147
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,430
So long as you pay the fee.

148
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,570
How much?

149
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,380
You know.

150
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,120
With you only.

151
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,020
It's a barter.

152
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,750
Great, Kaoru. You're the best.

153
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,790
More. Give me more.

154
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,470
No, I'm coming.

155
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,190
They all come from a group
called the Shadows.

156
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,200
You can find their small fish easily.

157
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,300
Two dogs. Stupid.

158
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,600
But one of them is a girl.

159
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,210
We killed the guy.

160
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,740
The girl, we're keeping.

161
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,310
Not even a scratch.

162
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,110
Not even a scratch? Nice.

163
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,180
She's not talking much,
but she'll be a fun toy.

164
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,430
Who the hell are you?

165
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,690
You're a Shadow, aren't you?

166
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,270
Do you feel like telling me
where the girl is?

167
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,710
I'm not listening to you.

168
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,110
Then you don't need ears.

169
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,710
What else don't you need?

170
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,890
Eyes? Nose?

171
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,790
No!

172
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,320
Stop!

173
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,400
Let me go! Do you think you
can get away with this?

174
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,270
We can get away with anything.

175
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,010
You're a dog.

176
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,910
Now whimper. Cute.

177
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,520
Too bad, such a body is wasted
on the Security Police.

178
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,120
No, don't touch me!

179
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,720
Let's tame her, and make her our pet.

180
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,800
A pet without manners needs
harsh discipline.

181
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,500
What are you doing?

182
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,900
No!

183
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,900
Let me go, you perverted bastard!

184
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,410
Stop it!

185
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,720
Ouch.

186
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,510
What a pathetic bitch.

187
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,880
Twinkling around everywhere.

188
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,250
Only a dog would do that.

189
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,220
Bro.

190
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,620
No!

191
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,490
What else do you want?

192
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,870
Any discipline requires both
honey and thorns.

193
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,530
No.

194
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,540
Even Security Police girls have nice racks.

195
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,870
No, let me go.

196
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,240
It's disgusting.

197
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,550
Do you want it?

198
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,580
Who would want to be your...

199
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,290
I take it you're still a virgin.

200
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,890
No.

201
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,600
No!

202
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,730
No, no, no!

203
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,600
Didn't I tell you?

204
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,510
You're about to enjoy some sweet dreams.

205
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,370
No, no, don't look at me.

206
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,580
No, let me go.

207
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,080
Please.

208
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,160
No. Don't suck me there.

209
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,430
No.

210
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,700
You're driving me crazy.

211
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,950
I can't any more.

212
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,290
Something's happening.

213
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,170
First a leak, now a shower.

214
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,140
You really don't have any plugs,
don't you?

215
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,140
You need harsher discipline.

216
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,280
What? It's cold!

217
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,950
Don't put it in! No! Pull it out!

218
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,830
Pull it out! No!

219
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,640
It's coming in. It's coming in!

220
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,220
You're ripping my tummy!
You're ripping me!

221
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,390
The fun's just started.

222
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,600
You.

223
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,100
No.

224
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,520
It hurts. Hurts!

225
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,650
You're killing me.

226
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,140
Just kill me! Kill me!

227
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,340
I'll release it now.

228
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,100
No, don't pull it out.

229
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,540
I've joined the Security Police Attack Force.

230
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,840
You won't be the only one
making the world safe!

231
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,370
Mamoru...

232
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,320
Aren't you going under maintenance
at the Headquarters today?

233
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,960
I have confirmed multiple firearms
under your jacket.

234
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,090
- I order you to go back.
- I refuse.

235
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,160
What?

236
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,060
It's against the rules to act
on your own judgment.

237
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,240
Right, Mr. Mikogami?

238
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,100
Kanako!

239
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,580
I see you took the date from Alice.

240
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,150
But I have a personal business
to attend today.

241
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,680
Don't try to stop me.

242
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,660
I can pull the trigger faster than you
by 0.1003 second.

243
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,490
Why don't all three of us
break the rules together?

244
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,590
Thanks.

245
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,110
A Security Police bitch.
Who cares if she breaks?

246
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,430
Red and black. How about five each?

247
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,690
She won't be coming back anymore.

248
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,620
Help me, Bro!

249
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,060
What is it? Who is it?

250
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,400
Good evening.

251
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,820
Let's make it easy for Mr. Mikogami
to sneak in.

252
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,050
We have to make as big
a mess as possible.

253
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,060
Are you ready, Alice?

254
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,490
Here we go!

255
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,390
What?

256
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,390
This is a very expensive stuff. Enjoy it.

257
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,400
Finally, she's become an obedient pet.

258
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,930
Who the hell are you?

259
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,850
Alice!

260
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,050
This is it, girlie.

261
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,290
No, this is my favorite skirt!

262
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,190
You made it all dirty!

263
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,350
You'll pay for this!

264
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,900
Alice!

265
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,130
Are you all right?

266
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,970
I am fine. What about Kaoru?

267
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,910
Mamoru! Get a hold of yourself!

268
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,580
It's me. It's all right!

269
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,610
Mamoru.

270
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,720
Bro, help me.

271
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,120
Bro...

272
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,400
Mamoru!

273
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,760
Multiple bruises, abrasions, grazes...

274
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,800
perineum laceration, vaginal damage,
cervix injury.

275
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,380
But worst of all
her psyche is compromised by something.

276
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,250
Probably Ninth Heaven,
the new cyber drug going around...

277
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,140
I hear its real name is MJP.

278
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,150
MJP?

279
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,620
You have a new voice mail.
The Sender is Ayn.

280
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,360
Kiyoka, then.

281
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,920
Kaoru, I've got news related to the Shadows.

282
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,490
Bro.

283
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,270
Help me, Bro.

284
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,570
Help me, Bro...

285
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,810
Where is Alice?

286
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,710
It's Massy!
I finally figured out where he's gone to!

287
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,620
When Brooks died, he jumped to a nearby
neuron-type brain and possessed it.

288
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,510
Which is, Alice!

289
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,590
Massy is hiding inside Alice!

290
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,950
No way!

291
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,150
The Shadows are backed
by Dyne Wiseman...

292
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,600
the president of Digital Demand
Corporation.

293
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,570
I'll give you the details in person.

294
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,340
Kiyoka.

295
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,140
System error?

296
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,910
No.

297
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,320
Break in the current task.

298
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,620
Unable to control.

299
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,340
The other personality hiding inside Alice.

300
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,340
It turns out to be the final process
to create a new God.

301
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,320
Alice disappears,
and in order to bring her back...

302
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,510
Kaoru charges into the center
of the whole mystery.

303
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,350
"Necross."

304
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:24,820
Something is waking up quietly.
