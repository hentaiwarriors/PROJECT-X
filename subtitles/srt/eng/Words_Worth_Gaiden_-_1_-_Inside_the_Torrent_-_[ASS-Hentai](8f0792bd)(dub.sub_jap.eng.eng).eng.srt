1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:01,004
The I am the voice of God.

2
00:00:01,581 --> 00:00:06,678
The people of the world of Light
and Shadow, listen to my words...

3
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:11,551
I've created light as well as darkness,
but that's not the final state.

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,552
One day, you will finally get
to a complete state.

5
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:18,528
Before the day comes...

6
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:20,796
I have built it in steel.

7
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:24,137
This is the story of Persia and April.

8
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:26,728
They are the swordswomen
from the Race of Light.

9
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:28,838
Another adventure of light and shadow.

10
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:31,642
Full of love and courage.

11
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:36,707
WORDS WORTH

12
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:51,392
Norman, are you all right?

13
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,233
My shoulder seems to be hurt.

14
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:58,095
But it's no big deal, really.

15
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:02,934
If we win this war, April,
then I'll marry you.

16
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:06,612
I am so happy, Norman.

17
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:18,012
Damn!

18
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:19,180
Damn!

19
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:24,154
Those dudes from the Race of Light.
How can they do this on the battlefield?

20
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:26,563
I will go and get some water.

21
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:28,595
Please.

22
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:38,805
Damn, I must do this.
I must succeed. I will.

23
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:45,013
I am dying.

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,014
What?

25
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:51,317
April!

26
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:56,161
April!

27
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,107
I'm so bored.

28
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,338
I sure wish there was something
interesting going on here.

29
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:17,774
I think I heard someone's voice.

30
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:20,977
I guess it's around here somewhere.

31
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:23,253
Stop it!

32
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,584
Is it around here?

33
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:30,155
Yes, I definitely heard it!

34
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:31,660
A girl.

35
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:32,856
What it is?

36
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,466
No one's watching.

37
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:39,969
I'm going in.

38
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:58,751
Come on, Say it!
Say it quickly.

39
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:04,429
Wow, she's a cute girl.

40
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,129
Miss Sabrina!

41
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:16,106
Stop it! What do you want?

42
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,546
Here we go.

43
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,056
Stop it! Why are you doing this?

44
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,960
Say it! Say it quickly!

45
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:41,896
So what are you trying to
make me say anyway?

46
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:44,837
What should we ask?

47
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:48,736
Lets have a look, shall we!

48
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:50,571
What do you want me to do to anyway?

49
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:55,411
We want like Lord Stallion,
to have happy memories.

50
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:57,473
Or should I say mammaries?

51
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:01,719
It's good to have happy mammaries.
I mean memories.

52
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:05,916
How do I get this damn armor off?
It's bloody hell.

53
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:12,798
The one who caused this war
is your Race of Shadow.

54
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,933
We don't want to leave you in the dark.

55
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:21,070
Stop it!

56
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:26,303
Honestly, you just got to love
the perks of this job!

57
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:27,344
What?

58
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:29,677
Stop it!

59
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:35,710
That screaming!
That strong Miss Sabrina.

60
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:41,022
It's hard to imagine how she suffers
from that painful torture.

61
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:43,993
Miss Sabrina.

62
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:47,326
What an admirable girl she is!

63
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:50,661
There's a voice coming from there too.

64
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:53,297
There.

65
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,036
Stop!

66
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,635
Look! She's so wet.

67
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:02,841
I'd say from here that
her titties are pretty great.

68
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:09,821
You're torturing me!

69
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:14,082
I can't hold it any more!

70
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:17,186
I'm going to give you 50 lashes
with my tongue!

71
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,558
Titties!

72
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,824
So good!

73
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,901
Love those titties.

74
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,241
Save some for me.

75
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:36,506
I'm getting in now.

76
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,386
Come on, hurry up!

77
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,785
Yeah, really good.

78
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:47,218
It hurts!

79
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,270
Harder!

80
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:10,278
You suck! Too weak! Come on!

81
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,622
Harder! Push harder!

82
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:26,992
She isn't here.

83
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:31,500
Where did April go anyway?

84
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,074
There's the smell of blood, Gua!

85
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:43,338
Gua! That's the swordsman
of The Race of Light.

86
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:46,084
How come he is here?

87
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,551
Here goes!

88
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:54,592
I can't give up,
I have to find April.

89
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,428
I swear I'll find you.

90
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:08,133
What do you want?

91
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:11,132
I can tell you are the swordsman
from Race of Light.

92
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:12,740
So what?

93
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,846
I have more important matters
to tend to.

94
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,541
I don't have time to play
kid's game with you.

95
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:22,584
A kid's game? Why, I ought to...

96
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:33,097
Now who's playing around?

97
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:40,295
Want me to compete with a monster?
I don't have time.

98
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,874
You've got plenty of time.

99
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:46,674
What's your hurry, boy?

100
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,978
I spy a fly.

101
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,917
Wow! It's a woman. Yeah!

102
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:04,091
Norman?

103
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:13,270
That wasn't very nice!

104
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:15,933
You're a female swordsman
from the Race of Light.

105
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:17,007
So what?

106
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,041
What are you going to do about it?

107
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:22,940
I'll tell you,
I'm going to molest you good!

108
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,216
No! Stop!

109
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,920
Let me go!

110
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:33,714
No!

111
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:38,224
- Take a look at that.
- No!

112
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:49,567
She looks like...

113
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:51,869
She looks very satisfied.

114
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:54,143
It's impossible!

115
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:58,275
Because she had just been
cruelly tortured, by all these...

116
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:02,721
Just to save the immature me...

117
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:05,689
who almost got caught
by the cruel enemy.

118
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,524
Then...

119
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:11,619
No! Stay away from me!

120
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:16,429
You're the type of girl I like.

121
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:28,240
Where are you going to go now?

122
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,843
Get off, I can't breathe!

123
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:33,618
Get off!

124
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:38,554
This one hasn't got mature yet.
Not quite ripe and we like it.

125
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:40,520
It's painful!

126
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,053
No, help!

127
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:46,996
Stop!

128
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:49,631
Let me go!

129
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,794
Tastes like a virgin to me!

130
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:54,005
Let me go!

131
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,443
No, not there!

132
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:02,544
He's doing it one more time.

133
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,882
But this Stallion dude,
in a wartime like this...

134
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:07,919
he can still take that so easy,
I really admire him.

135
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:16,495
Is there anyone much stronger here?

136
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:19,994
Persia!

137
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:23,828
Help me. No! Stop!

138
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:26,537
Persia!

139
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,537
Hey! Leave her alone!
You asshole horse!

140
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:34,006
Your words arouse me,
come and get it baby!

141
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:36,438
Miss Sabrina!

142
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:40,049
Look at me!

143
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:47,756
Yeah, baby.

144
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:50,226
The scent of a woman.

145
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:51,953
All right! I'm coming!

146
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:58,863
- You ignorant guy!
- Miss Sabrina, no!

147
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:12,878
Persia. Are you okay?

148
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:14,314
Thank goodness!

149
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:17,313
Persia!

150
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,718
Miss Sabrina!

151
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:25,394
Stop! Stop it!

152
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:29,395
Allow me to keep you
abreast of the situation.

153
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:35,134
Have you ever heard of toad in the hole?

154
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:36,434
Yeah, baby!

155
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,976
No one would want to marry me!

156
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:41,772
How about this?

157
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:43,012
What?

158
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:45,748
No! Stop it!

159
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:47,918
No!

160
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:49,543
Stop!

161
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:51,683
Please, no!

162
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,893
Norman! Help me!

163
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,996
Simmer down.

164
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:00,256
No!

165
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,192
You're getting wet.

166
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:10,132
So why do you think you'd be caught
by that kind of an enemy?

167
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:11,836
I'm sorry!

168
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:13,605
For that kind of thing.

169
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:16,577
For being a swordsman in our Ray of Light.

170
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:18,377
Even for just being women.

171
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:21,718
If we get frustrated
with being a swordsman...

172
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:23,654
we have to overcome it.

173
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:25,054
It hurts!

174
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:29,758
Only this level,
no need to scream so loud.

175
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:34,494
This is called the love
of teacher and student, right?

176
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:38,532
Or perhaps my dear,
there is a deeper reason?

177
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:42,071
What do you want,
you peeping freakazoid?

178
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,707
I've come here for the little girl.

179
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:51,541
Stallion likes mature women,
But he prefers the little ones better.

180
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,784
My God, you're a stupid asshole!

181
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:04,063
Don't stare at me with such a terrible face!

182
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,627
- Shut up!
- My bones are breaking apart!

183
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:09,099
Come on girl, let's escape now!

184
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:10,903
Yes!

185
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:12,968
Wow! That's so cool!

186
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:16,941
Yeah, getting froggy with it.

187
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:18,840
I can't take it any more!

188
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:20,879
You'll want me to do it to you again!

189
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:23,972
It feels so strange.

190
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,644
But it's a good strange.

191
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:36,023
It's the first time I feel it this way!

192
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,021
- I'll bet.
- I can't take it any more.

193
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,255
It feels so good!

194
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:47,502
No!

195
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,732
So good!

196
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:52,035
So good!

197
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,079
No!

198
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:58,676
Norman!

199
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,888
Who am I going to
horse around with today?

200
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,331
What?

201
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:19,431
Stallion, you're just in time.

202
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:21,972
I've got a splitting headache.

203
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:25,804
You stupid bone head!
How can you let them escape?

204
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:27,607
Quickly.

205
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:29,470
Yes!

206
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:54,068
I've got to climb up there, anyway.

207
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:59,870
But will Norman take me,
after my body has been tortured like that?

208
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:07,580
So, all is going well.

209
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,184
Obviously, it's because human beings
are a warlike race.

210
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,498
Why would Swordsman from the
Race of Light would come here?

211
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,235
I'm unsure as to whether
she heard us or not.

212
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,171
I don't know, either.
But the war is so serious.

213
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:36,613
It's only a step to let them
destroy each other...

214
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:39,708
we've got to be very careful,
It's a bit tricky.

215
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:42,585
Being a staff officer
in the Race of Light...

216
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:45,418
I'm not sure it's appropriate
for me to be here.

217
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:47,786
I will leave the rest up to you.

218
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,658
Miss, How do you feel?

219
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:56,461
Another monster!

220
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:00,467
Won't let you go!

221
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:13,318
What a tough guy to deal with!

222
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,817
Wait! My engines revving, baby.

223
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:18,287
Want to feel some horse power?

224
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:22,893
This way!

225
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,638
Looks like he got the same brain
like a horse or a donkey.

226
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:40,402
If we both run away together
it would be too easy to be seen.

227
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,845
They can see me first okay.

228
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,241
Understand me?

229
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,311
Good girl!

230
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,064
Two swordswomen and a horse head
man are out there.

231
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:04,360
Has anyone seen them?

232
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:05,802
No, I haven't seen them.

233
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:08,431
I didn't see anyone.

234
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:16,310
If you did, then you should leave them alone.

235
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:18,883
You want to try some new stuff?

236
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,949
New stuff?
What are you talking about?

237
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:28,022
That means the two of us.

238
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:33,459
Wow!

239
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:35,763
What?

240
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,232
You bad thing!

241
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:40,264
You make us act crazy like this.

242
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:45,742
You bad thing!

243
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:53,909
Hey, what are you...

244
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:57,987
Haven't touched a good guy like this
for a long time.

245
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:00,388
Feeling horny, honey?

246
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:06,229
Hey, where did that saucy little virgin go?

247
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:08,024
Don't they like to ride ponies?

248
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:12,793
No!

249
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:16,775
Yeah, that one's really my type.

250
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:18,373
No.

251
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:22,403
No!

252
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:27,108
No.

253
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,685
No.

254
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:34,587
No, it's the Stallion. This is trouble!

255
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:38,756
Well, hello dolly!

256
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:40,395
No!

257
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:47,130
After the frog and the snake.
Here comes the horse monster!

258
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:50,240
If you hadn't have said that I was going
to be more tender to you.

259
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:55,914
No! I don't want it!

260
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,610
What kind of country is this?

261
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:00,611
No!

262
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:04,345
There are creatures in this place as well.

263
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:08,160
If you had more space,
your life would be better.

264
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:13,396
It's true!
On that side around the bog.

265
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:22,306
That's really a shame.

266
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:24,403
No!

267
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:26,067
No! Stop!

268
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:29,772
How dare you deny the Stallion.

269
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:32,679
Now I'm going to graze your pasture.

270
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:38,589
No!

271
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:44,390
Stop! Stop!

272
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,057
Yeah?

273
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:54,638
You're resistance is futile,
your just making me more horny.

274
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:57,373
No!

275
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:07,180
Pretty little titties.

276
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:13,056
How come all these monsters...

277
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:19,257
No!

278
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:25,864
It becomes so strange down there.

279
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:35,603
Nobody is ever going to marry me now.

280
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:37,805
Norman! Norman!

281
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,348
I'm sorry, Norman!

282
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,019
Feels so good!

283
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:47,787
It feels so good.

284
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:50,689
No, stop. Stop it!

285
00:20:56,535 --> 00:21:01,632
Please, it feel so good!
Push harder.

286
00:21:01,774 --> 00:21:03,742
Harder. Push.

287
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:07,973
I'm coming!

288
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:10,481
Are you feeling all right?

289
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,812
Cheer up!

290
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:19,454
It's all right!

291
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,592
I thought you were going to die.

292
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:24,222
This is...

293
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,893
It's not a big deal.

294
00:21:30,903 --> 00:21:33,394
You were that girl, thank you.

295
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:40,201
Because of you, I feel so much better.

296
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:44,806
Are you leaving?

297
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,848
Yes!

298
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:48,513
You are the swordsman
from the Race of Light.

299
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:50,585
And I am from the Race of Shadow.

300
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:52,617
Please don't say so.

301
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:54,889
I don't know what to do, either.

302
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:56,921
You are so tender.

303
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:58,992
My name is Esterla.

304
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:00,731
What's yours?

305
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,900
Mr. Esterla.

306
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:06,294
My name is Persia.

307
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:07,871
Persia, you say?

308
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:22,545
What are you doing, Persia?

309
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,288
Miss Sabrina?

310
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,793
The sister on the wooden horse.

311
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:32,996
What?

312
00:22:33,632 --> 00:22:35,930
He is from the Race of Shadow, right?

313
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:37,031
He was hurt.

314
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:39,366
Don't feel sorry for our enemy!

315
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:49,243
Drop dead, you Race of Shadow!
