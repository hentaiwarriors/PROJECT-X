1
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:06,240
Hyde, I want you.

2
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,471
But what about your injury?

3
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:09,913
I'm fine.

4
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:12,947
I want you to make me forget everything.

5
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:27,029
Hyde, that feels good.

6
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:28,958
Yes!

7
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:21,217
Yes!

8
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:25,747
Wait!

9
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:46,839
No, wait.

10
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,783
Hyde!

11
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:14,137
No!

12
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:40,657
Yes, Hyde, Hyde!

13
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:44,502
Wait, wait Hyde!

14
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:49,766
I'm going to...

15
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:53,742
Hyde!

16
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,615
Hyde, Hyde!

17
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,149
I'm coming.

18
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:10,059
Hyde, I'm going...

19
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:12,061
Yeah, me too!

20
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:13,655
Hyde I'm coming!

21
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:46,323
Teres.

22
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:50,802
Hyde, thank you.

23
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:27,731
Thank you.

24
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:29,338
I'm sorry.

25
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,077
Goodbye.

26
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:50,761
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:52,829
I'm sorry!

28
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:56,357
I'm really sorry!

29
00:05:56,836 --> 00:06:01,239
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

30
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,241
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:11,115
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

32
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:14,742
I'm sorry!

33
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:17,955
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:19,321
It's not your fault.

35
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:20,324
I'm sorry.

36
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,461
This earthquake might have
something to do with Youra.

37
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:09,667
Youra, where did you go!

38
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:24,749
Shit, I think here is something
going on with the legacy.

39
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:27,948
Slain! It has to be him!

40
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:29,781
He's probably up to no good.

41
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:32,523
Youra, where in the world are you?

42
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:36,023
Youra, Youra!

43
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,372
What the...

44
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:19,570
Dearest Hyde, you came here after all.

45
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:23,639
Youra!

46
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:26,175
Youra, where, where are you?

47
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:27,440
Listen to me.

48
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,012
I'm going to stop Castor's ability
to move for a short while.

49
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:35,086
Please kill him while I do this!

50
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:37,985
Are you talking about this monster?

51
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:41,986
But what will happen to you?

52
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:44,527
Hyde, we don't have a lot of time.

53
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:54,099
This is what you, Slain, and countless
others have been looking for.

54
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:57,133
It is the "legacy of the old world."

55
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:59,308
This is it?

56
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:00,578
This thing?

57
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:03,178
He's one of Youra's kind.

58
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:04,347
Youra?

59
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,048
And this monster?

60
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:07,348
That's right.

61
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:10,714
It's not like I know that much.

62
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:15,083
The royal library has a lot of information.

63
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:18,128
So, you're from the capital?

64
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:25,069
The power of the spirit is distributed
between this thing, Youra, and the amulet.

65
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,442
There may be more of these giants.

66
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:35,541
This may be the only one,
or there could be many others.

67
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:39,183
All we know is these giants
destroyed the old world.

68
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:44,018
And now, I'm sure it could destroy
our country, no, our world again.

69
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:46,852
Wait, what about Youra?

70
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:49,618
If we have Youra and the amulet,
we can at least...

71
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:52,287
keep him contained
even if we can't destroy him.

72
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,359
So, I see Slain was the one that helped
awaken this beast.

73
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:58,834
That's only part of it.

74
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,796
Youra awakened first, thanks to you.

75
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:03,936
So this is my fault?

76
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:13,009
We have to act now,
he's starting to open his eyes!

77
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,652
What can I do?

78
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:24,795
I can't tell you.

79
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:27,499
All I know is you need that amulet.

80
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:30,331
If you can't figure it out, I will.

81
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:31,999
Give me the amulet.

82
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:39,539
Youra.

83
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:41,044
Please Hyde!

84
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:46,683
Hyde, I'm going to stop Castor's ability
to move for a short while, so...

85
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:47,910
Youra!

86
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,420
There is no escape from this?

87
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,189
I have to kill him.

88
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:57,661
Damn!

89
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:08,557
We need to get out of here.

90
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:10,534
Youra!

91
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,227
Youra!

92
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:15,707
Where are you, Youra?

93
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,017
Youra!

94
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:30,985
Youra!

95
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:32,421
Hyde.

96
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:35,957
I thought I heard someone was calling me.

97
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:39,687
I was trying to figure out who,
when I saw this light...

98
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:51,340
Damn, it's not working.

99
00:13:57,783 --> 00:13:59,307
Youra, what's wrong?

100
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:01,777
The power of the spirit.

101
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:03,521
Power of the spirit?

102
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:05,719
Yes, it's becoming unstable.

103
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:06,859
At this rate...

104
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:08,757
Youra?

105
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:10,089
Hyde.

106
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:13,422
I'm sorry, but I can't come with you.

107
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,395
What are you talking about?

108
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:18,503
The spirit is becoming unstable
because it used to be...

109
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:22,735
contained within Castor's body,
but now it's free.

110
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:27,006
Without a body to contain it,
the spirit is running wild!

111
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:31,282
It becomes pure energy
when it is not contained.

112
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:33,083
Soon, here...

113
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:36,355
actually, not just here,
everything will be destroyed.

114
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,319
That's why we need to get out of here fast!

115
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:42,423
That's not it, even if we escape this cave...

116
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,295
the city of Arville...

117
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:47,089
She means the whole world
is going bye-bye.

118
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:51,367
This can't be true!

119
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:53,371
What are we going to do?

120
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:55,801
I am the only one to stop it.

121
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:58,102
But why you, Youra?

122
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:02,313
Castor and I are the only ones
that can stop this.

123
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:05,613
Wait Youra, this is going to kill you!

124
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:10,415
If I don't stop the spirit,
everything will be destroyed.

125
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:14,159
Everyone I cared about.

126
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:22,557
I'm sorry about how I behaved a while back.

127
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:27,773
Well, I'm sure being told you're not human
was a shock to you.

128
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:30,872
Yes, but I'm okay now.

129
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:34,473
I'm feeling much better.

130
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:52,890
Are you okay?

131
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:54,664
Yes.

132
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:09,376
Answer me if you can.

133
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:10,115
Yes?

134
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,714
Are your memories coming back?

135
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:16,979
Yes, they are.

136
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:31,065
I'm really grateful to you, Hyde.

137
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,137
Grateful, to me?

138
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:33,328
Yes.

139
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,574
I really wanted to thank you.

140
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:37,472
It's no big deal.

141
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,236
It was you, Hyde,
that awakened me...

142
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:44,943
and also the one that saved me
from that man.

143
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,084
It's no big deal, really.

144
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:51,149
You always saved me when I thought
I was done for.

145
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:53,091
And I'm truly grateful.

146
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:53,815
Youra...

147
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,256
I'm sitting here with you because
you saved my life.

148
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:01,459
It's a wonderful feeling.

149
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:03,095
About my fate...

150
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:08,069
I met you, Hyde, and also Sakura,
Ms. Shizuki, Maria.

151
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,205
Everyone helped me so much.

152
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:15,436
Everyone was so kind,
although I was a complete stranger.

153
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:18,550
You should just relax and enjoy yourself.

154
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:22,119
Everyone wants to help you,
because they really like you.

155
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:23,721
Myself included.

156
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:25,688
I like everyone, too.

157
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:29,124
Well, that's the most important thing, right?

158
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:32,187
Yes, thank you.

159
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:34,058
Thank you very much, Hyde.

160
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:38,660
You've done just so much for me.

161
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,406
I don't know what I would have done.

162
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:50,648
I want this moment to last.

163
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,011
Yeah.

164
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,499
Hyde, I'm really nervous.

165
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:13,504
But it feels really good.

166
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:16,770
I've never felt like this before.

167
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:19,201
I see.

168
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:21,637
This will feel even better.

169
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:22,811
Yes.

170
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:39,629
Your body is so beautiful.

171
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,590
Hyde, I want you!

172
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:41,520
I like it!

173
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:50,363
Now, touch me down there.

174
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:53,336
Like this?

175
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:53,937
Yes.

176
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:58,273
Hyde, it's so hard and warm.

177
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:00,378
You're probably all warm here, too.

178
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:07,979
Just insert it very slowly.

179
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:09,113
Yes.

180
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,658
It's warm.

181
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:18,290
Does it hurt?

182
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:19,656
No.

183
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:21,965
See, now we are joined together.

184
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:25,098
Yes, I'm joined together with you.

185
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:31,065
Hyde, I can feel you pulsing
gently inside me.

186
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,838
It's because I really like you.

187
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:35,435
I'm so happy.

188
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:36,509
Me too.

189
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:39,917
I love you a lot, Hyde.

190
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:41,850
I love you a lot too, Youra.

191
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:44,888
What's funny?

192
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:45,714
Nothing.

193
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:50,257
I'm just getting embarrassed, that's all.

194
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:56,026
I want more of you Hyde.

195
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:58,231
Do what you like.

196
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:13,513
Yes!

197
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:16,045
Yes!

198
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:19,724
I'm sorry, are you okay?

199
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,253
No, I'm fine.

200
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:24,826
I'm just not used to this.

201
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:28,931
I felt tingles all over my body
when you moved like that.

202
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:30,467
Did you like it?

203
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:31,592
Yes.

204
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:32,765
All right!

205
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:29,989
Yes!

206
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:34,460
I think I'm going to come!

207
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,168
I think I'm coming, too.

208
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:39,165
Yes!

209
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:46,075
Youra!

210
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,392
Hyde, I feel so warm.

211
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:04,688
Especially my stomach.

212
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:06,364
Yeah.

213
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:07,796
I'm very happy.

214
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:30,012
No, I can't let you do that!

215
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,252
You're not going to be the martyr!

216
00:23:37,863 --> 00:23:41,424
I was here in this cave so I could meet you.

217
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:44,801
Goodbye, Hyde.

218
00:26:40,812 --> 00:26:42,905
Later!

219
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:46,709
See you, bye!

220
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:54,682
Hyde!

221
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,959
Did you call me?

222
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:06,137
Shit, you know, it's not what you think
and it's a really long story.

223
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:07,671
It's a really complicated story.

224
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,831
I swear nothing went on in there,
so why are you looking all pissed off?

225
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:14,003
I mean I'm really innocent
of all wrongdoing.

226
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:19,108
Why does this happen to me?

227
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:23,254
Hyde, you're always just playing around
all the damned time!

228
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:25,448
Well, it' not...

229
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:29,820
Hyde, where do you think you're going,
come back, you bastard!

230
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:32,794
Hi Manaty, what's up?

231
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:34,330
See you later!

232
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,399
Slow down Hyde!

233
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:43,566
Wait, damn it!

234
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:45,766
No way!

235
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:51,575
Hyde!

236
00:27:57,756 --> 00:28:01,988
Hi there! You two are looking awfully good
on this fine day!

237
00:28:02,094 --> 00:28:04,062
See you later!

238
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,122
Wait up, you lazy bum, Hyde!

239
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:13,368
I think I'm going to stay and enjoy
Arville for a little longer...

240
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:18,372
before I go hunting for the next treasure...

241
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:20,873
probably with Sakura.

242
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:22,641
Hyde!
