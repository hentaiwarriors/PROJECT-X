1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,190
The burgeoning metropolis
of Tokyo...

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,560
Of those who lurk in the
dark underbelly of this city...

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,790
...some cower in the
darkness itself...

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,130
...while others seek pleasure
to escape the darkness.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,510
This man may very well have been
a victim of the forces of darkness.

6
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,440
ln response to such unusual cases,
Police Chief Kanzaki had...

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,710
...gathered up a group of people
with unusual abilities.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,420
A man who regularly
risks his life in movie stunts...

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,120
...in order to forget his past...

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,060
...Koji Yamada is a
member of that team.

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,700
This loner of a man found some
happiness in his friendly relations...

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,830
...with a female neighbor
and her son.

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,540
Koji was chosen as partner to Jun
who has the clairvoyant ability...

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,550
...to see the last moments of a victim's
life as she climaxes during sex.

15
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,540
The sex was supposed to be
loveless and dry...

16
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,610
...but Jun was mysteriously
aroused and...

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,520
...had become
emotionally drawn to Koji.

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,820
However...

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,220
...the anguished soul of Koji...

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,750
...who had taken the life of a
former lover with his own hands...

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,450
...was closed and unyielding.

22
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,820
Meanwhile, from the visions
as seen by Jun...

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,190
lt was clearly determined that...

24
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,860
...the perpetrator of the multiple
murders was not human.

25
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,460
But there were no further leads.

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,330
Also, their leader, Chief Kanzaki
had been monitoring the lives...

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,500
...of the team members
for some unknown reason.

28
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,680
Then there's the mysterious entity
that oversees the murder...

29
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,650
...and Kotani, the man
which the entity possesses.

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,650
As Koji seeks to get to the
root of the first murder incident...

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,750
...a second murder had taken place.

32
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,920
The perpetrator that
appeared before Koji...

33
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,150
...was a savage and evil monster.

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,290
At the end of the battle...

35
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,230
...the monster had
disappeared without a trace.

36
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,190
The sex murder investigation
team on the trail of the monster...

37
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,300
...was able to use Jun's abilities
to discover a suspicious old man.

38
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,540
Meanwhile, Kyoko Tamachi, who
has left for town with her son...

39
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,100
...was met by a groping pervert
on the subway.

40
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,740
She was not able to control her thirst.

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,380
Following the old man, the team
was led to a subway station...

42
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,150
...where they came upon a
sexually enslaved Kyoko Tamachi...

43
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,690
...and her son Yuta.

44
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,850
As Koji and team stood
in blank astonishment.

45
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,230
...the monster appeared once again...

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,960
...this time reducing the
subway station to a killing field.

47
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,970
That bastard!

48
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,880
This time it won't be like the last.

49
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,250
Koji!

50
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,140
That bastard!

51
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,750
Koji!

52
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
Koji...

53
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,630
Koji... Koji...!

54
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,160
Please stop this. lt's a massacre.

55
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,470
Quite a show, huh? Humans
seem to like to hurt each other.

56
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,810
But you started it all.

57
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,040
Shut up!

58
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,750
A pathetic old man like
you shouldn't be complaining.

59
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,520
Koji...

60
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,390
Don't die, Koji!

61
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,400
l've never seen a
case like this before.

62
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,130
A very powerful toxin is being
released from that object in his arm.

63
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,100
The toxin is in the process of
spreading at the cellular level.

64
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,080
We will have to amputate
his arm immediately...

65
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,240
...or his life will be in danger.

66
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,740
Amputation?

67
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,610
Yes.

68
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,580
There's no other way.

69
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,680
l'm sure he'd give up
an arm to save his life.

70
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,720
l don't understand how he's
keeping himself alive so far.

71
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,960
And l don't know...

72
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,330
...how effectively surgery will
prevent the toxin from spreading.

73
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,970
Does that mean he's going to die?

74
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,930
He could go either way.

75
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,660
ln other words, we can only hope
that he's got a strong life force.

76
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,370
He was the first man who was
able to give me an orgasm.

77
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,880
Koji...

78
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:24,350
You're the man who could remind
me of what it means to be alive.

79
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,820
So...

80
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,550
So, please don't die.

81
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,460
l don't want you to die.

82
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,740
Koji...

83
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,160
Koji... Koji...!

84
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,200
Koji, we came together.

85
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,340
l'm alive, Koji...

86
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,580
l'm alive...

87
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,140
Chief, lnspector Shibuya is here to see you.

88
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,020
What is this?

89
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,450
l can't accept it.

90
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,190
l don't think l can handle my
responsibilities given the situation.

91
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,630
You are doing a great job.

92
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,960
lt's awfully inconvenient when
you can't make any moves...

93
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
...until a monster appears.

94
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,470
We've picked up one suspicious man...

95
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,240
...and we're hoping that
he will give us a lead.

96
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,580
Right. Well,
l'm counting on you.

97
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,210
l can't accept this letter.
l need you on my team.

98
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,910
Y-Yes, sir!

99
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,040
Now, get back to work.

100
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,910
Excuse me.

101
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,800
Chief, why would you let a
man like that off with his pride?

102
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,610
lt's not pride. That position is
perfect for a lowly man like him.

103
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,210
lt would be inconvenient
if he had any sort of ambition.

104
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,920
This guy's useless.

105
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,520
l think he just lost his mind after
seeing that monster.

106
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,770
Thank god.

107
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,600
l thought for sure that
you were going to die.

108
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,170
Don't be stupid.
You think l'd die so easily?

109
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,150
You were in a coma for five days.

110
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,180
Even l was worried.

111
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,810
Five days, huh?

112
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,720
You'll get used to it after a while.

113
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,220
Yeah, l suppose l'll manage.

114
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,830
The amputated arm has been
properly preserved.

115
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,760
With some further research,
we might re-attach it one day.

116
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,600
l won't get my hopes up.

117
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,580
Where's Jun?

118
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,550
Actually, l haven't seen her.

119
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,140
l guess she's just a
heartless woman in the end.

120
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,930
After that incident...

121
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,310
...l thought that happiness
would never come to me.

122
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,450
Brother!

123
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,160
No... no...!

124
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,930
No!

125
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,600
l'll show you!

126
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,280
Mother...! Sister...!

127
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,160
Mother!

128
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,260
Mother! Mother!

129
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,000
No! Ow, ow...! lt hurts!

130
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,260
lt hurts! No!

131
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,630
Oh, yeah! Nice and tight!

132
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,100
That's good...!
Yeah, make it tighter!

133
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,240
Make it tighter!

134
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,050
Yeah! Yeah!

135
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,930
Hey, it's about time we got outta here.

136
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,700
That's too bad.

137
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,340
l was supposed to have been killed.

138
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,010
But for some reason...

139
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,540
...l couldn't go where my
mother and father had gone.

140
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,220
But, Mother, Father...

141
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,230
An important person in my life has
returned from the edge of death.

142
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,200
l've never thought l'd be as happy
as this day since that time.

143
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,740
You're here.

144
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,750
Yes.

145
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,680
The flowers were wilted.

146
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,190
l'm out soon. Why bother?

147
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,230
Not yet though.
l don't think you realize it...

148
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,160
...but you were pretty much dead.

149
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,700
l don't think there're any more concerns.

150
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,870
Here. l'm returning this to you.

151
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,840
Did you have a vision?

152
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,570
Well?

153
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,280
You know, Koji...

154
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,720
l think you should forget about
that woman you call Yuki.

155
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,920
l feel that you'll become
unhappy chasing after her.

156
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,120
Jun...!

157
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,460
Anyway, it looks like the monster
problem has subsided...

158
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,870
...so you should take advantage
of the time you have off.

159
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,730
Otherwise...

160
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,740
Stop fucking with me.

161
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,240
Say it.

162
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,040
l don't have anything to say.

163
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,940
Say it!

164
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,250
Jun...

165
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,750
Do you know why
l was inclined to join our team?

166
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,950
lt was so l could search for Yuki.

167
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,820
Why? Yuki's...

168
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,430
The one who told me Yuki was dead was...

169
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,030
...Kanzaki.

170
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,570
l never saw her remains.

171
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,510
That's why l can't
truly believe that she's dead.

172
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,150
Kanzaki knows something.

173
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,690
l figured that if l stay near him,
l might come across a clue.

174
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,290
l see.

175
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,830
But l'm being honest when l say
l don't know anything.

176
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,720
l see...

177
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,450
l'm a 28-year-old housewife.
l have plenty of time on my hands.

178
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,760
lf you are looking for casual sex,
give me a call.

179
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,190
Multiple partners are okay too.

180
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,940
We're pretty lucky,
finding a woman like this.

181
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,540
lt's gonna be a major league fuck fest!

182
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,880
And she's got a pretty damn good body too.

183
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,490
l wasn't like this before.

184
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,760
You liar.

185
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,960
A woman like you could only
be a nympho from birth.

186
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,870
But it's true.

187
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,770
Please, put it in here.

188
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,420
lt's all because of that man.

189
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,020
He's the one who turned me
into a woman like this.

190
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,030
Stop! Please stop!

191
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,760
That hurts! No!

192
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,660
Stop it! Yuta will wake up!

193
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,000
Your son isn't going to wake up this late.

194
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,670
Please, stop...!

195
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,220
You just have to obey what l say.

196
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,140
That man is now dead.

197
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,720
He died at the hands of his own father.

198
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,090
l despised my husband.

199
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,960
There's no doubt he's the one
who lured me to this world.

200
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,600
Just as he once told me, l should
be thanking him for this.

201
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,730
Oh, l can't escape from this pleasure...

202
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,390
This is getting really bad.

203
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,770
Since the only people who're
getting killed are men...

204
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,860
...l feel we should just
leave them to themselves.

205
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,170
Stop spouting that nonsense
and get back to work.

206
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,330
All right...

207
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,950
What's the matter, Koji?

208
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,180
Yuta!

209
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,990
Yuta! A stretcher! Get a stretcher!

210
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,690
Who's that?

211
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,920
Looks like a young man.

212
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,390
l don't see any wounds, but be careful.

213
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,230
Yes.

214
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,510
That old man?

215
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,580
What are you talking about?

216
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,880
All right. l'll be there soon.

217
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,880
Let me go! Let me see my Yuta!

218
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,420
How did you know that
your grandson was here?

219
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,760
Yuta...! Yuta...!

220
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,530
ln the subway incident, that old
man was at the station Yuta was at.

221
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,300
You think he can read
his grandson's movements?

222
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:39,010
Yuta! Yuta...! Yutaaa...!

223
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,370
Yuta!

224
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,780
They'll find us out.

225
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,310
Don't' worry. Nobody can see us.

226
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,060
We've gotta go deal with the son.

227
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,150
Well, let's go see what's
going on, and then just go home.

228
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,050
All right?

229
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,860
You're the one who found this son.

230
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,090
l think you could show a
little more concern for him.

231
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,490
You're awake.

232
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,460
Where's my Mother?

233
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,630
Huh?! Well...

234
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,840
Your mother's gone far away for work.

235
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,850
She'll be back soon, so let's do
our best to manage on our own.

236
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,650
lf you have any problems, you can
always come to me, all right?

237
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,390
Well, how's Yuta?

238
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,690
No change.

239
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,000
You said you know him from before?

240
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,970
He lives in my neighborhood.

241
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,530
l don't understand how a mother
could just leave her son like that.

242
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,600
She didn't seem to be that
type of woman to me.

243
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,110
ls she beautiful?

244
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,840
She seemed very sweet.

245
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,870
Mo-mo-mo, Mother!

246
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,110
What's the matter, old man?

247
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,020
Koji...

248
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,450
Damn...!

249
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,390
What the hell...?!

250
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,920
Yuta!

251
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,330
Yuta!

252
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,190
Koji!

253
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,160
What is it?

254
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,370
Was that young man really the monster?

255
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,640
Looks that way.

256
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,800
Hurry up! Or we're gonna lose him!

257
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,210
Don't worry.

258
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,410
As long as we've got the old man
here, we'll know where he went.

259
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,320
He's headed for his mother's.

260
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,090
l can't imagine where else
he'd want to go.

261
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,220
His mother's?

262
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,190
You see, l'm here to protect my mother.

263
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,920
l get it.

264
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,130
This is how the son
protects his mother from danger.

265
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,440
Your cock stinks a bit.

266
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,850
So you say. But you sure seem
to be getting off from sucking it.

267
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,450
The smell of smegma is strong.

268
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,390
l'm sucking on a filthy thing.

269
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,590
l'm so hot inside,
l'm just dripping all over.

270
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,890
Hey, lady. Are you for real?

271
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,300
You must be insane.

272
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:03,170
Let's see that hot pussy of yours.
Let's have a look.

273
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,040
Let's see...

274
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,980
Looks like you sure get around.

275
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,070
You must be a real pro.

276
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,410
Ever taken a look at your own pussy?

277
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,920
Your pussy lips are all black.

278
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,380
That's such a terrible thing to say...

279
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,480
l...l can't take it anymore.
Please, hurry...!

280
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,610
Hurry...!

281
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,250
l've never fucked a woman
this dirty before!

282
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,290
Hurry, l want your...

283
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,930
...big cock...!

284
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,460
lt's right in!

285
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,140
This big cock is getting shoved into me!

286
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,010
Wh-What a find she is!

287
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,640
lt's so damn good to fuck the
brains out of a total slut!

288
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,250
Shove it in nice and deep!

289
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,420
lt's so deep! lt's so deep!

290
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,350
M-My clit...!

291
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,860
lt feels so good!

292
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,190
l'm gonna cum...
l'm gonna cum...!

293
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,900
Sh-She's cumming!

294
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,810
Mother!

295
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,710
Wh-Who's that?!

296
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,910
Mother...

297
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,760
Christ. What the hell are you
bringing your son around for?

298
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,230
Cramps my style.

299
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,700
Mother...

300
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,730
Yuta!

301
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,840
Why are you in a place like this?!

302
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,180
Why? Well, that's 'cuz l'm here
to protect my Mother.

303
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,050
So l can get those guys that
try to hurt you.

304
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,670
Don't be stupid!

305
00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:00,250
Hey, come on. Don't be so
fuckin' cruel to your son.

306
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,910
Mother.

307
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,080
Let's go home, Mother.

308
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,820
A...A monster...!

309
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,750
Mother...

310
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,690
Stop it!

311
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,530
Huh?!

312
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,120
Yuta!

313
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,140
Yuta! lt's me! Remember?!

314
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,430
Koji?

315
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,000
Mother?

316
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,280
What on earth has happened to you?!

317
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,380
Why do you look like some
horrendous monster?!

318
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,420
Mother...

319
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,220
Am l so strange?

320
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,320
No! Stay away!

321
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,220
Mother?

322
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:15,030
Listen Yuta, you are to never
come near me looking like that!

323
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,130
l'm living my life the way l want!

324
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,270
You're going to have to do that too.

325
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,670
No way! l don't want that!

326
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,740
l want to be with my Mother forever!

327
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,740
l can't have that!

328
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,650
But... Don't you love me?

329
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,050
When l think about it now, l
couldn't care less if l had a son.

330
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:44,350
Sons are inconvenient and
they get in the way.

331
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,990
l hate them!

332
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,700
Mother...

333
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,630
Yuta...!

334
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,170
Mother...

335
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,230
Who the hell does she think she is?

336
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,340
You think l want a son that
looks like that?

337
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,180
Don't ever show your face
in front of me again!

338
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,220
Mother...

339
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,320
Mother... Mother...

340
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,800
No! Yuta!

341
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,410
Oh, no!

342
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,620
Koji!

343
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,060
Koji...

344
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,810
Yuta, stop this now!

345
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,820
Koji!

346
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,950
lt's finally happening.

347
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,520
l'm getting excited. Hey,
who're you betting on?

348
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,190
Bet? You're kidding?

349
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,060
At this rate it's never going to end.

350
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,830
You've gotta enjoy some more.

351
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,620
Hey, it's you.

352
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,120
Good work.

353
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,730
Yuta...!

354
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,200
Yuta...

355
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,330
Koji!

356
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,430
He's trying to do a mind meld.

357
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,640
Mind meld?

358
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,980
Koji's trying to enter Yuta's consciousness.

359
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,450
Yuta...

360
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,850
Yuta!

361
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,100
Yuta...

362
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,150
Koji...

363
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,390
l can forgive you, Koji.

364
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,830
You don't do bad things,
so l can forgive you.

365
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,130
l'll forgive you. But...

366
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,400
Your rear gets nice and tight
when l fuck you in the pussy.

367
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,440
Your asshole's puckering up
nice and tight.

368
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,780
Let's just see
how much of a slut you are.

369
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,960
Ow...!

370
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,660
Spread open my asshole for me...

371
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,830
More, more...

372
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,450
l'm gonna cum!
l'm gonna cum...!

373
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,480
Help me! Help me! Help me!

374
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,420
No! Yuta!

375
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,890
Koji, l'll forgive you
if you don't get in my way.

376
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,460
Stop this now!

377
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,380
Yuta...!

378
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,450
l protected my mother.

379
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,960
l've done good.

380
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,460
They haven't moved in a while.

381
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,330
Shall we give it a go?

382
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,030
No, just leave this one to me.

383
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,710
She's gone in.

384
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,270
Koji's now at one with the monster.

385
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,370
She's trying to help him from inside.

386
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,380
Can that Jun do stuff like that?

387
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,010
Yuta...

388
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,780
l want you to hear me out.

389
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,320
You'd have a lot more fun playing
with the toy your grandpa gave you.

390
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,330
Don't you think?

391
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,060
l don't wanna play games.
l wanna protect my Mother.

392
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,230
l can't do anything with those things.

393
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:04,210
lf you want to protect your
mother, l can help you.

394
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,610
You just have to wait at home.

395
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,080
l want to stay with my Mother forever.

396
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,210
But that doesn't mean you
can go around killing people.

397
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,810
Come over here.

398
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,480
No!

399
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,850
Yuta...

400
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,020
Yuta!

401
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,690
Mother!

402
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,120
Mother...! Mother...!

403
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,770
Jun...!

404
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,540
Mother, l got the bad guys!
l got them for you!

405
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,580
Really? What a hero.

406
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,580
Let's go home together.

407
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,520
Yeah!

408
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,220
This could be a problem.

409
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,420
What's the matter?

410
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:58,590
His mind's resonating with the son's
and the son is starting to relax.

411
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,790
Do something about it.

412
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,960
That woman who went after
him has done something.

413
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,330
The bitch.

414
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,440
What's wrong, Mother?

415
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,140
You're not my Mother?!

416
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,690
Mother...? Mother...?

417
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,480
Where's Mother?!

418
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,450
Yuta!

419
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,390
Mother...!

420
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,890
l want you to disappear from my life!

421
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,870
Mother... Mother...

422
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,130
Mother!

423
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,740
Koji!

424
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,110
Yuta! Don't do it!

425
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,510
Koji!

426
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,050
What a crazy bastard, that Koji.

427
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,540
Very well done.

428
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,440
l'll be letting him know that
you've done good work.

429
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,820
By the way, have you made
preparations for the next?

430
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:01,940
Of course.

431
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,310
Very well.

432
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,750
l'm looking forward to it.

433
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:08,620
What a pompous bastard.

434
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:12,520
And he doesn't even realize
that he's being used.

435
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:27,070
The old man was cleaning up after
the mess left by his grandson.

436
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,380
That's why he was always
at the crime scene.
