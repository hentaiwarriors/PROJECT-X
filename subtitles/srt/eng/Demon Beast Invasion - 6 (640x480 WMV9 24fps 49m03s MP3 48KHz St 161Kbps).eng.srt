1
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,790
Mother... Mother!

2
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,840
MOTHER...!!!

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Demon Beast Invasion
episode 6
The Final Battle

4
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,420
Ahoy! Ahoy!

5
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,800
We're here! The beach
I've been dreaming of!

6
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,560
Clear skies, blue coral reefs,
and all the sun you could want!

7
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,850
Hey, Kayo. Isn't
this island great?!

8
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,860
Yeah. I've always wanted
to go to one of these...

9
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,190
...little uncharted
outer islands.

10
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,820
All right, all right! I don't
want you all wandering around!

11
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,240
Form up! Form up!
FORM UP!

12
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Okay, I'm going to check to
see if there's any problem...

13
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,170
...with our reservations and
the room assignments.

14
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,210
So wait here until I get back.
No wandering off, understand?

15
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,710
Yes, sir!

16
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,510
Hey, Muneto. How far apart
do you think they'll keep...

17
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,850
...us guys from the girls?

18
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,180
How should I know?

19
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,560
Cuz we may just
have a chance here.

20
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,070
You idiot.
To sneak out at night.

21
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,530
Yoshioka.

22
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,570
Man, women expect you
to do things like that...

23
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,570
...in a carefree
situation like this!

24
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,240
You think so?

25
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,410
I know so.
So, when do we break out?

26
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,370
You just like to
get down to business.

27
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,710
I've just been thinking
about this trip...

28
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,590
...since they decided
on it last month!

29
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,920
I can't hold it in!

30
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,920
I'm gonna burst!

31
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,900
Isn't it great? Just the sort
of setting for two people...

32
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,110
...to give in to a
romantic love adventure.

33
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,950
Careful, Chika.

34
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,410
Well, even if those stupid
guys in our class don't come...

35
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,790
...we've got some real
hunks on this island, too.

36
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,420
To be taken up in a
salt-scented embrace...

37
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,130
Oh, that'd be great.

38
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,090
What's up, Muneto?

39
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,090
Kayo, do you want to take a
private trip out onto the sea?

40
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,850
But...

41
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,140
Come on! It's a chance
for us to be alone.

42
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,100
And I've got the coolest
boat lined up for us.

43
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,800
Get in.

44
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,660
This is great!

45
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,490
Isn't it?

46
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,350
Fantastic! They look like
something from another world.

47
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,180
Uh-huh.

48
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,730
I wanted to get you in this
mood so we could really get close.

49
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,350
Careful, careful...

50
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,020
Don't let that nasty little
guy spoil the mood.

51
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,280
Kayo, please?

52
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,370
I want this special feeling
to last a little longer.

53
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,590
Kayo... Me, too!

54
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,770
Mother! Mother!

55
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,400
Mother! Mother!

56
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,780
Mother's scent! My Mother!

57
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,660
Something's calling me...
The Demon Beast?

58
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,410
Calling to me... No!

59
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,370
Asakura!

60
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,420
Ungyosai!

61
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,750
Shit, it's Shinoda!

62
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,420
Hey! Kayo!
Kayo? Get in here!

63
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,710
Hurry!

64
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,470
Kayo!

65
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,780
You shittin' me, Gramps?

66
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,160
It's an old, old story
on this island.

67
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,330
Muneto!

68
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,620
Where did you go? Shinoda
was looking for you.

69
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,460
Anyway, what's got everybody
looking so serious?

70
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,130
That thing there. That thing.

71
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,300
That islet has a beautiful
and sad legend behind it.

72
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,850
I've heard of the Untamagiruu
and the other nature spirits..

73
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,480
...that are supposed to
live on Okinawa.

74
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,150
But is this sea monster
one of them, Gramps?

75
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,530
Monster?

76
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,400
It might very well be.

77
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,780
It may just be an old legend...

78
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,830
...but some girls on this
island claim to have seen it.

79
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,580
Come on, what's the story?
Tell it to me, too.

80
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,170
On this island, we believe
that the souls of the dead...

81
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,340
...return after going to their
home at the ends of the sea.

82
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,180
Long ago, a village girl found
a strange creature on that islet.

83
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,850
It would have died without
someone to look after it...

84
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,900
...and she raised it as lovingly
as she would have her own child.

85
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,370
The sea monster grew up.

86
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,500
Its ugliness became so great...

87
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,920
...that the girl dared not
bring it home with her.

88
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,510
She knew that if the
adults on the island...

89
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,800
...discovered its existence,
they would kill it.

90
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,850
And so, on rainy days and
windy days as well...

91
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,560
...the girl would go to the
islet and care for the creature...

92
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,230
...like it was her own child.

93
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,460
On the night of a storm,
the wounded monster lay dying.

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,460
As she nursed it,
it suddenly became aroused.

95
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,590
The poor girl,
half mad with grief...

96
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,970
...decided to satisfy its
desire with her own body.

97
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,210
The monster was dead.

98
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,880
The girl's parents were furious
when she refused to tell them...

99
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,260
...the name of the father of
the child she now carried.

100
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,560
One day, they conspired with
their friends to kill the child.

101
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,140
How dare you shame me!

102
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,740
What the hell...?

103
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,700
As she desperately tried to
protect her monstrous child...

104
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,040
...the villagers smashed it
to death before her eyes.

105
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,670
Stop it! NO!!!

106
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,380
But the girl
refused to give up.

107
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,390
She set out upon the water,
pursuing her child's soul...

108
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,050
...to the ocean's end.
She never returned.

109
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,060
Her father and the others,
touched with pity for her...

110
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,020
...built a shrine to
her memory on the islet.

111
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,230
And then they prayed to the sea,
fearing its retribution.

112
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,740
And that's the story.

113
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,820
That creature's supposed to
return to this island someday.

114
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,080
And perhaps the spirit of
that girl, now reborn...

115
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,750
...awaits its return as well.

116
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,920
Kinda scary, but it's
still a sad story.

117
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,430
That little islet has a
weird legend attached to it.

118
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,820
Now wait a second!
How can you be in the mood...

119
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,440
...after hearing
that creepy story?

120
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,990
That has nothing
to do with this.

121
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:37,870
Some old superstition isn't gonna
get rid of this bulge in my shorts!

122
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,450
So why do I have to
come along with you?

123
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,040
What's your beef?

124
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,460
Running out on our
own is against the rules.

125
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,960
With the two of us,
we're covered.

126
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,460
It's a happy
little adventure.

127
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,510
Whatever, man.

128
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,140
God, I can practically
smell the juice in 'em!

129
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,350
Ungyosai!

130
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,060
What are you doing here?!

131
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,770
Don't scare me
like that, Professor!

132
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,440
I couldn't sleep, so I
figured I'd take a walk.

133
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,570
Somehow I doubt that.

134
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,820
It's the truth! Believe me!

135
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,490
After you and Voshioka said I
should be out here on watch?

136
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,540
I'll bet you were trying for
a midnight rendezvous!

137
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,870
No way. Look, I happen to
come from a temple family.

138
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,960
Don't go bad-mouthing people!

139
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,790
So, I'm to take you
at your word, eh?

140
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,840
All right, if you can't
sleep, you can come with me.

141
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,590
Night rounds. We have a duty to
protect the ladies of the class.

142
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,600
Oh, man...

143
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,940
Okay, okay...

144
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,200
Look at Satoh go!
She's soaking wet!

145
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,270
Mother! Mother!

146
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,250
I can't take this!

147
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,980
You want to do it again?

148
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,820
What a babe!

149
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,700
Come on!

150
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,880
Hang on.
I'll find your mother.

151
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
No one else
will ever find you!

152
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,680
Breakfast!
Everybody, fall in!

153
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,650
I can't take this...

154
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,110
Just when I was finally asleep.

155
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,730
Yoshioka? Where's Yoshioka?

156
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,990
Didn't he come?

157
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,990
Now that you mention it,
his bed wasn't slept in.

158
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,660
That son of a bitch must've
gotten some by himself!

159
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,620
He better not have gone
after Kayo last night!

160
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,630
Somebody look for him!
No, EVERYONE look for him!

161
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,720
Until we find him,
nobody gets to eat!

162
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,010
Hey, Yoshioka!

163
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,050
Where the hell are you?!

164
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,690
Muneto.

165
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,690
Kayo!

166
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,020
You're okay?
Tell me you're okay!

167
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,690
What are you
talking about?

168
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,360
Keep this quiet. Yoshioka snuck
over to the girls' inn last night.

169
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,620
No way!

170
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,780
Kayo, you're okay, right?

171
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,410
Of course I am.

172
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,210
Thank goodness.

173
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,420
There was something
strange, though.

174
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,420
Ever since we came here...

175
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,050
I've been hearing the
Demon Beast calling to me.

176
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,180
That's impossible.
That thing's gone from this world.

177
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:12,680
I know. But I hear it.
Is it my imagination?

178
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,560
It has to be.

179
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,230
Maybe being in a strange
place has you on edge.

180
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,690
Yeah... Maybe you're right.

181
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,570
Forget it. Forget it.

182
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,910
Once you're used to this place,
you'll feel better.

183
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,920
Professor! Professor!
Yoshioka's... It's horrible!

184
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,580
What is it, Kamimura?!

185
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,750
He's... He's dead!

186
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,300
What?!

187
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,640
What happened?

188
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,150
Professor, somebody's
sliced his... thing off!

189
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,650
It's okay.

190
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,950
This doesn't have anything
to do with the Demon Beast.

191
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,910
Nothing at all!

192
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,080
The Demon Beast is dead!

193
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,590
I want you all to stand
by with your luggage!

194
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,630
Please, the police!
You have to call the police!

195
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,930
I'm sorry, but we don't
have a phone on this island.

196
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,930
A radio, then!
Surely you have a radio!

197
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,940
Well... It's broken.

198
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:41,650
Then from somebody else's house!
This is a murder, for God's sake!

199
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,980
It's not that simple.

200
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,360
They may not want to help if it
means scaring the tourists away.

201
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,990
Then the boat! When does
the ferry come back?!

202
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,410
On the day you
scheduled it to come.

203
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,830
Why do I even ask?!

204
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,710
No, don't...

205
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,720
Stop it!

206
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,180
Please...

207
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,890
I'll never forget
how this feels!

208
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,440
More! More!

209
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,950
Poor thing.
She wasn't your mother.

210
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,740
You got that?! You keep the
doors bolted when you sleep!

211
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,960
Especially the girls!
Don't unlock them for anything!

212
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,750
Now, for the boys.

213
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,790
How many of you have the
guts and brains to volunteer...

214
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,420
...to form into teams
to patrol the area?!

215
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,760
- Ungyosai!
- Yes, sir!

216
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,430
You and I will guard the
girls' compound tonight!

217
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,100
Yes, sir!

218
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,850
This time we'll find
your real mother.

219
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,150
You are the king.

220
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,860
Until your parts bring her to you,
you must hang in there.

221
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,510
Muneto, can't we leave it like this...

222
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,760
...to call you back if
something happens here?

223
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,810
No way.

224
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,430
What good's a lock when the
window's wide open?

225
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,860
We can't do anything about it.
None of the windows here lock.

226
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,860
I guess nothing like this has
ever happened on this island.

227
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,530
Oh, really?!

228
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:18,370
So I guess we're the ones who
brought trouble to paradise!

229
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,790
I didn't mean that.
I didn't...

230
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,670
Okay, switch off!

231
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,140
Ungyosai! Now that you've
had your bath, meal, and nap...

232
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,600
...grab your rain gear and get
over here! Three-hour shifts!

233
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,810
Yes, sir!

234
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,890
Rest of you, go to bed!

235
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,560
Yes, sir!

236
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,570
Think it's the
monster's revenge?

237
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,480
Cut it out! You want to
sleep or don't you?

238
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,200
Could it be the Demon Beast...?

239
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,910
No! It couldn't be!
It's impossible!

240
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,270
Like some sort of fairy...

241
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,940
Professor, come with me.

242
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,780
I've been waiting
for this chance!

243
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,450
I want you to
make love to me...

244
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,400
I love you! I love you!
I LOVE YOU!!!

245
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,720
I mustn't let you
interfere with them.

246
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,660
Mother! Mother!

247
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,660
Mother!

248
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,210
Kayo!

249
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,310
Kayo!

250
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,430
Muneto!

251
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,770
Shit!

252
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,810
You fucking little...!

253
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,110
Muneto!

254
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,040
Stop it! Stop it!

255
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,420
Mother!

256
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,130
Mother!

257
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,800
Mother!

258
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,300
Stop it! I can't
take this anymore!

259
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,890
Kayo!

260
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,820
Demon Beast, begone!
Take this!

261
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,210
Mother!

262
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,500
Mother!

263
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,180
Muneto! Take Kayo
and get out of here!

264
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,510
Who are you?

265
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,140
Interplanetary Mutual Observation
Agency Demon Beast Buster.

266
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,440
Code name: Irimote.

267
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,190
What?!

268
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,230
You mean the Demon Beast's...
It's come back to life again?!

269
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,860
I'll explain in detail later.

270
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,610
Unless we get Kayo away from it,
we can't stop its resurrection!

271
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,200
Take Kayo with you and head
for the northern promontory!

272
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:53,990
Move it!

273
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,250
Move it!

274
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,550
Kayo!

275
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,560
It's her...

276
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,610
That girl... The mother!

277
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,370
Kayo! Kayo!
Are you all right?

278
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,910
Yeah.

279
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,250
Never mind me...

280
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,630
Everyone's gotten
caught in this nightmare!

281
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,210
It's all my fault!
What do we do?!

282
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,630
What do we do?!
What do we do?!

283
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,930
Calm down! Get a hold
of yourself, Kayo!

284
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,930
Muneto...

285
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,930
You're the one
the Demon Beast wants.

286
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,310
If you lose your head,
he'll take you for sure.

287
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,610
Muneto...

288
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,620
Glad I caught you.

289
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,960
The Demon Beast... It wasn't
destroyed completely?

290
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:27,750
No, it was. But its
soul has returned.

291
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,960
Its what?!

292
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,170
You should know by now.

293
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,970
That thing has life and healing
power beyond any human's.

294
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,650
Mother!

295
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,990
The soul of the
dead Demon Beast...

296
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,620
...floated bodiless
in the void of space.

297
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,710
But it couldn't forget the
smell of Kayo's womb.

298
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,640
Particles of it collected
on a meteor bound for Earth...

299
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,350
...and, unknown to anyone,
returned them to the surface.

300
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,650
The particles containing its
memories dissolved into the sea...

301
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,650

302
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,070
...to be reborn
in a suitable form.

303
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,410
Something a bit like
a sea anemone

304
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,050
You're saying it came to
this island to wait for Kayo?

305
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,720
Yes. It possesses precognitive
powers ten thousand times...

306
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,760
...more sensitive than a whale's
hearing from pole to pole.

307
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,020
It foresaw Kayo coming here
and prepared to be reborn.

308
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,730
That's impossible!

309
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:14,070
But Kayo and the others were
attacked by Demon Beast larvae.

310
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,610
- You saw them!
- Yeah...

311
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,070
But why was Kayo the
only one they didn't latch on to?

312
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,740
Because it still
trusts its mother.

313
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,790
It threatens to turn the
world into hell itself.

314
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,420
If it gains control of Kayo's womb,
it will gain enormous power.

315
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,090
Enough to be reborn
as the devil himself.

316
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,130
You've got to be kidding!

317
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,760
So, the Beast is
somewhere near this island?

318
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:45,810
Yes. So we have to kill it
before it can have Kayo!

319
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:55,480
To prepare for its rebirth,
the Demon Beast needs sustenance.

320
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,110
The larvae that attacked
the girls at the inn...

321
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,160
...have probably taken
them back to their king.

322
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,700
What?!

323
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,160
They're just like ants or bees.

324
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:13,170
They're drones, clones with the
genetic information of their king.

325
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,710
Think of them as parts of the
entire horrible Demon Beast.

326
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,140
The sea monster on this island.

327
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,680
Are you sure this isn't it?
Maybe it isn't the Demon Beast.

328
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,650
Accept reality. They were
calling Kayo mother!

329
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,270
Didn't you hear them?!

330
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:42,490
What do we do? If that
monster is fully reborn...

331
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,080
...it wouldn't stop with
the people on this island!

332
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,120
Japan... The whole world
would be destroyed!

333
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,130
Try to remember, Kayo!

334
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,920
You've beaten it so far by
invoking the power of Maitreya!

335
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,840
There's a shrine to Maitreya built
by ancient Chinese monks...

336
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,890
...on the cliffs of this island.

337
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,470
A Maitreya statue?

338
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,470
Reach those
heights again, Muneto!

339
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,190
If you and Kayo give your bodies
over to the summit of passion...

340
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:15,190
...Maitreya's great power
will be released.

341
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,400
Then you can defeat
the Demon Beast!

342
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,190
Muneto!

343
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,570
Sure! I love Kayo!
I can do it anytime!

344
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:30,540
But, I... I'm not exactly
in the mood right now...

345
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,580
What are you
talking about, Kayo?!

346
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,210
Our happiness
can save the world!

347
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,210
Girls feel a little more
naive about these things...

348
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:45,720
I can't make love to you
at a time like this!

349
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,470
No way!

350
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,890
Ow! Kayo!

351
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,810
Oh...
I don't believe you!

352
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,070
Anyway, let's get to
the Maitreya shrine!

353
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,900
- Right!
- Okay, let's go!

354
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,980
Landslide.

355
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,940
It isn't a recent one, either.

356
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,280
Sometime before, a typhoon
must have collapsed the cliff...

357
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,950
...along with the statue.

358
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,950
God dammit!

359
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,540
We can't give up.

360
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,290
It's probably sunk into the
beach by the coral reef.

361
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,960
Let's start looking for it!

362
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,920
Irimote!

363
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,630
What's wrong?

364
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,800
I won't let you
touch my child!

365
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,600
Who are you?!

366
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,020
You... You're its mother.

367
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,310
I envy you.

368
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,650
Who the hell are you?!

369
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,690
Back off, pal!

370
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,320
You must understand.

371
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:30,910
I found the child. And I
raised it like it was my own.

372
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,950
I was its mother... I was!

373
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:40,000
But, the day you
came to this island...!

374
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,840
All the days of joy
we shared were ruined!

375
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,010
The joy between us...
The child and me!

376
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,820
Mother?

377
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,370
What?

378
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:21,040
Mother!
Mother comes! Mother!

379
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,050
Mother!

380
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,090
But I'm your mother!

381
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,390
Mother! Mother!

382
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,430
Why?
Ain't I your mother?

383
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,940
MOTHER!!!

384
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,660
I was so lonely...
Heartbroken!

385
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,750
I thought I was their mother,
who was to raise them.

386
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,790
But that was
to be someone else!

387
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,300
It was you, Kayo!

388
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,470
You don't know
what you're doing.

389
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,850
That thing you're protecting
is a horrible Demon Beast.

390
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,770
It's the poor sea monster,
who's returned to the island!

391
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,060
And I welcomed it!

392
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:30,110
No! It's not the creature
from that sad old legend.

393
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,450
It's a devil, bent on
destroying the entire world!

394
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,120
A devil, huh? Fine.

395
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,620
I may not like it,
but as its follower...

396
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,170
...I have to bring Kayo to it!
Kayo, prepare yourself!

397
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,130
Stop it!

398
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,130
Muneto!

399
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:06,480
I may not like it...
But she is its mother.

400
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,150
I will do as it wishes.

401
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,490
Kayo!

402
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,930
Mother! Power!
Give me your power!

403
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,550
Gasp with pleasure!
Cry out in delight!

404
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,390
Are you really so joyful
at my rebirth?

405
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:33,570
More pleasure! This is
your true nature.

406
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:40,950
And then soon, soon...
You will overflow!

407
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,080
Playthings!

408
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,880
I'll suck
it all from you!

409
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,260
I'll drain all
your love juices...

410
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:01,300
...and then join you all
into my own body!

411
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,950
Mother!
Mother, where are you?!

412
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,700
Give me your power!

413
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,660
Give me your power!

414
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,250
Here! Your mother,
just like you wanted.

415
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,920
Do what you want with her!

416
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,960
Hurry up! Take the
immortal love from her!

417
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,090
Mother!

418
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,890
Mother!

419
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,020
Stop it! Let me go!

420
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:04,990
Mother! Oh, your scent!
Ah, how wet you are!

421
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,330
How happy you are
to see me again!

422
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,330
Oh, joyous day! Mother!

423
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,340
Show me more. More!

424
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:22,010
How it wriggles,
how it must wait for me!

425
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,680
Have you been
waiting too, Mother?

426
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,060
Have you desired me as well?!

427
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,400
Now I will do as I wish!

428
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,230
Eat this!

429
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,330
Kayo!

430
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,420
Go! Don't let them escape!

431
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,380
Mother!

432
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,760
Kayo, while I'm drawing
him off from here...

433
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,760
...you run for if
from the other side.

434
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:09,890
Muneto!

435
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,400
Muneto!

436
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,020
The statue of Maitreya!

437
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:09,450
I love you, Kayo.

438
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,790
Muneto!

439
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:29,200
Muneto! Muneto!
Oh, yes! YES!

440
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:01,020
Mother!

441
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,460
She was a strange girl.

442
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:30,470
Yeah.

443
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:36,180
Maybe she'll live on, just
another legend for this island.

444
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:45,650
I think, maybe... Maybe
I understand how she felt.

445
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,820
Don't be stupid!

446
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,150
Kayo, I'd never let anything
take you from me, ever!

447
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,860
Muneto...
