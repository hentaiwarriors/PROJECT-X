1
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:24,260
A student like you is a
disgrace to the name of Horioni.

2
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,699
You will never draw another tattoo.

3
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,668
N-No!

4
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:32,098
Please don't!

5
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,744
Flo!

6
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:52,727
Dear!

7
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:54,256
Dear!

8
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,555
Wake up!

9
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:58,763
Oh Dear, no, please...

10
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,862
To tell the truth,
I didn't know why but...

11
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:04,138
...I was very calm.

12
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:09,837
When I heard that detective
Enokido had been attacked...

13
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:15,585
...I wasn't surprised, but I thought
it had been only a matter of time...

14
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,812
And my thoughts were confirmed...

15
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:23,751
...when I heard that the
weapon was a needle for...

16
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,487
...carving tattoos.

17
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,031
I'm home.

18
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,334
We are now...

19
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:45,474
...becoming involved with something...

20
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,244
...something extremely horrifying.

21
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:58,894
Something hidden from the public eye...

22
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,129
Nozomi!

23
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,634
Help me...

24
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,435
The secret of the living tattoo...

25
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,091
Slop!

26
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,032
Please don't hurt her anymore!

27
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:08,356
No...

28
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,697
No, don't...

29
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:20,574
Flo!

30
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:40,756
Wait.

31
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:45,563
If you want it <i>so</i> bad, you can have me.

32
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:49,701
So...

33
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:53,100
Please leave Nozomi alone.

34
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:03,779
I'm coming...

35
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:10,682
I' m sorry.

36
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:12,048
It's okay.

37
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:16,555
It's my duty to protect you.

38
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,223
And...

39
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,201
...I don't mind being with you.

40
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,733
Look, I'm not...

41
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:34,301
Um, I'm not a lesbian, okay?

42
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,175
I'm kidding.

43
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:38,574
Forget it.

44
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,381
What's wrong?

45
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:49,651
Are you okay?

46
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:51,317
Yes .

47
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,392
Is that morning sickness?

48
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,360
It's nothing.

49
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,702
Have you gone to the hospital yet?

50
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:02,735
Why?

51
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,535
I want you to get rid of it!

52
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:09,837
That's a mean thing to say,
it's your baby, after all.

53
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:10,806
No, it's not!

54
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:11,777
It's the ogre's!

55
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,312
I don't care...

56
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,312
If the baby has the will to be born...

57
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:18,721
...I'll give birth to it.

58
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:19,880
But...

59
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:25,190
I don't care if
something happens to me.

60
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,102
Come over here.

61
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,305
Look at that.

62
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:43,078
There.

63
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:43,703
Over there.

64
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,475
That's him.

65
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,092
He's probably in some kind of shock.

66
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,997
He's completely shut away.

67
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:11,674
He cannot kill people anymore,
much less draw tattoos.

68
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,437
His left arm was severed...

69
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:18,471
...and the nerves in his right
arm are severely damaged.

70
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:20,572
You know, like your boss...

71
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,681
This is the same case
as detective Enokido's...

72
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,155
There is a puncture wound
from a needle on his arm.

73
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,193
It's a warning...

74
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,058
Someone wants us
to stop searching...

75
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,928
I'm worried about you.

76
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,139
Why haven't you come for a checkup?

77
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,635
It's better to take care of this soon.

78
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,242
She said the same thing.

79
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:49,269
Who?

80
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,606
I would like to start...

81
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:53,843
Are you ready?

82
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:09,856
Scared?

83
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,491
I' m okay.

84
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:15,194
This is the only way I can help you.

85
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:18,407
Look over here!

86
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:30,481
This is Horioni':
tattoo, the one you wanted!

87
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,818
You wanted to have this, right?

88
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:44,397
What's wrong, Kure?

89
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:45,292
Are you okay?

90
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,200
We're okay.

91
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,097
Don't worry.

92
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,765
Take a good look!

93
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,876
And try to remember!

94
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,978
Who did this to you?

95
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,411
Who took your tattoo from you?

96
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,551
It's Horioni, isn't it?

97
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,855
D-Damn you...

98
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,596
I don't care if you're Horioni': woman.

99
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,731
I'll make you pay for this!

100
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,729
Jun Ando!

101
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,273
I'll make you pay...

102
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,311
I'll make you pay for my arm!

103
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:30,405
Jun!

104
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:35,647
Jun Ando...

105
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,274
Clumsy bitch!

106
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,887
How many times do I have to
tell you not to use your teeth?

107
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,525
Mm sorry, rm Sorry

108
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,657
I don't need a slow learner like you.

109
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:20,790
BYE bye.

110
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:23,562
Please forgive me, please!

111
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:32,667
Detective?

112
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,375
Bring him here.

113
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,843
Let's all have some fun.

114
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:48,948
<i>Jun Ando'?</i>

115
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:50,625
I don't know.

116
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,724
I've heard she is the lover of
a tattoo artist called Horioni...

117
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,901
No girls have a tattoos in my place.

118
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,896
Girls like that are usually
hanging around the harbor.

119
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:04,533
Thank you.

120
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:06,002
Hey, you!

121
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:11,275
You're cute, female
customers are welcome, too.

122
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,581
Wanna come in?

123
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:15,318
Maybe next time.

124
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:18,953
Why didn't that bother you?

125
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,218
I'm used to it.

126
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,688
So, it is true...

127
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:23,458
Huh?

128
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:28,154
You said that you don't dislike
girls the other day, remember?

129
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,365
You have experience, right?

130
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,892
I was raped.

131
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,705
Just ten years ago...

132
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,142
It was awful.

133
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,375
I trusted no one for a while.

134
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:51,520
I was scared to be in
public, <i>so</i> I shut myself away.

135
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,890
Then somebody extended
a helping hand to me...

136
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,326
She was my best friend.

137
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:04,727
She taught me...

138
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:07,599
...the joy of being loved by someone.

139
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,561
I was happy-

140
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,235
I'm not the like you.

141
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,448
I can't get over it yet.

142
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,017
I can't love people yet.

143
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:24,143
I'm dirty now...

144
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,253
I don't have the right
to be loved by anybody.

145
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,854
That's not true.

146
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:35,593
I'll interview a few more people, so...

147
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:36,692
...just wait here.

148
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:38,100
Okay...

149
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:46,475
Oh no!

150
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:48,042
Damn...

151
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,406
You bitch...

152
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,649
What do you want?

153
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,385
Shut up!

154
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,554
You're under arrest for
interfering with a police investigation!

155
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,086
Not bad...

156
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,462
...Miss Detective.

157
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,133
My boss wants to see you.

158
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,026
Would you come with us?

159
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,309
Welcome, Miss Detective.

160
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:22,641
You are...

161
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:24,238
You are the boss?

162
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,441
I'm pretty surprised myself.

163
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:30,181
I've heard that a detective was
snooping around about Horioni, so...

164
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,312
...I thought it would be some old man.

165
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,015
But, who knew it was
a beautiful woman?

166
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,023
You know about Horioni.

167
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,959
Why won't people leave us alone?

168
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,496
He has done nothing wrong.

169
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:43,525
Tell me!

170
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:44,697
Where is Horioni?

171
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,563
Are you Jun Ando?

172
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:48,294
Are you?

173
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:49,201
Be quiet!

174
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,601
Lick it.

175
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:56,211
If you lick my foot, I'll tell you.

176
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,806
Don't make me laugh!

177
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,541
Don't use your teeth.

178
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,753
Slowly, and use your tongue...

179
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,655
Not satisfied with my toe, huh?

180
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,826
Someone, make her feel better.

181
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:24,969
Flo!

182
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:27,874
I've warned you...

183
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,843
...not to look for Horioni.

184
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,384
You people are like ants...

185
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,913
...following the scent of food.

186
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,816
I have to punish you.

187
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:44,827
Right?

188
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:03,736
What's that?

189
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:15,549
Who the hell are you?

190
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,231
L-it can't be...

191
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:25,224
Is this...

192
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:30,504
What the fuck is that?

193
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,243
N-Nozomi...

194
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:54,062
Please, go now!

195
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:56,661
Why...

196
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:03,570
Why...

197
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:08,570
Why is that here?

198
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,208
Why?

199
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,493
Horioni': work...

200
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,102
I won't forgive you!

201
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,511
I will never forgive you!

202
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:46,849
Hey...

203
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,150
What's wrong, Kure?

204
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:50,782
What happened?

205
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,587
<i>Jun Ando.</i>

206
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,552
She's Horioni': lover.

207
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:56,225
What?

208
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:58,889
She attacked detective Enokido.

209
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,955
Please go arrest her immediately!

210
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,496
Where's the investigative section?

211
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,235
What is this in regard to?

212
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,035
H-Hey!

213
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,973
Who are you?

214
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,241
What's that?

215
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:18,180
I'll go.

216
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:23,949
Wait, hey!

217
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:25,621
Slop!

218
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,618
Wait!

219
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,985
Slop!

220
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,988
<i>S-S-Stop!</i>

221
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,825
W-What the...

222
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:41,868
H-Hey!

223
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,172
You!

224
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:45,199
What are you doing here?

225
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,514
Don't worry, I'm here...

226
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:01,651
Mr. Tagami?

227
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:08,263
No more hide-and-seek.

228
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,768
Now, it's my turn to play.

229
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,261
Jun Ando...

230
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:18,398
Yes...

231
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:20,772
I'm Jun Ando.

232
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,705
Oh no, you too...

233
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,183
That's right.

234
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,450
I have one of Horioni':
tattoos, just like you.

235
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,725
I was chosen to be
the canvas for Horioni...

236
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:46,401
My skin is one in a million.

237
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:52,163
I'm Horioni': masterpiece!

238
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:53,699
Nozomi!

239
00:18:58,236 --> 00:18:58,976
Nozomi!

240
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:05,311
No...

241
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,418
Let go of me!

242
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:10,387
Yes, it's Horioni': work.

243
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:15,359
Call your ogre, and
show it to me again!

244
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,098
What's wrong, show it to me.

245
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:22,136
Or is it not worth showing to me?

246
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:28,808
He's coming.

247
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:49,295
Who could compare me
to this puny creature?

248
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:50,928
Don't make me laugh!

249
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,663
Flo!

250
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,129
Slop it!

251
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,406
Don't hurt her, please!

252
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:00,608
Shut up!

253
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:04,608
Look at her...

254
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,948
You can't have your ogre
come out and help her anymore.

255
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,553
You useless piece of shit.

256
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:19,992
Besides...

257
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:25,823
...no matter what happens to you,
the ogre can't save you either.

258
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:26,702
Flo!

259
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:27,999
Slop it!

260
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,997
Are you a virgin?

261
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:34,635
I see...

262
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,502
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

263
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:38,981
No!
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

264
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,641
Yes !

265
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,489
Please stop it!

266
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,151
I'll do it...

267
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:52,152
I'll do anything you want.

268
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:53,919
So, please don't hurt her!

269
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,097
Okay then.

270
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:04,266
Yes...

271
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,572
Put both in by yourself.

272
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,510
What's wrong?

273
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:13,511
Do it now!

274
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,556
She's thrusting her hips by herself!

275
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:24,824
Whore!

276
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:27,886
Feels good, huh?

277
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:29,729
Say you feel good!

278
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:34,631
Y-Yes, I feel good...

279
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:35,827
Oh?

280
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:38,839
I guess you're not
interested in foreplay.

281
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:40,939
Well then...

282
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,546
Let's do something really fun!

283
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:46,813
N-No!

284
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:49,048
Don't, please, stop it!

285
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,412
Please, don't!

286
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,447
Flo!

287
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,124
Flo!

288
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,581
Why are you doing this?

289
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:00,017
It's quite a show, isn't it?

290
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:00,117
Please make them stop.
It's quite a show, isn't it?

291
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:00,823
Please make them stop.

292
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,889
She's pregnant!

293
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:05,059
Oh really?

294
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:06,235
Well then...

295
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,637
Thrust harder!

296
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,040
Don't!

297
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:14,334
My baby...

298
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,610
You'll kill my baby!

299
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:17,843
How awful...

300
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:21,081
You're evil, you're not a human being!

301
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,277
You're a demon wearing
the skin of human!

302
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,715
Don't talk fresh!

303
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:34,353
You're the monster who
carries that pitiful ogre on your back!

304
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:41,834
But, you're still my friend, we
both wear the art of Horioni.

305
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,606
We should get along well.

306
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:58,283
Are you ready?

307
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,117
That hurts!

308
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:01,389
No...

309
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:03,587
Let's have some fun together!

310
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:06,887
Flo!

311
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:08,964
No...

312
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:10,631
Please don't...

313
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,231
How is it?

314
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:17,505
Don't you feel good?

315
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,033
Come if you want to.

316
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,443
It hurts...

317
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,541
Stop it, please...

318
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:27,512
My baby...

319
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:29,142
My baby!

320
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:30,377
Yes...

321
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,880
Oh yes!

322
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:33,017
Both of you...

323
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:35,053
Come!

324
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,655
I can tell, you both are enjoying
getting fucked like this, aren't you?

325
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:41,895
Yes, yes...

326
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,028
Come on, let's come together!

327
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,064
Oh, I'm coming...

328
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,066
...coming...

329
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:54,840
Come with me...

330
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,441
Oh yes, I'm coming...

331
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,177
Yes !

332
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,273
Nozomi?

333
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:37,979
Oh God...

334
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,221
N-No...

335
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,430
Flo!

336
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:57,331
That moment, I lost
something very precious.
