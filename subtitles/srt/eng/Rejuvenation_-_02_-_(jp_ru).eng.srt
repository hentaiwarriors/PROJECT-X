1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,540
Kenji!

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,840
Let go of me!
Why are you doing this?!

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,010
Master Shingo is waiting for you, Yuko.

4
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,340
Forgive me.

5
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:46,740
SACRlLEGE

6
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,770
Kenji!

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,140
Yuko!

8
00:00:50,250 --> 00:01:02,140

9
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,920
An accident?

10
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,670
Kenji!

11
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,370
Yuko...

12
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,670
So, you lost the only
good subject you had?

13
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,210
That's really unfortunate.

14
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,810
We're putting everything
into finding him right now.

15
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,320
The spies seem to be snooping around.

16
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,260
Finding the subject right now...

17
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,090
...is the top priority.

18
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,600
The woman you got a hold of...

19
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,540
...can be used to draw out the subject?

20
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,110
We have very little time left.

21
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,110
I hope you understand that.

22
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,050
Yes.

23
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,870
Why is this medicine here?

24
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,680
There's a limited number
of people who have access to it.

25
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,110
Is it a top secret new drug?

26
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,080
Kaizear Pharmaceuticals.

27
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,480
Is it an anabolic steroid?

28
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,020
If this was found at
the site of the incident...

29
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,130
I'm sure it has something
to do with the experiments.

30
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,180
You think it has something
to do with that monster?

31
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,660
Kenji, do you remember anything
about those who kidnapped Yuko?

32
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,170
Uh, I'm sorry.

33
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,970
It was all very sudden.
I don't remember it too well.

34
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,000
I see.

35
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,550
What do you think those women were?

36
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,240
The one's that looked like priestesses?

37
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,450
I hear you were no match for them!

38
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,910
Can it! You keep your mouth shut!

39
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,820
Jun...

40
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,690
Get as much information you can
on Kaizear Pharmaceuticals.

41
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,600
Okay!

42
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,470
And Atsuko, we're heading straight in!

43
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,870
All right!

44
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,330
No, Kei! It's too dangerous!

45
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,150
Don't worry.
We're just going to take a look around.

46
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,580
And I'm also worried about Yuko.

47
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm sorry for causing so much trouble.

48
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,630
You don't have to worry about Kei.

49
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,430
Besides, Atsuko's with her.
Nothing to worry about!

50
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,600
And this is our work, after all.

51
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,600
And I really don't mind
doing this work for you.

52
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,200
Thank you.

53
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,270
We're all linked up here.
How about over there, Jun?

54
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,200
It's all set. Just hang on.

55
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,740
How is it?

56
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,440
Leave it to me.
I'm really good at this sort of thing.

57
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,680
I can figure out any
password they ask for.

58
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,090
When it comes to hiding treasure,
dogs and criminals are the same.

59
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,090
They'll dig a hole and bury it there.

60
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,370
But they always hide
it in the same places.

61
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,100
Such fools they are.

62
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,340
There! Bingo!

63
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,670
Human genome?

64
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,680
Human genome?!

65
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,160
Wow, this is amazing!

66
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,350
They've even tried to analyze
the human aging process.

67
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,700
I know you're excited about this, Jun.
But tell us what's going on?

68
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,900
Have you figured something out?

69
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,100
There's a genetic map here.

70
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,010
And some sort of anti-aging substance?

71
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,810
Th-This can't be!

72
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,140
You mean to say that the
new drug they're developing is...

73
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
Hey, what's going on?!
I was just on to something!

74
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,970
What? What just happened?

75
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,740
Huh? That's really strange.

76
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,420
I thought I invalidated
the protection system.

77
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,350
Hey, something's really weird here, Kei.

78
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,820
Wh-What did I do again?

79
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,210
Mari.

80
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,420
Yuko...

81
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,350
Hurry, there's little time left.

82
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:16,040
No, please. I beg you. Let me go.

83
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,710
A wretched woman.
Getting all wet like this.

84
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,560
Oh, you're so terrible.

85
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,790
It is tough? Are you suffering?

86
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,520
But there's no choice in the matter.

87
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,320
It's penance, after all.

88
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,190
It's all the result of
your brother's karma.

89
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,130
M-My brother?

90
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,470
What did my brother do?

91
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,900
That man!

92
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:56,740
My sister is not one who should
associate with the likes of you!

93
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,920
Could your sister possibly be Yuko?

94
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:45,920

Please, no more...!

96
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,200
I'll show you mercy!
Writhe and moan!

97
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,490
Consider this to be a divine duty!

98
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,230
Oh, no!

99
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,150
Whoa!

100
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,980
Hey, why are you doing this?

101
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,210
Let's go.

102
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,410
Uh, Hang on!

103
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,060
I'm sorry.

104
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,930
It's okay.

105
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,990
More importantly,
I'm worried about Kei and Atsuko.

106
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,730
Thank you.

107
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,830
Yuko...

108
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,300
The time has finally come
for my wish to come true.

109
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,060
What?!

110
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,940
Yuko!

111
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,900
Kei!

112
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,570
So, you've come. But it's too late!

113
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,240
I want you to watch
what I am about to do!

114
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,480
Yuko!

115
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,520
We're almost done, sis.

116
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,860
Yuko!

117
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,270
What?!

118
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,520
A good-for-nothing beast.

119
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,930
Take this!

120
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,310
Is that all you've got?!
You little insect!

121
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,090
I'm sorry for taking so long!
I'll untie you!

122
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,920
Jun.

123
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,390
Kei!

124
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,260
Kei, are you all right?

125
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,680
Yuko... Yuko...

126
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,980
Mari...

127
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,450
Mari?! Why, you!

128
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,950
Kenji!

129
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,100
Mari!

130
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,800
Watch it!

131
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,170
Sis...!

132
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,560
You've come back, sis.

133
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,850
I've been...
I've been waiting so long.

134
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,920
Why did you leave me, sis?

135
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,990
The smell of my sister...

136
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,320
Sis...

137
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,040
My expectations were too high.

138
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,850
Things don't always go
the way you want them to.

139
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,180
Well, I'll have to come up
with another plan.
