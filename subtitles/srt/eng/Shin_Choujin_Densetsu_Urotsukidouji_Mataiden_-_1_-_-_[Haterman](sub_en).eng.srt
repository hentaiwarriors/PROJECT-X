00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,224
Now, let my god Astara Odin

Cowards... Don't they realize
that only HE can give...

10
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:41,712
...the Third Reich dominion
over the 3 realms?

11
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,177
Now! Begin the process!

12
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,699
What are you doing?

13
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:42,970
Papa! It's overloading!

14
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,005
- Something's wrong...!
- Impossible!

15
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,535
My Lord of Chaos comes!

Munhi Hausen!
What's gone wrong?!

18
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,508
My Lord of Chaos...

19
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:55,881
Your failure to the Fuhrer
will not be tolerated!

20
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:34,247

You called,
Munhi Hausen?

23
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:11,418
You wasted
no time, Kohoki.

24
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:15,947
You're the only human who
never runs from me.

25
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:18,516
So?
What is it this time?

26
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:21,689
Do you wish
to kill the Overfiend?

27
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:25,928
THE OVERFIEND?!
Sure, I'd love to.

28
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:29,028
But I'm not crazy enough
to actually try!

29
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:33,904
Whoever kills the Overfiend
will control the 3 realms.

30
00:07:35,244 --> 00:07:36,643
No thanks.

31
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:42,777
Unlike certain humans I know,
I rather prefer staying alive!

32
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:45,379
Do you wish
to return to Hell?

33
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:53,062
W-wait! All right!
I'll help you!

34
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:57,393
I'll help you...

I hate this stupid place!
Where're you taking me?!

41
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,976
Hey! HEY!!!

42
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:54,121
Where can he be?
He's gonna be too late!

43
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:03,632
I won't let you take
another step in here!

44
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,466
Why do you
defile this place?!

45
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:13,965
What's keeping him?

46
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:17,137
And he has the nerve to say
what a high and mighty...

47
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:21,983
Boss! Where were you?
I've been waiting!

48
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:37,659
What is it?
What happened?

49
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:46,835
That did it?
No?

50
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:50,839
Human...
A human did this?!

51
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:57,849
A human who controls
a demon? But why?

52
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,849
Overfiend's...
natural enemy.

53
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:04,324
Natural enemy?

54
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:08,192
Beware, Amano Jyaku...

55
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:15,466
Boss, look at this!

56
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:20,698
It's the guardian
deity of my people!

57
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,406
So you guys have
someone you worship?

58
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:32,549
Actually, my grandpa says
these ruins are 4000 years old.

59
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:36,888
What?! 4000 years old?
That's impossible.

60
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,223
They'd be older than the
legend of the Overfiend!

61
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:42,560
And nothing's
older than that...

62
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,200
Something's up, outside.
Come on, Kuroko!

63
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,897
Yessir!

64
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,247
What's going on?

65
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:03,782
Amano Jyaku...

66
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:07,017
It's Mimi!

67
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:08,784
Lady Mimi!

68
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:12,419
You alone? Why're you out
here at Prison's Gate?

69
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:18,262
I thought we could do it here,
without Grandpa to stop us.

70
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:21,133
Okay, I getcha.
A quickie?

71
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:23,263
More than that!

72
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,029
Boss, wait!

73
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:29,110
If the Elder finds out you're
with his granddaughter...

74
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:34,280
Oh, you're so good,
Amano Jyaku...

75
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:38,985
You're just gonna do it
out here, you... ANIMAL!

76
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:42,286
Shut up and go help Megumi
keep an eye on Nagumo!

77
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:44,223
Yes, sir...

78
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:03,037
We watch him all the time,
and nothing ever happens!

79
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:07,214
Don't talk like that!
It's the Boss's orders.

80
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:15,317
Boy, you're all smiles.
Are you really that happy?

81
00:12:15,992 --> 00:12:19,291
Of course! I haven't seen
my cousin in 10 years.

82
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:22,058
I wonder what
Takeaki's like now.

83
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:25,965
You're that close...
I think I'm jealous!

84
00:12:35,678 --> 00:12:38,442
You two were
like brothers.

85
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:43,542
Oh yes! Maybe even closer,
don't you think, dear?

86
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:47,248
Oh yes. Tatsuo must be
quite the young man, now.

87
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:51,020
You'll have fun with him,
like when you were children.

88
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,688
- They're not kids anymore!
- Yes, you're right!

89
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:02,061
Is that it?

90
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:04,402
Yeah!
That's the plane!

91
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:19,955
Captain! We've got a
problem in the #4 engine.

92
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:22,217
Captain? Captain!

93
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:40,736
What the hell?!

94
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,272
Mom!

95
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:50,752
Mom! Dad!

96
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:54,516
Takeaki...

97
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,001
- Takeaki!
- Nagumo!

98
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:20,515
Demons, I'll bet...
But why?!

99
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:28,949
Hold off on that side!
Careful, now!

100
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:36,465
Over here! Hurry!
I think he's still alive!

101
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:44,795
Takeaki... Takeaki...
He's gotta be okay...

102
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,699
Takeaki...

103
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:51,642
He needs blood
immediately! Hurry now!

104
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,982
TAKEAKI!!!

105
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,316
No!
You can't go in there!

106
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:00,116
- Lemme go!
- Hey...!

107
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:01,781
Takeaki!

108
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:05,426
TAKEAKI!

109
00:15:07,563 --> 00:15:10,157
Doctor, you gotta help him.
He's my cousin!

110
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,898
My blood... Give him my blood!
We're both type O!

111
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:17,829
Doctor, please!

112
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,835
Come with us.

113
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:34,516
Megumi, a transfusion
from Nagumo...?

114
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:49,004
And so Takeaki Kiryu,
the lone survivor of...

115
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:52,507
...the airline crash 4 days ago
is set to be released tomorrow.

116
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,703
Congratulations! Let's hope he
gets over this tragedy soon.

117
00:15:56,212 --> 00:15:59,147
And on that note, next up
is the Mu Orchestra...

118
00:15:59,215 --> 00:16:01,206
...with "Sole Survivor".
Enjoy!

119
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:07,888
Yeah...

120
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:12,558
Like that... Yes!
Oh yes...

121
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:22,102
Can't believe how
horny she is... Oh well!

122
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:34,905
Perfect!

123
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:39,577
Yeah, just try and
catch up with me!

124
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,055
Pretty fast.

125
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,593
What's he driving?

126
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,565
Did you hear
news this morning?

127
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,270
Yeah. On the the highway.
What's happening to this city?!

128
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:38,142
I'm scared...

129
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:43,481
Don't be! I'm always with you,
and I'll always protect you!

130
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:45,315
- You mean it?
- Sure.

131
00:17:46,488 --> 00:17:49,321
Same old,
same old...

132
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,623
So, Megumi, do you think the
Demons caused the latest murder?

133
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,166
Nope...

134
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:01,826
We've lost Nagumo!

135
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:04,737
Forget him. I'm waiting
for someone else.

136
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:06,274
Megumi-i-i-i!

137
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:09,101
She's always here.
Hurry up and find her!

138
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,140
Megumi?
Are you here?

139
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:17,117
Where are you,
Megumi?

140
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:19,518
What do you
want this early?

141
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:22,013
Megumi!

142
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:28,853
Please have some! I hope you
like this batch, too!

143
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:31,529
Again?

144
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,361
Oh well...

145
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:44,941
- Captain!
- Captain, snap out of it!

146
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:52,483
Still...?

147
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:53,714
Yeah...

148
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:59,227
I want him! If we had
him on the team...

149
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:05,058
Hold it!

150
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:08,330
Try me!

151
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:12,568
You're strong, but I don't
think you can beat me.

152
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:18,903
It's him...!

153
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:22,075
I don't fight girls.

154
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:55,107
You win!

155
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:56,947
Megumi!

156
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,124
Sorry. I guess I went
a little crazy just now.

157
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:10,632
By the way, you really should
wear something under that.

158
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:13,801
My name's
Takeaki Kiryu.

159
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:17,530
Sorry I acted like that.
I'm pleased to know you!

160
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:22,305
Not half as pleased as me!
We need a guy like you!

161
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:23,970
You're incredible!

162
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:32,443
Same 'ol Tatsuo.

163
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:36,821
I guess... But when did you
get so good at fighting?

164
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:38,860
The whole school's
talking about you!

165
00:20:39,728 --> 00:20:42,492
I got good at it in school
when I was in London.

166
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:46,000
Man! And you were such a
crybaby when we were kids!

167
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:49,162
You only just got out of
the hospital yesterday.

168
00:20:49,238 --> 00:20:51,172
Don't push yourself!

169
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:55,170
Thanks for worrying
about me, Akemi.

170
00:20:55,844 --> 00:20:57,778
I was worried, too!

171
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,383
Megumi...!

172
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,848
I'm Megumi Amano.
How do you do?

173
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:09,957
H-hi...

174
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:13,392
You were great.
A real champion!

175
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:16,363
Strong men make
me weak in the knees.

176
00:21:16,432 --> 00:21:19,367
You're a cheerful
one, aren't you?

177
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:22,060
But!

178
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:26,335
Next time, don't hold
back when fighting me.

179
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:27,466
You won't lose, then.

180
00:21:28,043 --> 00:21:30,204
S-sure...

181
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:35,039
You fought Megumi?!

182
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:40,778
The secret's out!
So, tell me about yourself.

183
00:21:40,856 --> 00:21:42,824
Gotta girlfriend?

184
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,856
Oh no you don't, Megumi!
You're not corrupting HIM!

185
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:50,387
Oh, too bad.
There's the bell.

186
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:53,230
Guess we'll have to continue
this after school. Let's go!

187
00:21:57,005 --> 00:21:58,165
Jerk!

188
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:01,801
I suck at Math and Chem...
They're just too boring.

189
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:05,836
Takeaki!
See ya later!

190
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:11,575
Megumi... huh?

191
00:22:11,653 --> 00:22:14,247
Hey Takeaki!
We gotta go!

192
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:22,260
Almost had him...

193
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:27,595
Megumi, shouldn't we
tell the Boss about this?

194
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,035
Megumi?

195
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:31,504
Huh?

196
00:22:31,573 --> 00:22:34,440
What's with you?!

197
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,305
- Really?
- That's right.

198
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:45,285
I can't believe you were
released only 3 days ago!

199
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,110
Yeah...

200
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:52,789
I'd really like to thank you
for everything you've done...

201
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:55,421
Especially finding that
apartment for me...

202
00:22:55,497 --> 00:23:00,628
What're you talking about?!
We're family, right Mom?

203
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:02,101
Exactly.

204
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,628
And if there's any problem there,
be sure and ask us for help.

205
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:09,167
Or if you need
anything to fix it up.

206
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:10,939
S-sure...

207
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:13,641
It's a shame
about your parents...

208
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:16,411
But you survived, and that's
something to be thankful for.

209
00:23:16,485 --> 00:23:19,943
I wish we could've done more
for the funeral service, though...

210
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:24,322
Would you two cut it out?
He's just gotten over it...

211
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:29,092
Forget it, Tatsuo. You've all
been so great to me.

212
00:23:29,164 --> 00:23:31,689
Sorry I brought it up.

213
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:32,859
Forgive us.

214
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:36,996
Oh Dad, you should get Takeaki
some sportswear next time.

215
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:40,337
He's turned into a real jock
since we were kids!

216
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:45,536
Yes, I can see that.
He's looking great!

217
00:23:45,614 --> 00:23:47,673
A real man, now.

218
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,344
- Yes, a fine young man...
- Very fine...

219
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:56,582
You'll have fun with him,
like when you were children.

220
00:23:56,658 --> 00:24:01,027
- They're not kids anymore!
- Yes, you're right!

221
00:24:08,203 --> 00:24:09,170
Not again...!

222
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:13,707
- What's wrong?
- Are you alright, son?

223
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:16,676
I'm fine.
Just a little dizzy.

224
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:18,804
Maybe you have
been overdoing it.

225
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,543
Yes, I think you should go
home and get some rest.

226
00:24:24,486 --> 00:24:29,048
Oh man, it's just
like with Ozaki!

227
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:38,724
Takeaki!
Need some help?

228
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:42,759
I'm fine, really!

229
00:24:42,838 --> 00:24:44,863
I'll take you someplace
really great tomorrow.

230
00:24:45,674 --> 00:24:48,074
See you tomorrow, Tatsuo.

231
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:53,307
I hope he's all right...

232
00:24:53,382 --> 00:24:57,716
I guess he's going
home alone... Huh...?

233
00:24:57,786 --> 00:24:59,981
Where'd you go?
Megumi?

234
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:18,799
In other news, a man's
body was discovered...

235
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:21,434
...in Nishiguchi Park
early this morning.

236
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,502
The man, identified as
Mr. Masahiko Aida of...

237
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:27,571
...Nerima District, is believed
to be the latest victim...

238
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:30,117
...of the so-called
"Night Stalker".

239
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:34,315
The discovery of a lady's handbag
on the scene supports this theory.

240
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,590
No... I don't know
anything about it!

241
00:25:39,661 --> 00:25:40,821
I don't know...

242
00:25:43,965 --> 00:25:46,331
No! It isn't me!

243
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:49,802
Dad, Mom... Help me...

244
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:55,138
He's fighting
the blood inside him...

245
00:26:00,215 --> 00:26:02,080
Damn!
Where'd he go?!

246
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:21,996
It's ready.

247
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,799
Looks good.

248
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,638
I try my best!
Shall I open the wine?

249
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:29,506
Sure. I'd love some.

250
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:32,077
There you go.

251
00:26:32,147 --> 00:26:33,671
Thanks, dear.

252
00:26:35,684 --> 00:26:38,585
Oh, Takeaki,
you're home!

253
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:42,680
Come in. I'll let
you drink with me.

254
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:47,186
Dad... Mom!

255
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,534
What's wrong, son?
Come in already!

256
00:27:36,244 --> 00:27:40,738
Awaken, Takeaki.
Awaken...

257
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,261
I've been waiting.

258
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:07,438
Who...
Who are you?

259
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:10,603
My name is Munhi Hausen.

260
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,672
And I am here to lead
you to your final form.

261
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,441
Final form...?

262
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,683
This form you now take
is merely temporary.

263
00:28:21,756 --> 00:28:26,386
Takeaki Kiryu died
in that plane crash.

264
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:33,124
I have caused
you to be reborn.

265
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:35,761
So that we may
carry out our destiny.

266
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:40,274
No! My parents died in
the crash, but I'm still alive!

267
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:42,776
And my cousin's family
has been so kind to me...

268
00:28:42,844 --> 00:28:44,573
I owe them so much!

269
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:46,978
Kind to you?

270
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,178
You really believe
their hypocrisy?

271
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:54,984
Human kindness
is merely a sham.

272
00:28:56,157 --> 00:29:00,321
Humans always feel superior
to those they see in need.

273
00:29:00,395 --> 00:29:04,161
They are kind only to absolve
themselves of the guilt they feel.

274
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:08,261
That is the essence of
"good will towards others".

275
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:11,999
Let me show you the true
nature of the human heart!

276
00:29:14,276 --> 00:29:18,770
I'd really like to thank you
for everything you've done...

277
00:29:19,281 --> 00:29:21,772
Especially finding that
apartment for me...

278
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,284
You'd better be!
It costs a bundle!

279
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,788
As if the funeral
didn't cost enough!

280
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:33,686
My goddam brother dies and
leaves me his kid to pay for...!

281
00:29:33,762 --> 00:29:36,754
Do you realize how much
trouble you're causing us?!

282
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:55,205
What are you up to?!

283
00:29:56,151 --> 00:29:58,210
You must be the
Beast-Girl, Megumi.

284
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,018
And you're no
ordinary human!

285
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,725
We will meet again.
In good time...

286
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:14,224
Who the hell was he?

287
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:17,403
And what does
he want with Takeaki?

288
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:21,404
He's gone!

289
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:30,302
Relax, it was
just a dream.

290
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:32,113
But...

291
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,672
I said I'd take you
to a great place, right?

292
00:31:37,085 --> 00:31:39,110
Here it is!

293
00:31:39,187 --> 00:31:40,711
THIS is it?!

294
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:46,486
I'm outta here...

295
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:47,323
Wha- Takeaki,
hold on a sec!

296
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:50,023
I'm blowing my whole
allowance on you, man!

297
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:54,460
Cut it out! Tatsuo, l...
Leggo...!

298
00:32:01,342 --> 00:32:03,401
Well?
Pretty cool, huh?

299
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,853
Tatsuo... Do you come
here all the time?

300
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:20,853
Loosen up, man!
I'm going next door.

301
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:40,540
I can't handle this...

302
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:11,041
Oh man...

303
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:14,843
Hand job, sir?
Only 3000 yen.

304
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:24,553
It's just too much...

305
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:28,084
Hand job, mister?
Only 3000 yen.

306
00:33:29,264 --> 00:33:33,928
A h-h-hand j-j...!
No thanks! I'm fine!

307
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,603
Megumi! What are
you doing here?!

308
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,940
I followed you!

309
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:46,139
Come on, Takeaki. I'll make
you feel REAL good...

310
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:52,285
No...! Cut it out! I can't
believe you're doing this!

311
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:56,552
Cut it out...

312
00:33:57,959 --> 00:34:00,689
First time?
That's so cute!

313
00:34:00,762 --> 00:34:03,526
Hey, for another 5000 yen,
I'll let you suck them.

314
00:34:03,598 --> 00:34:08,092
Huh? What's going on?
I feel so strange.

315
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:10,660
I feel like they're being sucked,
but there's nothing there!

316
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:14,141
Kuroko, you little...!
What're you...?!

317
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:19,974
Megumi, please...!

318
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:29,316
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?!

319
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:32,919
Let's book.

320
00:34:33,494 --> 00:34:36,486
Hold it! Someone's
gotta pay for this!

321
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:40,498
Come on!

322
00:34:47,675 --> 00:34:49,336
There's no more...

323
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:02,454
What the...?!

324
00:35:05,126 --> 00:35:07,458
Megumi,
how are you...?

325
00:35:07,528 --> 00:35:10,361
I'm not human.
Surprised?

326
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:14,866
You're not quite
human either, now.

327
00:35:17,438 --> 00:35:23,377
Relax, it's okay. I know
what's been happening to you.

328
00:35:27,315 --> 00:35:29,340
You may
not believe it...

329
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:33,285
But not all the people in
this world are human.

330
00:35:33,354 --> 00:35:35,686
There are Demons and
Man-Beasts here, too...

331
00:35:44,332 --> 00:35:47,733
So Tatsuo is this...
this "Overfiend?"

332
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,064
Yes...

333
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:55,365
That blood transfusion made
you a "quasi" Overfiend...

334
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:58,071
That's what's causing the
changes in your body.

335
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:00,540
So that's it...

336
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:04,051
I'm sorry if this
is all such a shock.

337
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:05,710
Maybe I shouldn't
have told you.

338
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:10,315
That's okay. But can you
tell me one more thing?

339
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:11,050
What?

340
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:14,094
What's going
to happen to me?

341
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:23,937
I don't know...

342
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:31,111
But I had no idea Tatsuo has
such an important destiny...

343
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,773
It sort of makes my
destiny look unimportant.

344
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:40,254
He'll have his powers
manifest someday...

345
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:42,789
I can't do anything
about that.

346
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:47,889
But I'm going to fight it!
This blood inside of me.

347
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:53,623
Yeah! I know you
can do it, Takeaki...

348
00:36:54,969 --> 00:36:56,129
Oh yeah...

349
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,599
Here. The King of my
realm gave it to me.

350
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:01,141
Take it, for good luck.

351
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:04,208
Thanks, Megumi...

352
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:10,650
Yokohama!

353
00:37:10,718 --> 00:37:12,652
- Beautiful...
- Isn't it?

354
00:37:13,554 --> 00:37:14,816
I mean you.

355
00:37:17,058 --> 00:37:21,825
Oh for Pete's...
Don't say that! Come on!

356
00:37:40,181 --> 00:37:43,810
What's wrong? Something's
draining my powers.

357
00:37:43,885 --> 00:37:45,512
Megumi!

358
00:37:53,861 --> 00:37:57,194
A demon!
Let's go!

359
00:38:01,035 --> 00:38:02,297
That creature...

360
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:10,042
Takeaki!

361
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:12,706
Megumi!

362
00:38:16,484 --> 00:38:18,384
Who are you?!
Lemme go!

363
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,056
It's only been 100 years.
Have you forgotten my name?

364
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:26,059
I'll help you
to remember!

365
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:37,667
What are you
doing here, Kohoki?!

366
00:38:37,738 --> 00:38:40,707
Don't be so cold.

367
00:38:40,775 --> 00:38:45,109
I came to the human realm
so that I could win you back.

368
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:50,513
That's one way to put it!
Take over my mind, more likely!

369
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:54,248
You still really believe you
can take me as your wife?!

370
00:38:54,755 --> 00:38:59,249
I fell in love with you.
100 years ago.

371
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:07,959
When my queen found out,
I was cast into Hell for all eternity.

372
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:14,203
It just made you all
the more desirable.

373
00:39:15,877 --> 00:39:18,175
So you broke
out of Hell, huh?

374
00:39:19,947 --> 00:39:23,280
I broke out so I can
have your lovely body!

375
00:39:56,984 --> 00:40:00,920
I thought Takeaki was
causing all those murders...

376
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:05,322
But there's more, isn't there?
Kohoki, are you in on that?!

377
00:40:05,826 --> 00:40:08,920
That's my secret.
Just take my word:

378
00:40:08,996 --> 00:40:12,762
Stay away from that kid,
for your own good!

379
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,562
So there
is a connection!

380
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:20,966
And that human's
behind this, too!

381
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:23,340
What do you
two want?

382
00:40:25,012 --> 00:40:29,346
All I want
is your BODY!

383
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:08,385
What's wrong, Megumi?
Quick today?

384
00:41:08,456 --> 00:41:13,393
We'll be joined together
in a grand, eternal climax!

385
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:40,719
I can't fight it.

386
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:45,088
Help me, Big Brother...
Help me...

387
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,750
TAKEAKI!

388
00:42:00,941 --> 00:42:02,431
Yes...

389
00:42:21,062 --> 00:42:23,053
He awakens.

390
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,476
With this,
the 3 realms are mine!
