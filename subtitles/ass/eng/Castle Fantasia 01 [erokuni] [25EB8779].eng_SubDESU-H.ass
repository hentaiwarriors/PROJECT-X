Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.85,0:10:13.60,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}Yes. I am mistaken.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.15,0:10:17.14,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}War itself is an insane concept to begin with.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.76,0:10:21.05,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}That's why, even little by little, I want to put an end to war.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.63,0:10:24.18,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}Hypothetically, in any possible form.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.66,0:10:28.46,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}I suppose so.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.01,0:10:33.94,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}It would be nice if both sides could nicely shake hands with as little animosity as possible, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:34.39,0:10:38.29,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}Now that several hundred years have passed, we've both gone too far to back out,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.71,0:10:41.00,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}and because of that, it has become necessary to use these tactics.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.16,0:10:48.15,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}That's why, Commander, instead of peace, you want to defeat Boleblade fortress...

Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.13,0:11:32.33,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}books on the arts of romance would be much more fitting to you.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.30,0:11:53.06,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}All troops, attack!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:59.65,0:12:01.68,Castle Fantasia main,,0,0,0,,{\be1}Hewie, I'm counting on you.
